0|1789-restaurant-washington|The restaurants name was inspired by an important year in Washingtons history, in which the Constitution of the United States was adopted and the village of Georgetown - the restaurants site - was incorporated. Situated in a Federal period house, it has six dining areas, each with its own name and distinctive character. The menu, which is both upscale and pricey, features traditional American cuisine with contemporary touches, with offerings such as rack of lamb, grilled pork, and roast salmon, and a vegetable sampler for those who eschew meat. There is a pre-theater prix-fixe menu available weekdays before 6:45pm - three courses, with coffee or tea, for only $30.00, a considerable savings over the a la carte prices. The service was not unfriendly, but certainly more formal than casual. While no strict dress code is enforced, we felt more comfortable in our sports jackets and dress slacks than we would have had we been wearing jeans., I fell in love with this place when I had the filet mignon with blue cheese butter. MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. Waiters are great too. A friend and I were trying to decide between three desserts. The waiter brought us all of them, one on the house., A great highend restaurant in Georgetown. Impeccable service, even during Restaurant Week. The big question mark is how they survive the transition to a new chef., 1789 is a wonderful restaurant with an attentive staff. The food is impeccable and the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxed. Parking is not a problem as they have complimentary valet. For the true Washington, D.C. culinary experience do try 1789., We were told that our corner spot was considered one of the most romantic tables in all of Washington, D.C. We created our own four course tasting menus, with each of us ordering different dishes for every course, paired with a different glass of wine for each dish. It was decadent!We started with a salmon carpaccio, which was so fresh and flavored well, and a tasty grilled shrimp appetizer. The next course included foie gras, always rich but always a favorite of mine, and equally luxe seared scallops. Our main course consisted of rack of lamb, which was really starting to fill my already protruding tummy at this point, and rockfish, a local yummy fish. We finished off our meal with a really interesting toasted bread pudding which was almost more like creme brulee. (I couldnt possibly do two desserts, though I did indulge in both dessert wine and champagne!)It was the PERFECT engagement dinner., This is one of my favorite restaurants for special occassions. The service is amazing. I went there for my anniversary last year. My waiter surprised me with a birthday card and dessert, because he thought it was my birthday. My waiter was attentive, without being intrusive. I would definitely suggest this restaurant for special occasions., I had the pleasure of going here for the first time for Restaurant Week in January 2006. My boyfriend and I went and sat in the John Carroll room right in front of the fireplace. Tres romantic! It took a little while for our server to present the menu and wine list which left us wondering if we would ever get a waiter....For my first course I had the scallop margarita - scallops in a lime sauce with avocado and tequila ice ball. Very very full of interesting flavors. The boy had the oyster soup and it contained very large, done to perfection oysters. For the second course I had the rack of lamb with feta potatoes and garlic spinach. Ive since heard that this dish is a DC classic, and while eating it I could taste why. The lamb was tender and the potatoes were out of this world. He had the grilled monkfish served over scallops and garlic spinach. Id never had monkfish before and it was very good and meatier than I expected. Our third course was dessert and I got the lemon marscapone cheesecake and he got the chocolate cake. Both were very rich and left us VERY full. Overall, the service was great (our glasses were never empty) and the food was delicious. It was the perfect night out and Im so glad I finally got a chance to go there. A lot of people said it was going down hill after the new chef came on board but I definitely think the chef deserves kudos.Unfortch they are no longer participating in RW but that is due to their $35 pre-fixe theather menu they offer all of the time and I would say that is a pretty good deal as well. Definitely a DC fave of mine!, Brilliant. Thats the best word to describe this restaurant in its entirety. Walking through historic Georgetown, you will find this restaurant in a restored federal home where the five dining areas (all gorgeous) are furnished with many American antiques (which I am quick to admire) and other period pieces, though Im not really a fan of anything equestrian and there is plenty of that too. The last time I dined here was when Ris Lacoste was at the helm, as she was for 10 years, but she has since left to open her own restaurant. I know absolutely nothing about the new chef, Nathan Beauchamp, but I cannot imagine the Laythams not doing the proper due diligence in replacing a star chef (who only announced she was quitting the day after competing in the Iron Chef competition). That being said, the food was impeccable then - truly divine, but I wont comment on any particular dishes, 1- because the Chef I know left, 2) because their menu changes daily anyway and 3) Im sure Nathan Beauchamp has his own style of cooking and therefore should be judged accordingly. Luckily the pastry chef has remained. If you ever have the opportunity to have the bergamot ice cream (think: Earl Grey tea), do it. Delicious! Brunch, and Im sure that is never prepared by the Executive Chef anyway so I feel safe in saying this, is fabulous! An absolute must. The service is excellent, never warm and cuddly, but very proficient and professional - handling large groups really well. Lastly, I love the comp valet and wish more restaurants would be so gracious.**OPINION PRINCESS HOT TIP** I was delighted to learn that on their website you can print out a coupon to try out the new chefs 3-course prix fixe meal for $35 - offer only good through Sept 13., One of the very best, fancy, elegant restaurants in DC, appropriately located in Georgetown to match its upper-class atmosphere. My wonderful girlfriend took me here for my birthday recently, and I loved every minute of the meal-- from the exemplary service, to the fabulous wine we enjoyed, and then theres the outstanding food-- I had a delicious scallops-lobster appetizer, a main course of duck breast, and topped it all off at the end with an incredibly rich, scrumptious hazelnut chocolate cake! I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion or to impress out-of-town visitors., If you want to have a very formal dinner in the Georgetown area, this is the place to go. Jackets are preferred for men and the service is white-glove all the way. The menu changes regularly, but I had the duck when I was there and it was excellent. The waitress recommended it Medium Rare, but I went the medium and it was still very tender. My other friends ordered the filet and were not disappointed. The entrees are a little small, so I would recommend going with an appetizer or salad to start. Youll leave much lighter in the wallet, but your stomach will thank you for it., Man... I dont get it. And Ive tried over and over again! And Im sure Ill try again... But cmon...The menu is unimaginative at best, laden with gamy meats and heavy uninspired sauces. The sides are common, nothing out of the ordinary. Excellent service earns the 3 Stars, but save your money and go somewhere else., My friends and I went to 1789 for Restaurant Week, since this is probably the only chance Il get as a student to eat there!The Restaurant Week deal is really great: 3 courses for just $30 (unless you order the lamb or the sirloin, add another $10). They have a great selection for all 3 courses, which means there something for everyone.First course: The bluefin tuna came with parsley root, crisped baguette, baby leeks, and sweet and sour plums. An interesting combo of flavors that worked really well for me. BUT if you don like sashimi, this tuna doesn come cooked so I would get something else. The Pistachio Crusted Lamb was my main course and I absolutely LOVED it. It only comes with 2 pieces of lamb, 2 goat cheese tortellini, and a cerignola olive and garlic confit. The pasta part of the tortellini was really thick so it hadn cooked all the way through and was kind of tough to chew. The goat cheese filling, however, was delicious. The confit was a pleasant surprise and absolutely amazing. The lamb.....how good it was!!! Ordered medium rare, the lamb was perfectly tender with just the right amount of fat to keep it moist. The pistachio crust was crunchy and added a great textural contrast to the meat. It was definitely worth the extra $10!For dessert: Warm apple crostada. It wasn my favorite apple dessert compared to some others (J. Paul apple pie is better in my opinion). The apples were sliced too thinly and there weren enough of them so the slightly too thick and chewy crust (at least for my taste) overpowered the dessert. They were skimpy on the streusel topping which was disappointing for me.I had high expectations for 1789, which might be why I came out a bit disappointed. Maybe I being too harsh on 1789, but for the amount they charge, I rather go to Fogo de Chao and eat all I can eat. The portions are a bit small, so I glad I ate a lot of bread and butter before getting my appetizer. My stomach was pleasantly full and the lamb was delicious (which is why I giving it 4 stars instead of 3), but I don see a need to make my parents take me there when I graduate!, The food was great. We took a friend here for a birthday, they have complimentary valet and the staff is very attentive. This is an older crowd so dont go expecting a ton of young people and it can seem a bit stuffy., I ate here last summer with high expectations. I wasnt impressed by the menu or the quality or presentation of the food. It was good but not as incredible as everyone makes it out to be.I plan to give it another go this summer (theyre running a prix-fixe deal through sept) so look for an update :) I would love to be proven wrong., How could I resist? Was in town for just a few days and people had been yelping about this restaurant. Took someones advice and got that coupon for the prix fixed meal $36 per person (appetizer, main course and dessert) off restaurants website - valid until september 2007. Good times. Frankly, cheaper than the other high-end restaurant we went to a few nights before. I had the parpadelle appetizer. Yummy. Very fresh pasta (you could really tell it had just been made) with a few grape tomatoes sliced in half, little bits of sausage. Just the right start. For my main course, I selected the pan seared scallops. Again, very tastey. And I am very particular about scallops. These were done perfectly, and were accompanied in the dish with fava beans. Dessert was the mixed berry tart. It was ok, but nothing to rave about. I will say the wine by the bottle list was very expensive, only a few selections under $50. However, the wine by the glass menu was very reasonable (especially given that other high-end restaurant was serving glasses of wine for $15-16 per glass *outrageous*). I chose the red zinfandel ($8) per glass. Really thought it was nice with my choices. All in all - a good meal to end a vacay on. BTW - this restaurant is in a historic building, with decor to match. I thought it was cute. Free valet parking. Oh, and for the men - jackets required, but they will loan you one for dinner - they have a wide selection! Opentable.com reservations available too., Classic. Great service, elegant and of course, truly great food. Special place for special time.Have not been there for a while, so I do not know if it is still good...., Awesome. Every Georgetown student knows that when your parents come to town, this is the place you should go. Its a bazillion course meal, and everything is beyond delicious. But it comes at a price!, This was one of the best experiences Ive ever had. A true high end restaurant, with food, service and ambiance to back it up. Jackets required for men, but they happily offer one for you if you dont have one. Valet parking, and if its raining, umbrella service to your car.The womens bathroom is quaint and pretty, the place is a bit on smallish and quiet side, but very nice regardless. I highly recommend this place, but be prepared to spend some money. Great selection of wine, great tasting food. I almost licked my plate clean. =), They have a summer special that I couldnt resist! They have a $36 pre-fixe menu where you can choose an appetizer, entree and dessert. Men must wear a jacket here - I believe otherwise they supply one for you. The ambiance is very comfortable here despite the need for guys to wear a jacket. The decor definitely puts you in the mind set of a historical place. Each dining room is different in appearance, and we sat in the John Carroll Room. Even the bathrooms are cute. They look so classical and victorian - like a time piece. We were seated with such beautiful dishware in front of us. I wanted to take one home. I started with some type of crab and mango salad dish , and I also tried everyone elses appetizers - the beet salad, tomato salad, steak tartare, soup, and the risotto. For my entree, I had the Pan Roasted Filet and it was cooked to perfection! It was very juicy and tender as good the lamb that I tasted that my cousin had. The desserts were to die for - I had the Berries Tart, and it was the best tart I ever had. The Chocolate Flourless Dome was as rich as the Chocolate Truffle. This deal cant be beat - if you are around you shouldnt pass it up!, First and foremost, the service here is out of this world. Our server was on top of his game and definitely knew when to come around and had enough ppl helping him so that we were never in need. He was fabulous at making suggestions and even noticed that I had the special summer prix fixe certificate in hand before I could say a word. I almost felt a bit out of place as 1789 is definitely an upscale restaurant with old world charm and I think I was a little underdressed. I loved taking in all the unique decor adorning the walls. The lighting was perfect for table conversation.And the most important part of the meal: food! My first entree consisted of fresh clams with basil and chorizo. Definitely an unusual pairing that was good but I dont necessarily think they went well together. Nevertheless, good ingredients individually. My main entree was shrimp with mangoes and red peppers. One word: YUM! A perfect light and refreshing entree. The shrimp were plump and cooked to the perfect doneness. The mangoes were ripe and complimented the dish incredibly. For dessert, I had the flour-less chocolate cake and this was quite possibly the best chocolate cake I have eaten in my life. The consistency was just short of being comparable to ice cream. The scoop of coffee ice cream was a great compliment to the dish.Overall, I can see why 1789 has flourished for so long! They have perfected the recipe for a great dining experience., So, my boyfriend took me here for valentine and let me just say that the boy has great taste. I am usually the kind of girl that eats a salad bar for lunch and like, barely lives above the poverty line so this was a real treat for me...After dropping off our car with the free valet service, we were seated in the civil war room which was neat because the decor was all antique paintings and items from that period, certainly a conversation topic in itself. The service was very attentive. By attentive, I mean that they favor the ladies. My date wanted to look at the dessert menu before I was done with my dinner (I was finishing up), but the waiter didn let him because it would have been rude to the lady. Hehe. Ok enough about that. The wine is amazing! it worth going there just for the wine. Delectable, just ....heavenly. ie never had wine like that before. We didn even order anything expensive, just a bottle of french white that sounded appealing. We thought about ordering the pre-theatre menu, but decided to go with a la carte instead. Reputedly it is the best rack of lamb in DC, so I had to get that. I was pleased. The salad and the blood orange ice cream also did not disappoint.What really made me smile were the little appetizers and the little dessert cookies that are served at the end., One of my favourite restaurants in DC to dine with my parents, but definitely very traditional...if you dont dress appropriately, they wont let you in the door - theyre absolutely happy to shoo you over to Tombs or Wisemillers next door for that matter.Largely because its an expensive restaurant, you get top-notch service even if youre not a regular there which is nice for a change. Id have to say that the decor is a bit too...old-fashioned for my taste, but its definitely very beautiful and well-kept. Fair-portioned plates, you wont get any whimsical courses -- very traditional overall. However...I was disappointed to hear that they got a new chef; theres just something lacking in the place/dishes now. I wouldnt recommend this place though for a casual dinner with friends; its definitely somewhere for special occasions. Ill definitely come back even though they got a new chef - Im too loyal., I went here in January for my birthday & loved it. They extended their restaurant week dinner menu for the entire month so we got some great food at a good price. Great ambiance and good food. Would definitely go back.Also, my friends called ahead to tell them it was my birthday. They gave me a card & put a candle in my dessert. So if you go for a special occasion, tell them in advance., Wee glad we came, the food was good, but we won be coming back.My husband picked a restaurant for our fifth anniversary dinner by going to Yelp and finding a top-rated restaurant that I hadn reviewed. 1789 was near the top of that list, so he made a reservation for us through Open Table. Under the Notes section he commented that it was our fifth wedding anniversary.I didn know until we we were on the way in the cab what our destination was, and I was excited by the prospect of eating here. I been here once before, but it was over a decade ago, My hopes were high for a special experience.We were seated quickly, but waited about 10 minutes for menus and water. In fact, after we got the menus, we asked for sparkling water, but got flat water. Oh well, mistakes happen. The water was replaced quickly. Our waiter seemed busy, or distracted, or something. No matter -- we perused the menu and discussed our options. Despite the offering of delectable-sounding entrees such as soft-shelled crabs, or lobster tail, we ended up picking the tasting menu with the wine pairing, so that we could taste a greater variety of things, plus take advantage of the sommelier expertise.The first thing to arrive was an amuse bouche of cucumber slice with a seafood salad. This was kind of like a ceviche, except with no citrus. It really had very little flavor at all. As I said after swallowing, My bouche is not amused. Good thing that was just an extra. Our first dish was an exquisite serving of thinly sliced raw hamachi, with an avocado cream, daikon and Meyer lemon. This was very good, and the Spanish white that accompanied it was good, if a little intense for the fish. Second dish was steamed red snapper, and this was a really nice cut of fish. I liked this wine pairing better.Third was rack of lamb. We were told this was the specialty of the house. It was very good, though bloodier than the medium-rare we had requested. An Italian red complemented it perfectly. This was followed by a cheese course -- a lovely cow milk cheese with a tiny single slice of nut bread and an apple marmalade, served with a lovely Madeira. Last was a chocolate hazelnut praline dessert, paired with a lackluster Fonseca ruby port.I must report that we were less than impressed with our waiter. Every dish was served with a somewhat condescending explanation (e.g. This is hamachi, a white fish also called amberjack -- it is a very nice fish.) He was perfectly competent, but barely present -- we certainly did not feel special, and there was no recognition that it was our anniversary. The only time I actually felt that he was paying attention was when a bug crawled across the table in front of Martin -- he brushed it away quickly, and for the next wine course he gave Martin a little extra pour. Whoo hoo.In the end, we concluded that the food was good, some of it very good. But the price was high, and we didn feel that we had had a special evening. By far, the tasting menu at Komi was of higher quality, more fun, and a better value. No reason to come back here., Any restaurant that has a strictly reinforced dress code policy is off the bat too pretentious for my taste. Not that I have encountered a problem with it, but it seems to be the only thing people are concerned enough to talk to me about when I inform them that I was going to be dining here. Damn it people, who cares what Im wearing, I want to know what I should eat!The whole dress code thing seems like a big selling point for people. While that doesnt surprise me for a place like Georgetown, I dont live a shallow enough existence to feel the need to gain entrance to a fabulous meal by what I decide to wear on a particular night. Especially when the people judging my outfit and the outfits of people around me are the wait staff. First impression; Stuffy. While Ill work on my lexicon there really isnt another word I can think of that better describes how I felt when I was in this place. The decor and atmosphere made me feel like I was in an old country club and everyone in it was 50 plus years old and whos ancestors came on the May Flower. The air was thick and just everything about the interior screamed antique shop, even the dining tables are placed so closely I felt like I was actually antiquing walking through the place. My infant human eye is not capable of digesting so much old school when Im trying to enjoy a dinner. Yes, yes. I am aware that this place is called 1789, and boy they werent kidding. After that to be honest I really cant remember much about the food. The whole vibe of this place rubbed me in such a wrong way I couldnt enjoy much of the exorbitantly priced food. Although Im sure If I tasted something rave worthy I would remember it to write about it here. So Ive decided the actual food part of the evening was nothing more of average. Anyways, one thing was for sure; just because you get 4 different forks for a meal it doesnt change the quality of the food itself. Its just fluff; there to create an image of sophistication. Use it outside-in, you dumbass. Its just a glorified concept of using a clean utensil for each course. Final diagnoses; If you felt like spending twice or more on the price for the same caliber food (read: pedestrian, so-so, meh.) you can easily get elsewhere just so you can feel a blast from the past (or some of you who say its extravagance!), then this is the place to go., Im glad Yelp is starting to become popular in the DC area because thats where Im from. I came back from a visit and my friends took me here for a late birthday celebration. I literally came directly from the airport and the restaurant was very understanding about our lateness and we were even the last party left. I didnt feel rushed at all and even felt welcome to have a dessert. I of course wanted all 3 courses but limited myself to 2. The appetizers and main course were all a bit above average but nothing mind blowing. Favorite was the dessert where I got the chocolate coffee glass. Basically a mixture of chocolate and coffee mouse and pure heaven. Id come here for another special occasion, loved the free valet. Super convenient if youre dining in the city. And loads of bars to go out to afterwards as well., We always love, love love 1789. But we went with another couple for dinner on a Thursday night last week. Everything is as is always it...but one thing? The portions are very small...smaller than Marcels??The rack of lamb only had TWO ribs as before they had 3-4.I will not return, as two of us were hungrymafter we left?Try the Prim Rib for better food and surroundings., My wife and I went here for our first wedding aniversary and made reservation on open table explaining this and that we would like a quite romantic table. We got seated in a table for 4 in the center of a very noisy restraunt. The wait staf was very good, but out waiter was slow and unatttentive. The food was good and the price was excelent due to a fixed price coupon available online., When my boyfriend told me he was taking me to the jackets required 1789 restaurant for my birthday dinner, I immediately started brainstorming my outfit in my head, ready for a fancy night out. In my black dress, heels, and tennis bracelet I was feeling quite hoity-toity and loving it. When our cab pulled up to the restaurant the valets came over to open the door and help us out, the beginning of continually superb customer service throughout the night. We received a warm greeting from the hostess as she sat us at our table in the cozy Federal-era decorated dining room. Our waiter, alerted ahead of time that it was my birthday, presented me with a personalized menu to take home and even got the chef to sign it. We began with a bottle of wine, around $40, and one of several less expensive options. From other reviews I had expected some insane wine prices but they really weren that bad. You could also pay a $20 corking fee and bring your own bottle.For my first course, I had a pasta dish with saut39ed mushrooms and lima beans. It was a little too heavy on the butter for me and I wasn a sold on the lima beans but the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the large slices of mushroom were a good addition to the dish. My SO had the clams with bruchetta which I really liked. For the main course I had the rockfish, served with mushrooms and calamari. It was another dish with maybe too much butter but it was still very good and I loved the calamari with the fish. My SO had the black cod, served with mini potato cakes and chorizo. It was a bit heavier than your typical fish dish due to the chorizo, which also added a lot of flavor. Moving on to dessert, I had a delicious strawberry shortcake (complete with birthday candle and happy birthday fondant pieces) and my SO had the incredibly rich chocolate dome. All in all, the above and beyond service, romantic and cozy atmosphere, and delicious food made for a wonderfully memorable evening, the perfect way to celebrate my 24th :)On a side note, 1789 is currently running their special summer 3-course meal for $37 which is the perfect way to enjoy their food without losing all the contents of your wallet!, My husband and I booked a reservation here for a Saturday evening. Upon arrival we were seated quickly in the Carroll Room. We took part in their summer special -- 3 courses for $37 per person. I ordered an appetizer of Manila Clams (mussels and clams) and my husband orderd the Scallops. While we were waiting, we were served some great bread. The clams were very tasty and I found it to be the perfect size for an appetizer. The scallops on the other hand was a tiny dish... only 3 scallops. For the main course I ordered the Butter Poached Lobster and he got the New York Sirloin. These two entrees were an additional $15 on top of the $37 for the three course. The lobster was very tasty... it came with a thai chili sauce on one side and a honey sauce on the other so it was the perfect mix of spicy and sweet. The sirloin was also very good, it came with a spinach pie and some amazing onion rings. For dessert I got the Chocolate Dome and he got the Blackberry Tart. The Chocolate Dome was very rich and chocolately. It was flourless so it was quite thick. It came with a scoop of espresso ice cream. The Blackberry tart was amazing, the perfect summer dessert.After the meal, the waiter brought over little shortbread cookies which were nice. We were totally stuffed though! The waitstaff was very attentive. Overall, a great experience and wonderful meal. Quite expensive though! $140 total and we didn order and alcoholic beverages., I was pretty nervous about trying this place based on the wide range of reviews but my boyfriend really wanted to come here to celebrate our two years of togetherness. We got a 6 PM reservation (their first seating!) since I keep pretty early hours due to my mean old job. We got there a bit early and the waiters were still attending menu class but they let us into the side room to get a few drinks. If you want to have a quieter meal you will probably want an earlier seating since by the time we left it was getting pretty loud.We were seated a few minutes after 6 and decided to take partial advantage of their summer special three course menu. My boyfriend ordered a salad, veal, and some sorbet for dessert, while I ordered the NY strip. The amuse bouche for the evening was fantastic! It was a fried oyster served with a remoulade. I would have been quite happy with a whole plate of them! I forget what the salad we ordered was called but it was our least favorite part of the meal. It had a nice dressing on the side complete with capers and ham, but the lettuce was a little over acidic since it had been doused with quite a bit of lemon. The veal dish was delicious and came with some perfectly seasoned spinach and potatoes. My NY strip was excellent, cooked to a perfect medium, and came with sting thing onion rings and an awesome spinach custard (I didn get much of my spinach, my bf loved it so much he kept stealing it). We ended up choosing passion fruit sorbet and it came with three little cookies. They brought out some additional cookies courtesy of the chef to have with our coffee.As far as portion size, the NY strip is HUGE, but the other dishes didn look quite as filling. We both definitely left full but not overly stuffed. Service was wonderful the whole evening, very friendly and attentive. I managed to lose an earring towards the beginning of the night and the hostesses offered to help me look around the bar and outside for it. We didn recover it but they took down my information and promised to call if it was located. It was a really cheap earring and not a big deal but it was nice of them to go to all the trouble. $120 (tax included but not tip) for two entrees, one salad, one dessert, a glass of wine, some scotch, some coffee and some grappa wasn too bad for a nice evening out., Highly recommended for special occasions with a loved one. Also they have an excellent special that seems to run every summer in July and August where you can have three courses (including their yummy desserts) for $37. For this you can order anything from either the Firsts or Seconds, one Entree and one dessert. Some of the entrees incurred a $15 upcharge, but there was still a lot to choose from. The waiter constantly called my wife Madame. That all I think I need to say about the service. I did feel they could have used some more wine choices at the lower end of the scale. The majority seemed to be in the $60-90 range, with quite a few in the hundreds and only a handful in the $35-50 range. The menu does change frequently. I had a salmon plate with perfectly medium rare salmon on one side and raw salmon on the other side. The cooked salmon was on a bed of kale and mushrooms, very nice. The cavatelli second was also mind numbingly good. Topped off with Cherry Apricot Crumble and Vanilla Ice Cream and my wife Chocolate Dome, it was quite a perfect evening. My only very small criticism would be the decor seems a little dated, but maybe would feel cozier on a cold night as opposed to a steamy July night. Also be prepared to be here for a while. They are not rushed. It is clear here that the dinner is the main event., I am a huge 1789 fan, there is just something special, romantic, formal about the place and its atmosphere that I cant help but enjoy myself. This intimate setting is ideal for a romantic dinner or celebration. Every summer they offer a great deal, something like $33 for three courses, it generally runs all summer long and can be printed off of their website. Even without the $33 deal this place is a fantastic bet, the food, which resides on an ever evolving menu is always top notch and I have never been let down. When in season, the bread pudding is true heaven, as is the Colorado lamb., So the chef has changed again. Nathan Beauchamp left and now its Daniel Giusti, some guy from Las Vegas. Itll be interesting to see if he can revive Ris magic., Im still wondering what all the fuss is about. The atmosphere was nice, but it was a little too themed out for me. I kind of felt like I was at Disney World. The service was excellent. The food--not so much. I ordered the bib salad, the New York strip and the shortcake dessert and a couple of glasses of wine.Both the salad and dessert were good, but nothing to write home about. The steak was horrific. It was very fatty and tough. I ordered it cooked medium, but 3/4 of the steak was cooked well done. My boyfriend and I took advantage of their summer special (three courses for 37ish bucks). Note that there is a $15.00 up charge if you order beef. Clearly its not worth the 15 bucks., OK, this place would have gotten a sold 5 stars if it wasnt for the decor which seemed to be the original since inception. Very old, old, school.On to the food. Our original plan was to take advantage of the summer special. But after the waiter informed us that was a $15 upcharge on certain selections, we just ordered off the menu.We skipped a 1st course, but the waiter presented us with a cold yellow tomato puree soup. Im not a fan of cold soups and The Man isnt a fan of tomatoes, so neither of us tried it. For our main course we had the strip steak w/spinach and onion rings. Cooked to perfection, medium well, still juicy on the inside and a bit of a char on the outside. Just the way we like it. Served with a wine reduction sauce. The spinach was creamy, but not gooey, a little bland but nothing that a little salt and pepper couldnt make right. The onion rings were sooooo good. I was tempted to ask for seconds!No desert for us. But the selections looked scrumptious. However, the waiter gave us some mini shortbread cookies, very delicious!From the moment we walked in our hostess was gracious, seating us quickly even though we were about 20 minutes late. The waiter wasnt very attentive, but he was pleasant.We will return!, I decided to take my mom to a new place (new to her) for her birthday. Her birthday falls during the last week of the Summer Special so I decided to take advantage of it. I absentmindedly forgot to make reservations but they were still able to seat us in less than 15 minutes.We were seated upstairs which is a way small space with about 8 tables. Its cozy and all but if one is prone to claustrophobia ask top be seated elsewhere.The food was pretty good. I started off with a really good crab soup. It was so delicious that I had to discreetly use the bread to sop up the bit I couldnt get with a spoon. Dinner consisted of huge grilled shrimp. They were also very tasty. The best part of the meal was Upside-Down Caramel Peach Tart. The only drawback is it needs to come with two servings because one is not enough.Edited to give info about the summer special:For $39 you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert. All they ask is that you sign up on the site (newsletter and offers from the restaurant) and they give you a pdf to print out and bring in to present to your waiter. I believe theyve done it at least two years in a row and it ran until the second week of Sept., This was an exceptional and very memorable dining experience, the best we had in Washington, DC. and definitely worth the price. We had rack of lamb with pierogi and braised fennel and red grouper with garbanzo bean puree, cherry tomato confit, and pickled onions and both dishes were sensational. The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was charming. This is the perfect spot to celebrate a special occasion. We definitely will return the next time were in town., One of my favorite DC restaurants. I love the historical surroundings, too.The roasted chicken is always great. The duck confit was excellent, and the lobster was succulent., Old school, pretentious, stodgy-to-boring DC isnt generally my favorite, but I make an exception for 1789. This is a place of no surprises - they have a mission, they execute it essentially without flaw - you leave with the satisfied feeling of having just experienced, not something mind-blowing, but reliable excellence. go, appreciate the food, service, and setting, and notice the details, because they do.Its a great place for the holidays in particular - christmas carolers, very festive, etc., I had dinner here during Restaurant Week sometime around 2004. I was really looking forward to it, especially since the restaurant had such a high reputation. But I was very disappointed. Not only was the decor sparse and almost shabby in the upstairs dining room where we were seated, the food was mediocre, and the service was even worse. It was impossible to flag down a waiter. The service aside, I got the impression that the restaurant merely serves typical foods to a regular audience... I couldnt fathom how the food could be considered anything above average., Hosted about 50 peeps in one of the private dining rooms. All around service, food, price, drinks, desserts and again, SERVICE made this a 5 star for me. They had assigned about 3-4 workers for our party. During the planning, the coordinator was very flexible in my needs and was very easy going - constant communication was not a problem for them.If youre looking to host a small group, check this place out., This is the restaurant you come to for atmosphere, history, and a sense of the power meetings going on that shaped our country in this very restaurant. It was also where I first tasted Dom Perignon champagne, so its a pleasant memory for me. I would come here for drinks, and perhaps a serious dinner. The Rack of Lamb is perfection personified here. Very expensive here., We held our rehearsal dinner at 1789. The food and ambiance were fantastic. They did a great job with the decor. I rate them 3 stars because they put us in a room that wasnt really big enough for the size of our group, which made it hard to socialize and slowed down the service quite a bit., INCREDIBLE.My girlfriend and I got the scallops and steak tar tare appetizers (sounds scary, but please try it), and the rock fish main course.Heres a tip: Go during any restaurant week (The next one being February 16-March 1). They offer a 3 course menu for $35. Thats a steal., A DEFINITE MUST! This place is amazing on all facets; service, food, wine and atmosphere. If you live in DC or are visiting and need a place for a very nice dinner, this is the place to be and the place to be seen., A friend of a friend recently treated a group of us to a meal at 1789. Wow. This restaurant is easily the best Ive been to in DC. Sure, you have to throw on a jacket and shine the old loafers, but the food is more than worth the hassle of dressing up. I opted for the 3-course set meal for $40 (snail and broccoli soup, a nice clean fish dish, and flan). To complement the meal, we had a nice chianti, and B&Bs to finish things off. The waitstaff was non-intrusive, and very generous in allowing us to stay well after closing time in order to savor the experience., My boyfriend and I dined here for Restaurant Week last night, and we were both extremely disappointed. I ordered the Broccoli and Snails Soup as my appetizer. The burgundy snails were perfect, but the broccoli aspect of the soup was completely bland. The restaurant skimped on the cheese, so most of the soup ended up tasting as though broccoli had been thrown in a blender and put into a bowl. My boyfriend began with the pasta. The mushrooms gave it a nice earthy flavor, and it was well-balanced and not too oily. I had the hanger steak as an entree. It was brutally seared on the outside, and as you can imagine completely raw on the inside. I would have sent it back, but it took almost an hour for our entrees to arrive after we finished our appetizers. The collard greens earned a 5 star. They were phenomenal. The cauliflower gratin arrived in a small frying pan and, to be honest, I couldve made it myself. My boyfriend had the same problem. He ordered the pork chop, which was burned on the outside as well. His vegetables were perfect, but it was difficult to taste anything besides burnt meat.I was most excited about the dessert course due to the arrival of the new pasty chef. The chocolate/cherry cake was good, although the texture was off. The apple strudel was so disappointing, we both joked that an apple pie from McDonalds wouldve tasted better.Im sure 1789 was busy because its Restaurant Week, but the lack of attention paid to my meal really turned me off. They neglected simple details a home-cook would have noticed. Sadly, theyve missed their chance to make me a repeat diner., Companion(s): 1 friendOccasion: Restaurant WeekLocated in a historic building, we entered a charmingly-cramped lobby lined with dark, heavy beams, and were greeted immediately. Up an even more cramped set of stairs -- the word quaint comes to mind -- we were seated within 5 minutes upon arrive. The dinning room felt both homey and low-key romantic.Needless to say, the service was great. Polite yet friendly, we were never neglected nor harried onto the next course. Everything flowed naturally from ordering onwards, one course to the next.I ordered from the prix-fixe menu:* Mushroom Peppardelle* Pork Chop -- infused with flavor and not too dry -- I was not disappointed, but not wowed either* Chocolate Cherry Cake -- good, but nothing special* Apple Strudel -- creamy, crunchy shell; apple filling just sweet enough -- HIGHLY recommendedThe food was well-made, fresh ingredients, and comforted more than tantalized or astonished me (this may be because I typically go for more exotic fare). Nevertheless, a good experience all around.food: 3.5atmosphere: 4service: 5, RW review only:First and foremost, the alleged best item on the list (the rack of lamb) is not on their RW menu. I would like to come back to try it because it appears to get the most positive press. If it is indeed amazing, I would strongly suggest this place as a special occasion dinner because this restaurant is very well run.As far as how it presents for RW, I was a bit disappointed overall with the food. The problem was that I wasnt really blown away by any of the items I sampled. As one of the other posters noted, the snails in the brocolli snail soup were flavorful, but the base was mostly a green mess. I dont know if they were trying to make broccoli veloute, but it didnt work. The cheese that sparsely populated the soup was exquisite, and I think it would have been significantly tastier if it was more prominent. Unfortunately, it was a mere accent. I did enjoy the branzino, but it was a trifle on the small size. Yet, the presentation and pairing with perfectly done potato was fine. I would certainly suggest it as the RW choice. The dessert was unremarkable. The restaurant did give an interesting amuse bouche as well as some tiny hazlenut flavored chocolates at the end of the meal. Other points: Our servers were excellent. The coat girl was beautiful. The hostess was friendly. The wine that we chose (Argentinian Malbec because all my dining companions ordered the hanger steak) was stellar. This is a romantic restaurant; it is fine for a second or third date. If you are taking your girlfriend or wife, they will likely appreciate the romantic ambiance. I will hold off on recommending for a business dinner until I try that rack of lambs., Katies Restaurant Week Winter 2009 Report CardDining Companion(s): Alicia C, Cadence R.1st Course: Lobster Papperadelle. 4 surprisingly large pieces of lobster with two fresh tasty pieces of pasta. A really nice buttery/Meyer Lemon sauce. (1st courses are usually 11-16 dollars)2nd Course: Pork Chop, with Jerusalem artichoke mash, onions, mushrooms, and snails (which Ill be the first to admit I didnt eat). Pork was nice and moist. A good dish and plenty of meat, but there could have been more mash in my opinion. (Usually 32 dollars on its own) Dessert: Cranberry-Tangerine Bomb. Actually pretty good, and nice presentation. Two little meringue sticks covered in pistachio were a really nice treat on top. (Usually 9 dollars)Service: Eh. Our main server could have been a bit warmer, but the food runners were nice. Valet was cute and nice.Atmosphere: Old school. We were taking upstairs to a nice wood paneled room. There were some interesting antique prints by our table---one particularly funny one of a guy with a devil head that served as interesting conversation fodder. If you dont like looking at a stuffed version of your food while you eat, maybe this room isnt for you. Extras: -Loft of crusty bread and butter that helped displace the skimpiness of other portions. -An amuse bouche was served before the meal---but it did not accomplish the task of exciting me before the meal. It was a tiny crostini with Spanish ham and fennel on top. Not original, not exciting, not vastly different than the mini-toasts and prosciutto that I eat in my kitchen all the time. Dont do an amuse bouche just because you can---Chef Giusti, please next time amuse me. -Little pieces of hazelnut fudge with the bill. -Complimentary valet parking.Value: 50+ dollar meal for 35.09, Overall I would give more than 3 stars---maybe like a 3.509 since it cost that much., ** 3.5 Stars ** Restaurant Week experience **You can usually judge a restaurant accurately when youe only see them for RW, but in this case, I think I won be too far off. The $35, 3-course RW menu is the same as their new promotional $40 prix-fixe menu that offered on weekdays before 6:45 - a fantastic value. So this means that we were ordering food pretty much from their regular menu.APPETIZERS: The broccoli and snail soup sounded delicious, but the whole thing overall was forgettable. The four small pieces of battered and fried snail were flavorful and juicy, but the taste of the soup itself was pretty shallow -- It like it couldn decide if it wanted to be creamy or not. Her mushroom pasta was pretty awesome - big fat chow-fun-like noodles. I only had a little taste, but it was pretty good.ENTREE: The pork chop dish didn look impressive (it took up about 1/3 of the plate), but it was pretty hefty. I guess it snail season because there were more snails mixed in with the veggies underneath the pork. Not bad. Her branzino (I never heard of this fish before!) was better. It was really juicy and perfectly cooked. We both decided not to get the hanger steak because of one word: Ray. :)DESSERT: We had a lot of fun of referring to her citrus bombe dessert. :) It was shaped like a scoop of sorbet with some interesting garnishes. As for the taste, she described it this way: You can almost taste the cinnamon, but just when you think you do, it takes you all the way around and then hits you with CITRUS! (Did I get that right, Jenny?) The waiter suggested the apple strudel over the chocolate tart, and it was pretty good. Light, flaky pastry surrounding some rich apples and a fun-flavored ice cream on the side. SERVICE: The staff we interacted with were very competent and professional, but definitely not the best in town. Overall, it was a great meal, but there wasn anything about this restaurant that made me say, Ooooh! Excuse my limited vocabulary., I must agree with the last person who went for restaurant week. If I was rating this place on the food alone, I would have only given it three (or maybe even two and a half) stars. Sure, the food wasnt bad, but at this type of place, I expect nothing less than excellent. I had the mushroom papardelle, which was very good, though slightly heavy handed on the salt. I love mushrooms, and I also felt that the pasta somewhat masked the little mushrooms. My friend had the snail and broccoli soup, which was excellent. The entrees were a bit disappointing. I had the steak, and I am quite annoyed that the under $20 steak I had at Clydes, which is under the same ownership, was much much better. The flavor was okay, but it was the chewiest steak I have had in a while, and it took a considerable amount of effort to chew it in a manner befitting such a formal setting. The cauliflower au gratin that came with it was good, but not remarkable. I had a bite of my friends fish, which was quite good, and I wish I had ordered that instead of the steak. Dessert was good, but again, not remarkable. I also must agree with everyone about the service. That is the only reason why I gave this place four stars has some of the best service in the city. Not only was the staff professional and knowledgeable, but they were also NICE. I arrived about 45 minutes early for my reservations (I was coming from work), and everyone from the valet attendant (I did not have a car) to the coat check to the bar tender was very friendly and helpful. I sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender, who told me about a few of the dishes. When I had to use the ladies room, the waitress showed me how to get to it (its a bit complicated). Also, I went with a friend who is a gluten-free vegetarian, and they were quite accommodating. They made sure to let her know what options were available, and adjusted things as necessary to make them gluten free. Also, now they have a $40 prix-fix menu every night!, WOW!! This place was awesome... and thank God it was restaurant week or my husband and I would have never been able to afford to eat as much as we did!!Everything about our experience was a delight! The service is out of this world... and the ambiance was wonderful. The only thing that is holding this place back from the full 5 stars was the food. I loved my appetizer (lobster papperdelle) and the dessert was soooo good (apple strudel) but the main course was just so-so! I ordered the fish off of the restaurant week menu and was just under impressed. It was ok... just not that great.I think my favorite thing I ate that night was this little surprise that came out after dessert... it was a little bit of truffle/fudge with hazelnuts on top. Holy nuts... it was like a tiny little orgasm for my mouth!!I probably will never go back... but I totally would if I could afford it!, I found this place merely average, but Katie F. detailed the reasons why better than I ever will. Please see her review., I came for restaurant week since Ive heard a lot of great things about this place and couldnt wait to try it out!! The service was definitely top notch ant the atmosphere was whimsical. Some of the reviewers didnt seem to enjoy their meals as much as I did, but I had a very good meal. No, its true I wasnt blown away by anything but I thoroughly enjoyed everything. One thing I wish I wouldve done was come at another time. They have the same prefix menu for only $5 as a regular part of their menu.From the paparedelle to the broccoli and snail soup, we were pleased but now wowed. Our entrees were the rockfish and the Steak. Our steak was also a bit burnt on the outside. It wasnt horribly charred but I wouldnt have expected that from such a restaurant. My rockfish on the other hand was delicious! The mushrooms and smoked trout roe were really great touches to the fish.Our desserts were good, I particularly enjoyed my bombe which the waiter suggested; it was incredibly refreshing.All in all everything was enjoyable but not very memorable. I dont think Ill be back anytime too soon., Aaaahhh.....1789. You were the backdrop for one of my favorite dining nights evah. A friend and I had dinner here on a Tuesday during restaurant week. We started the night early--6:00pm--which happens to be when the restaurant opens. The good thing about arriving early is that there are likely to be parking spots open nearby. We snagged one across the street. We walked in and were promptly welcomed by a pleasant young woman who informed us that we could sit and relax in the bar while the restaurant was putting their final touches on opening for dinner (we walked in early around 5:50). I started with a *stiff* drink of water with lemon. Not long after Id taken a sip and tried a smoked almond, we were called to be seated. We were seated in a corner booth on the ground level, where the lighting was low and the atmosphere intimate. We were presented with the regular menu and the RW menu. I elected to go with the RW menu, and my friend chose one thing from the RW menu and an entree from the regular menu. Yeah, you can mix it up like that. The restaurant aims to please. We were presented with an offering of amuse bouche. I dont know what it was other than tuna and a hint of green onion. It was an amazing flavor--it was like a big POP in the mouth of complex flavors. I wish I had been paying more attention as to what our server said it was, but it was wonderful. We both wanted to start with the wild mushroom papperadalle. It was a nice combination, but my friend (aspiring food critic that he is) mentioned that you had to have the two things together in order to have a successful combination; you couldnt just have a bite of the mushroom or the pasta to appreciate the dish (Ill have him Yelping in no time....). I, on the recommendation of our server Jose, chose the pork chop. My date ordered the venison from the regular menu. While my dinner didnt blow me away, I did enjoy it and thought it was very good. My dining companion, on the other hand, was *totally* blown away by his roasted loin of venison and loved, loved, loved it. My dish was accompanied by Jerusalem artichoke puree, roasted fennel, hedgehog mushrooms and Burgundy snails. I wouldve liked a slightly larger serving to balance out the portion of the pork, but I still enjoyed it very much. His dish was accompanied by roasted sweet potatoes, stewed mustard greens, and mole poblano. He gave me a bite and I have to say it was flawless. Next up: dessert. I chose the cherry chocolate cake (we decided to share it), but Jose, *awsome* server that he is, brought us the apple strudel on the house. On the house? Damn. He must have liked us! The apple strudel was tasty and not too or overly sweet, but that cake killed it. Visions were in our head and they were not of sugarplums. Gawd. Very, very good service. Wonderful meal. Yep. FIVE stars., Ive been here twice now for dinner in the last year, and both nights were perfect in just about every way. Most recently, I came here for dinner during Restaurant Week. I had read some mixed reviews about other peoples experiences during RW, but honestly, we couldnt find a thing to complain about! I was originally planning on taking advantage of the RW menu, but I couldnt pass up their specialty rack of lamb, which I still vividly remembered from my first dinner here last summer. The lamb was every bit as tender and delicious and perfectly cooked as the first time I had it. My dining companion went for the $35 RW dinner menu (similar, if not the same, as the new $40 prix-fixe menu that you can get anytime). She ordered the broccoli and snail soup for her first course - this was surprisingly tasty! I loved the lightness of the (vibrantly green) soup and the delicate crust on the tiny fried snails. She had the hanger steak for her main course, which I must say gave the lamb a run for its money. Cooked perfectly between rare & medium-rare (cooked through, but *just* so, which is how I think quality beef should be done!), it left all the hearty flavor in the meat and kept it nice and tender. It was served over a bed of greens (swiss chard, I think? or possibly beet greens?) that really complemented the meat, as well as a side of cauliflower gratin (extra cheesy, just the way I like it! MMM!).For dessert, we were just going to split the apple strudel that came with the RW menu, but the server couldnt serve one of us without the other having something - so I got a beautifully plated Cranberry-Tangerine Bombe on the house! In addition to being fun to say, it was just plain delicious. And Im not really a fruity sorbet kinda person, but I ate the whole damn thing, crisp pistachio meringue included.The service was impeccable. Friendly and attentive without being overbearing, helpful in explaining menu options, and obviously doing everything they could to make sure our experience was memorable. Excellent wine menu features mainly French wines but also offers a nice selection of domestic options and a few South American choices. The fresh bread is crusty but with plenty of soft, fluffy insides to slather with the salted butter..... okay, I admit it, they had me with the bread and butter. The delicious entrees and free dessert were just icing on the cake. =)Note that jackets are required for men. Complimentary valet parking is available, but Ive been able to find parking within a block of the restaurant on both Saturday nights that Ive gone, once at 6:30pm and again at 7:45pm. I loved the design of the restaurant, which is housed in an old townhouse that retains its cozy feel, with original room partitions and fireplaces. We also remarked upon the fact that each table in the Middleburg room where we sat was decorated with a real, wax-dripping taper candle in a silver candlestick - a classy touch that I cant remember finding elsewhere in a long time! Sometimes, simple IS good., Jason and I went there during restaurant week. You know it was a good start when the valet parking was free, the hostess was very welcoming and the waiter was such a wise looking cute old man. The ambient was filled with upscale colonial decoration, giving you a very warm, homy feeling. The chef first presented an amuse-bouche: duck liver pate with macerated cherry on a toast crisp. For our first course, Jason got the broccoli and snails soup, the soup was very rich almost tasted a little chessy, with beer battered burgundy snails, was delicious. I got the bitter greens and citrus salad with blood orange, mandarine orange and grapefruit slices, very clean and crisp and citrusy. For the entree, Jason got the pork chop served on artichoke puree. The pork chop was juicy and grilled just right, although with only sauteed onions on the side, it could have used another veggie, like mashed potatoes or asparagus. The atlantic cod I got was crispy on the outside and served with some mashed potato, it was nothing too extraordinary. The desserts were delicious. Jason got the chocolate ice cream with cherry glace, and I got the cranberr-tangerine ice cream, very unique, presented beautifully and tasted delicious. Since my cod was not really in their regular menu, I wont judge against the rating system, but for everything else, the place is definitely recommended., Wow!My mom is coming to town this weekend and I wanted to treat her to special meal, but given last weeks issues with salt and undercooked steak, I thought Id send them a note. I know I wasnt the only one that encountered problems and I thought maybe they had some staffing issues in the kitchen--who knows, cant a girl be curious? EDITED: I finally did get a response, though not a helpful one: Below is the gist of the email to 1789 and the response. See that drain over there? My fav restaurant just went down it. :(Im writing because 1789, until this week, was my favorite restaurant in all of DC. I know that many DC Metro-ers view your restaurant as a premier eating establishment and it is one of our favorite special occasion places to go. I particularly requested to go for my birthday dinner this week. Are you familiar with the Yelp community and do you read the reviews of your restaurant on it? Please check out the reviews for 1789 as soon as possible and sort them by date. This years restaurant week reviews are not helping your amazing rating--in fact, youre doing very poorly and I hope you will take the time to correct some of the bad experiences many people are having this week--undercooked steak and very salty pappardelle are two of the biggest issues.I hope that you will fix some of the problems in the kitchen--as it seems I was not the only patron disappointed this week--so that you will continue to be a local favorite for years to come.Candace C.Dear Ms. C.Thank you for taking the time to email us. I am sorry to hear you had a disappointing evening with us. If you could please give specific problems from your dinner, I will certainly look into it and discuss it with the rest of our staff.Thank you,MQ
1|2020-restaurant-and-lounge-washington|This is a great venue for groups or to just come have a well mixed drink. I highly recommend you come and enjoy the food, drinks, and frivolity. Von was on point as a bartender, and the video music was on point and selectable thru an app., This place just opened up, and it rocks! There are three floors inside--disco downstairs, bar on 1st floor, and VIP lounge on top. John is the man! Not only is he gonna fix a badass mezcal concoction for you, hes gonna make one for himself and come from behind the counter and share it with you (if not busy, of course). Its definitely more upscale than Bras Monkey, Roxanne, and most other places on 18th, so dont expect them to have Bud on tap. Overall easy 5 stars; will come back and bring friends., Get the Von shot aka no-name shot aka the thundercat. Don ask why. Just trust me. Holla at Von. Our bartender who has 99 other drinks to make so getting your drank on ain one., Great service. I like the 3 level design! Every level is different which is great depending on what you want to do that night.Downstairs - if youd like to dance the night away, you can have your favorite drink & dance on the dance floor. The Dj there that night was pretty good. He had a pretty good mix, I like how he threw in old school music as well.Second floor(mid-floor) - if youre looking to kick back with your date, have some food & drink but still keeping it classy. Then you should head there!3rd level - If youre up for the VIP status! Which is on the right level in my opinion!, One week in and this establishment will need to improve on their food if they are to become the next hot stop in one of D.C.s hottest hang out spots Adams Morgan. The positives:1. Good, professional ownership.2. Very good wait staff.3. If you go ask for Carl, hes a good server.4. Nice atmosphere.5. Sit by window for good people watching.6. Good location.The negatives:1. Food was not seasoned well.2. The portion size was somewhat insulting.3. We had a party of four and we were all happy about our drinks...the chef didnt make the beer from tap.4. Never insult your clients with misleading names on the menu; example: Dont call it Lumpia when its really Tempura.Thats an insult to anyone who enjoys Filipino food.5. Dont do desert here. If you want what they have go to your local grocery store.Note:For the record my wife enjoyed your take on Tatar Tots. Thats a positive.Overall for foodies who love to eat all over the world this was disappointing. However in a few months (if youre still around) we may try it again. The positive is there is room for improvement, the negative is well read above., Love this place. Very Euro..great food and excellent bartenders. Great place to eat, or just gather with friends for a drink. Highly recommend it!, Whoever decides not to give this place the 5 stars it deserves, ignore them. This place is fun, energetic & alive. You can see the effort that went into the decor. Its beautiful. I loved the mood of the restaurant. It was vibrant. I am long out of the club scene but I still enjoy the energy of it. I felt very relaxed, like being in a restaurant surrounded by friends and family, not like being in a night club. So IMO this place reaches to not only the young clubbing crowd but also the older crowd whos not interested in sitting in a corner with a drink in one hand, fist pump in the other. Its for all ages and all social groups. I am not a big drinker so Voss sparkling water for me please, however my friend had a tequila margarita which was good but again, Im not big on alcohol. For her second drink she had the 2020 Cosmo. Now that was something I would order. It was fruity not over loaded with alcohol. On the rare occasion I do drink, I like to enjoy the drink, not try to chug it rather than fight the taste. I came with a group of friends for dinner. Mmm, mmm...lets talk about the food. In no way am I a food connoisseur. However I like what I like and will write this review based on my pallet. For appetizer we had pork belly tatter tots. They speak for them selves : ), now to my understanding this was considered a soft opening and the chef is playing around with different menu options. My dear chef, if you read this review...please keep the tatter tots...please. For the entree my friend enjoyed the salmon, which of course I tried and it was really good. It was cooked just right with the right amount of spices. Most places drown the fish in lemon juice but this was not the case at 2020. I devoured, yes devoured, my pot roast accompanied with mashed potatoes and veggies. I highly recommend it if you are lucky enough to see it on the menu. My boyfriend loves the chicken sandwich and yes, I tried that too ; ). Again, three snaps to the chef for not over cooking the chicken, it was just right and juicy. Again this is all my personal opinion. I have had different fare from all around the world and an eclectic pallet but I urge you to try for yourself. Now that Im stuffed, its time for dessert. Now what a pleasant way to end the evening. With a warm apple crumble, big chunks of Apple, the right amount of cinnamon, sugar and spices then topped with cold, gooy vanilla ice cream. I am looking forward to coming back soon and next time maybe even stay for the night scene : ), This place is a fresh breath of air in adams morgan! It comparable to the type of places you find on L Street and Dupont circle. The perfect combination of : attention and let me be. The lemon pepper wings are sooo awesome with the dry rub, and if youe looking for a great burger, the southern burger is a must. The staff is so friendly and awesome! Come check out their brunch on Saturday from 12-3! Bottomless mimosas will not disappoint! Come one come all! And whoever is doing the music, they need a contract!, I totally love this place. I can say thats the best place in Adams Morgan area.. Its new, clean and music its amazing. Stuff is very friendly and polite. My friends and I went to celebrate my two best friends wedding and it was amazing. Im so coming next time. An amazing place.! You guys should check it out!!, I came here for the every last Thursday of the month Throwback Thursday. They have open bar Belvedere and specials. The DJ is jamming to all the old school tunes from the 80s and early 90s, what I consider real music.The drinks are good and the food specials were good. The food also tasted good. Did I mention the throwback music. The party was on the main floor, but I waked around to see what the other space looked like, it a beautiful spot. Parking is terrible., Threw my luv a bday party here. The manager was the best! She accommodated is and helped make my baby am day extra special. She gave me 2 sections down stairs and allowed me to have unlimited guess on the condition that I purchased 2 bottles. & those bottles couldve been any price bottles of our choice. Of course we definitely spent well over $1500 but I loved how accommodating she was!!!!! The food was good...we ordered some things off the late menu...calamari, shrimp Caesar salad, wings...fruit plates...And not to mention the dj played all my songs I requested:))) Definitely a great time in my book!, A vibrant, high energy, plush, Asian flare of food & d39cor...one of the very few places on the strip that I can return to over & over. As soon as I waked in, I caught a corner table by the window, which there is 2 on opposite ends, & positioned myself to view the interior/exterior activities. The euro design & furniture was on a high mark, especially the long couches against the walls. My server/bartender was Mariah & she handled her bar patrons, her walk up patrons & her table patrons as in me, in nothing less than bar none super service. A constant smile with her non stop movement made it seem simple for her to serve everyone...she needs the ol fashion tip jar on her bar!The tri-level concept is perfect, if you dont feel the urge to be in hype/dancing mode where the DJ spins downstairs-with his amazing skills & music selection, you can enjoy from afar upstairs. The top level I presume is for the VIP & Special Events, as from what I could see, the circular windows & bar area was giving off a heavy white hue & exclusive vibe.What an amazing concept for the nightlife in the hardy party corridor of Adams Morgan in offering a new & unique concept to the massive other clubs/lounges...applauses to the Owners vision. For the food, another A+ for the tapas & fusion inspired-nosh hailing from 3 different menus. The ability to make reservations is plus, in addition to having a go to spot on a Thursday night that doesnt close until 2am., Ive been here on 2 separate occasions, both on Friday nights. This a review of the club downstairs. Ive never been to the restaurant before. PROS: - There is no cover charge ! - Pretty good music (not a lot of pop though)- 3 levels which is nice. Good amount of sitting space on 2nd and 3rd levelCONS: - The hookah was 47 dollars (yeah, you read right). Go to a hookah bar in Adams Morgan and THEN come here if you must. - The music was good (mostly hiphop, trap, r&b) but the DJ that night was HORRIBLE at transitioning from song to song. Not exaggerating. Everyone would pause dancing because we had no idea what was coming next. - If you get there after 12 am, prepare for a LONG wait in the line. The bouncers are pretty rude and will allow tons of other people to cut the line and dont balance out the flow of people they let it. This was particularly irritating because its a free cub, but they were treating it like a high demand VIP lounge. Ultimately --- this is a free lounge and Id recommend it if youre looking for cheap thrills. But dont expect an awesome club with excellent music and vibes. Otherwise, go party elsewhere., Absolute bait and switch dive bar. The sign claims five dollar drinks. The check comes out to 9 dollars a drink. Though the manager offers a free round, it doesnt cover up their lies., Went here to celebrate my wifes birthday. Sae greeted us at the door and was very friendly. Made me feel like a VIP. Had a table for us reserved on the main level. Food was fantastic. We ordered sushi and some in our party had the wings. No complaints. I never had to ask for another drink. The wait staff was on top of their game. After dinner and drinks Sae moved our party to the VIP level for Karaoke. Everyone had a blast!Thanks for making my wifes birthday special. Rodney
2|acadiana-washington|Located near the Convention Center - I attended a banquet dinner in their cozy banquet room. Everyone loved the food and when asking for something from the wait staff they will respond with It will be my pleasure - now how is that for respect! Made me feel like a princess!! ahahahahaha, Wow. Yum. I repeat. Wow. Yum. Acadiana is great = New Orleans food done right. That said, I dont love the dining room -- a bit hotel-y looking to me but thats kinda par for the course in DC. But the meal? Wow. Yum. The tomato torte was fantastic, the shrimp and grits were out of this freakin world tasty, the gumbo was expectedly fine, the etouffe maybe a bit too saucy but the service and the ever-flowing real deal sweet tea were outstanding. (And yeah I went for restaurant week and that impresses me all the more bc the place was packed and yet the food was the best $20 meal Ive had maybe ever...), I was tremendously disappointed in the food at Acadiana, but it may be due to all the hype there was surrounding this establishment before I checked it out for myself. If you ask me, all the hype was just a bunch of hullabaloo!! Its mediocre at best. I may be in the minority here, but Im sticking to my guns. For some real fine dining, go for a stroll towards Gallery Place and try Indeblue or Zengo., Honey, the food at Acadiana is so good youl want to slap yomomma!!Step through the unassuming glass doors at the corner of 9th and New York and be transported to an entirely different world. If you want to impress a date / friend / out of town-er / client / your parents (moms - consider yourselves duly warned), this would be the place to do it.Start your experience off with one of their signature cocktails. My favorite is the Category Five, their rendition of the Hurricane. The wine list demonstrates range and depth, and comes in a variety of budgets. There are some totally acceptable wines in the $30-40 range. You can also spend well into the hundreds.The gumbo is absolutely the best Ie ever tasted. Also of note on the starters list are the fried green tomatoes and the char grilled oysters. A friend of mine doesn like oysters as a rule, but I found myself slapping his hand away from my share of this garlic buttery-goodness. Follow your tastes and interests here and you can go wrong. Every dish is decidedly delicious.There nothing to avoid on the entree list either. Of note though is the duck breast (it apparently takes them 2 days to make it!), the grillades and grits (slap yo momma good!), and the grilled redfish. There are usually some outstanding specials as well. This past weekend they were offering a fish that had just been caught earlier that day in the Chesapeake. It doesn get much fresher than that.Desserts - anything that uses their special creole caramel. It very subtle, but they actually use tobasco and cayenne in its preparation. Add it to the bourbon pecan and chocolate chip tart, and it magic on a plate. Rinse (with a single malt scotch), repeat.The last thing I like to mention is the staff. We tend to accept bad service here in our fair capital. Acadiana servers are top notch. This is one of the transporting experiences of the restaurant. The staff is professional, attentive, and fun. Several regulars (including me) have personal favorites and request specific sections when making their reservations. I sure this is a headache for the maitre , but it is also testament to the remarkably great job they all do.Just...don sit next to your momma., To me, the thought of a Cajun gourmet restaurant is in itself an oxymoron. However, once I tried the fried green tomatoes, I was sold!The set up of the dining room is different. The dining room is very large, with an upper and lower level and the kitchen at mid level. Take a look at the huge Crystal chandeliers hanging from the ceiling and the wrought iron grill work throughout the place. Impressive.The oyster poboy (they call it Peacemaker) I had at Acadiana was so reminiscent of my trip to the Big Easy. And for dessert? A twist on pecan pie: a pecan tart served with chocolate ice cream drizzled with bourbon and caramel sauce. Heaven., I love me some shrimp and grits.Came to Acadiana for a business lunch and it was really great. Wonderful service and I loved the ambiance/decor. They serve wonderful fluffy biscuits instead of bread and they have SWEET TEA! Huge in my book (as a born and bred southerner!). Food was awesome... I strongly recommend the shrimp and grits and the pecan and chocolate chip tarte. Yummmmmmy., I think the food was OK--not great, but OK. I went with a date and shared plates and of the 5 or 6 different things I tasted, everything except the deviled eggs was bland. The food didnt have a lot of character. The Bananas Foster was good, but nothing special. Acadiana isnt expensive, but I still dont think its worth the price. The ambience is just OK. The service there was fantastic, though., Been three times. Each time, the food and service has been great.Attended a reception in the back room where the waiters brought around appetizers. Deviled eggs were great, but I dont know that they were great enough to have 3 for $7 with dinner.Turtle soup is among the best Ive had outside of New Orleans. Charbroiled oysters are also a necessity with dinner. BBQ shrimp was very good, but have had bigger shrimp in this dish in other restaurants. The free biscuits are also a favorite. Only dish I havent loved was the redfish which was done very plainly., SOOO MUCH POTENTIAL!The food was phenomenal. But god is this place ugly.The color palette reminds me of an office cubicle. I was there for restaurant week to visit a friend that works there and recommended it highly. The RW menu was great. Not simply a ploy to get you there and then serve you the lowest crap on the menu. Not only that, but the staff was fully capable of handling the large crowd.Even the iced tea was delicious. The steak and duck were perfection and monstrous portions. Extra Bleu cheese at no extra charge! The chocolate bread pudding was good, but honestly there arent many restaurants in DC with good desserts. So comparatively speaking it was one of the better desserts Ive had here.Sadly, this place is ugly. Seriously Ugly. Just looks like they went bargain basement on it. Literally. You are semi subterranean. The tables are WAY TOO CLOSE TOGETHER!Im pretty torn with whether or not I want to return. Please use some profits to spruce this place up a bit., I could make a meal out of the biscuits and fried tomatoes. With a milk punch and Pims of course. Delicious turtle soup that doesnt run on the gamy side, fried tomatoes that dont destroy the fresh flavors of the ingredients, and pies that are about as light and fluffy as you can get for this haute New Orleans cuisine. But why stop there? The main dishes are just as tasty, and doubly filling. The shrimp are outstanding, save for a little too much salt, but hey- its southern cooking and there are a few things that come with the territory. What a slice of southern life! Go enjoy some bourbon, a delicious meal, and a sweet dessert., Acadiana is a truly authentic New Orleans-style restaurant. Their blackened Tilapia was terrific. If you are not into shellfish or sausage, the menu can be a bit limiting. Also, ask for regular coffee, otherwise you will get the chicory coffee and be in for a surprise.This restaurant has a good ambiance and meets my needs for a business lunch. I will add this to the list of restaurants to go with clients, but not too often., If its a nice night, grab a table outside. Its much better than the bland dining room, which - truth be told - smelled a little funky when I walked through it. The patio had a great breeze and still the same fabulous service. And the food! The New Orleans barbecued shrimp are definitely worth a try. I was truly impressed with the menu and had a difficult time choosing because everything looked terrific. Everyone at my table enjoyed their entrees and the service was unbeatable., Love-lay! Delicious Nawlins food. A heavenly cocktail made with basil, lime, and tanqueray (did i spell that right?). Crawfish mashed potatoes and the gumbo. Yummy. BF says the duck (make that half a duck) was absolutely divine. I ate so much that I had no room for dessert (crazy, I know). Pricey, but worth every penny. Oh, and the chandelier above our table and the one in the ladies bathroom? Fab. Absolutely fab. I need you all to come decorate my house!, On a recent visit to D.C., we snuck away from the kids for a romantic dinner alone and, Acadiana did not disappoint. I agree with another reviewer that the room felt like a huge hotel lobby, but I loved the chandeliers and our waitress was very attentive, engaging, full of smiles and laughs. I love the cajun/creole food in New Orleans and this was just as yummy, though more refined, but definitely not pretentious. We had the duck which had an out of this world sauce. The only thing I wouldnt order again would be the trio of soup appetizers which came to our table barely lukewarm., This was restaurant week stop #1, and what a way to start off my week. We were seated promptly and pleasantly. They made much of their menu available, which was appreciated by me. My roommate ordered first and selected the sweet corn and blue crab soup. Crap! Thats what I wanted. We diversified our tastes and I ordered the turtle soup. Both were excellent, but hers was divine. Perfectly spiced and extremely rich. A generous portion and a great way to start things off. I was surprised the turtle soup was tomato based, but the extra sherry they give you to mix in gave it a great kick. For her entre, she ordered the crawfish etouffe. Double Crap! Thats what I wanted. I wouldnt budge on this one--Id had it before, and I loved it, and nothing else appealed to me in quite the same way. Following the turtle soup with the etouffe was probably a bad idea--theyre spiced similarly--but it was quite tasty. And the portion was more than I should have consumed. So we get around to the dessert course. What does she order? The brownie and pistachio ice cream that is my favorite. Triple Crap! Doesnt she remember my addiction to all things chocolate? So I order the lemon-flavored creme brulee with berries on top. Im nervous, cause I hate lemon-flavored anything. But bam! Again, both of our desserts are quite tasty. The service was fine--my water glass was never empty--but the waiter a bit surly. I dont think the staff liked him much either. The last time around, the server was much friendlier. A great restaurant week value--and probably a great value at other times. Given my non-profit salary, I love August and January., I went there for restaurant week on Wednesday. Given the fact that we didn have a reservation, I was amazed to be able to get a table for 3 after waiting for less than 10 minutes. It was also great because the restaurant week menu was not some special menu, but at least for the entrees, it was the actual menu. So, I had the fried oyster poboy sandwich, which was excellent. I started with a boring mixed greens salad (I wanted to order the gumbo or the turtle soup, but it was just too hot of a day for soup). Then, I finished with a creme brulee with blackberries for dessert - also excellent. I loved the atmosphere of this restaurant - it is a nice space and our table was actually in a kind of side room, which made for a very quiet and pleasant lunch. I had been wanting to try Acadiana since it opened in DC, having enjoyed it sister restaurant, Ceiba previously. And it did not disappoint at all. I would definitely go back and I hope to get a full non-restaurant week dinner there some day., I came here for my second of two restaurant week dinners. This was a big change from Corduroy (my first restaurant week dinner). The flavors here were definitely bold and fit with the cajun/creole theme. I liked the decor and the service was friendly. Our table was ready when we got there and they were very accomodating to our last minute change in party size.I started off with a nice cocktail called pimms cup which was a nice blend of raspberry, cucumber, and some other goodness. Not to sweet and just the way I like it. I had the gumbo appetizer which was very smoky and not too heavy. I followed that up with the duck which came with my favorite, collard greens! The duck was very tender and based on all the reviews I had read and the high recommendation from the waiter, did not disappoint. Again, I had little room left for the chocolate cake but the bites I had were moist and decadent. The walk back to the metro definitely helped me to digest this rich but tasty meal!, All I want to say is WOW! A friend and I had a lovely meal at Acadiana on Thursday evening. I felt a little underdressed in my jeans but figured it was fine for an early, spur-of-the-moment dinner. We were seated on the upper, above the bar, level which I found a very nice place to be.I started with the Basil Bell, a delicious gin based drink which included muddled basil. My dinner companion was jealous. Here undersweetened smoothie-esque cocktail was not nearly as nice a way to start the meal as beautiful Bell.And I must say that our server was the reason that I chose the lovely basil cocktail and she was very helpful with our selections for the rest of the meal. It was obvious that she not only knew the menu but had also tried most of the selections so she could really make helpful observations when they were requested. I really appreciate that and it was reflected in our tip.On to the meal, my companion and I could not decide on just two appetizers so we splurged and chose three -- special of the day crawfish cheesecake, the trio of deviled eggs, and trio of savory pies. They were all quite tasty and nicely presented. I think I was most impressed with the cheesecake. It was nicely flavored and just enough of a very rich dish that you could enjoy it without going overboard.As my entree, I chose the redfish which was presented on a bed of seafood gumbo (or jambalaya--unfortunately Nebraska raised guys do not always remember the difference) and my friend chose the tilapia special. I really enjoyed all of my dish, the redfish was very nicely done, the gumbo/jambalaya was also very tasty and it was a nice sized portion. Unfortunately, my friend was a little less pleased with her tilapia. As someone who attended school in pre-Katrina New Orleans she educated me about the error that some chefs make when blackening food--they often go heavy with all the seasonings, including the salt. She felt that her tilapia fell into that category. However, she really enjoyed the black eyed pea relish that accompanied her fish. Based on this seasoning mistep I removed on star -- if yelp allowed half stars I would definitely lean toward a 4.5 for Acadiana.We finished up the meal by sharing the chocolate bread pudding with praline ice cream. WOW! uf said!I have been a bit surprised by other reviewers commenting on the expense of Acadiana. Now it certainly was not a cheap meal but I was a little surprised when the check came and the total was less than $120 for the two of us -- two drinks, three appetizers, two entrees and one dessert with very lovely service to boot. I found that to be very reasonable for a downtown Washington meal.I really enjoyed this meal and I plan to recommend Acadiana to others!, Mmmmm...butterIm inserting a 2nd review here. Ate here for dinner during restaurant week last week. Loved the shaved beet salad...I dont know how they cut those beets so perfectly thin, but the pecan vinagrette, frisee and goat cheese were excellent accompaniments. Also had the veal grillades (I know...un PC but I eat veal like once every few years at the most so Im not too worried about it) with the jalepeno cheese grits and sauteed greens. A bit salty but delicious nonetheless. Also had the chocolate cake for dessert which was a lovely ending. as usually the buttermilk biscuits served with butter and pepper jelly were to die for and it was all I could do to no ask them to bring more (If I had I wouldve NEVER been able to finish my dinner). Service was good even though the restaurant was very crowded...though it was a bit loud. Hard to hear my dining companions at times.After a difficult Monday morning in which I drove between downtown DC and Silver Spring twice in 4 hours, I was ready for a nice and relaxing lunch. I decided to try out Acadiana, a Louisiana style restaurant. which is owned by the same group who owns DC Coast, Ceiba and TenPenh. They have a shellfish-heavy menu so I wasnt sure if my shellfish-allergic hubby and I would ever go there for dinner, a good excuse for me to try it out solo. This is one of the better restaurant week deals. They offered a choice of 5 appetizers, 2 desserts but anything on the regular menu was fair game for entrees (except for the $10 surcharge for the crabcakes)To start I had a heirloom tomato and goat cheese tart with arugula. I really liked it except I found the crust a bit sweet...the texture of the crust was fabulous, they just need to save the sugar for dessert. For my entree I had a signture dish: shrimp and grits. It consisted of 6 large grilled prawns arranged around a cake of creamy buttery cheesy grits in a lovely spicy and creamy sauce with bits of ham, bell pepper and onion. A bit salty but very good overall, a great combo of flavors and spice, and a huge portion. For my dessert I had a lovely (and thankfully small) lemon panna cotta with a blueberry compote. The best thing of all was the basket of biscuits they bring to the table...I would be happy just eating those to be totally honest, buttery and flaky...yum. Service was very attentive and quick, I only managed to squeeze in a few pages of reading between each course. I would definitely go back. We have been here for a drink before and they have a fabulous selection of bourbon at the bar., Definitely check this place out...it is one of my favorites in DC. They have put an upscale twist on down-home Louisiana Cajun fare. My wife and I went here for dinner the other night and left stuffed and satisfied. I ordered the trio of pies which are more like cajun empanadas filled with meat, crawfish and vegetables. Absolutely delicious! The redfish was incredible too...tender and served with corn pudding. Washed it down with a Mint Julep and I was in heaven. The service was friendly and efficient and there was probably one staff person to each customer. We never had to wait for anything. Acadiana is not cheap (our meal came out to about $50 a person) but well worth the money. Ill be coming back next time I need a cajun fix!, I signed up for Yelp specifically so I could comment on my meal last night at Acadiana. The food was absolutely terrible. Both my mother and I ordered the crab cakes and they were inedible and Ive never met a crab cake I didnt like. They were served luke warm and I couldnt bring myself to eat more than a few bites- and that was only because I was starving. The wait staff was incredibly rude and our waiter was even condescending when we took more than two minutes to pick a wine. Our sides were the collard greens and the creamed spinach. Both were only barely edible., Scrumptious brunch - maybe the best Ive ever had. The prix fixe brunch was $32, including a small plate, entree, and dessert. I had the seafood gratin crepe, followed by eggs acadiana (basically eggs benedict but with crabcakes), and finished with the bread pudding. Yum! Can I just say, hollandaise sauce (which came atop the first two dishes) is brunch crack. Ill need a 12-step program soon., Id give this 4.5 stars if I could - I was a little concerned about dining here given the previous reviews, which seemed to veer between people that loved the place and folks who hated it.We recently had dinner here with my parents after seeing an ad in the City Paper. Im happy to report that all four of us came away very pleased with our meal, and I would definitely recommend this place, even to diners that arent usually crazy about Cajun/Louisiana cuisine.For appetizers, I ordered the soup trio, which consisted of a chicken soup, turtle soup, and crab soup in small portions. All three were excellent, and I could have eaten any of the three all night - I was particularly curious about the turtle soup, and it turned out great. My mom tried the pie sampler, which had crawfish, chicken, and beef turnover-type things, and again, all three were fantastic. For entrees, I had the duck with dirty rice and greens (fantastic), my wife and dad had the seafood gumbo (also very good), and my mom had the barbeque shrimp (also very good). Our server was friendly and pretty prompt - it took awhile after ordering cocktails for him to show up to take our food order, but after that the timing was very good and everyones food came out straight from the kitchen, so it was still nice and hot and didnt taste or look like it had rested for awhile.I came into this restaurant with no expectations, especially since Im not particularly fond of this type of food. But, after having eaten here Ill say that I will definitely be back - the quality of the cooking was great and everyone commented on how much they enjoyed their experience. Very well done, and suitable for group/business dinners or just a night out with a couple of friends., Would not recommend their happy hour crawfish boil. Astronomically overpriced. You can always judge a good cajun restaurant by their gumbo... this place gumbo was decent-- for washington dc.I don feel the need to go out of my way to go back. The staff was not particularly friendly. Paired with the mediocre food-- Nah, I done., This review is for the Bar only, as I have never had dinner here due to the fact that the nights I have off from my 2nd Job all I really want to do is sleep to be honest. So one night on my way home from work in late December 07, I ran into an old friend of mine on the street outside of Metro Center. Both of us headed home as we just gotten off of work and needed some relaxation. After standing on the corner of 11th and G Streets chatting with each other for like 20 minutes we both thought we should go grab a cocktail and continue this conversation inside somewhere warm (Not that it was like snowing outside or anything. Snow in DC ha-ha). So of course she asked where we should go that would be close to both of us and still be able to relax and chat. I said lets check out Acadiana I have wanted to check it out for sometime now. So off we strolled the few block over, We walked in the door and I have to say the decor didnt disappoint me at all. It was very inviting and reminded me of being back in New Orleans back in the good old days when I used to go every year for Mardi Gras god those where the days. I digress a lot lately need to focus more. So after checking with the host stand to see if it would be possible to get a table for two on a Thursday evening without a reservation - I know better than this but you never know it could be possible. We put our name on the wait list and headed to the bar to check it out. Luck would have it just as we walked up they seated a four top from the bar so we slid right into the seats they had at the bar making sure no one else was waiting for them. We settled in like ducks in a pond and checked out the menu and both ordered a glass of J. Lohr Merlot. Which was spot on I have to say love the spicy, smoky notes in the background as well as the juicy cherry fruit flavors get from this glass of wine. After looking at the bar menu and speaking with the bartender we chose several items; Fried Green Tomatos, trio of deviled eggs, beet salad, trio of soups. None of which was a disappointment at all. I would say that they trio of soups and the trio of deviled eggs went over the best because we ordered 2 more of each! I would say my favorite would be the crabmeat ravigote deviled egg and the Classic turtle soup. We both decided that we needed to make plans to come back to grab dinner soon. I will say we had the chance to have dinner as the host came over about 40 minutes after we had been at the bar to let us know that he had a table for us but we chose to stay at the bar as we really were enjoying ourselves. After spending 2 hours in the bar catching up and enjoy the great small plates we ordered it was getting late and we both needed to get home. So we said we would not go six months without touching base again and promised to make reservation and come in for dinner. But overall this is going to be a place that I come back to the bar to hang out in. Update: My friend moved to Chicago in January for a job and well to be honest I have only been back to enjoy the bar but I promise I will get into the dining room soon to check out Chris Climes food as I know him and he is a great chef!, yummy, yummy, yummy! i love this place. my favorite parts are the biscuits, the iced tea, and the gumbo. from Katie Ss review, i guess theres much better gumbo out there - but i just love theirs! yum. as for the meal, i always get the shrimp and bread dish (forget the name) - its delicious.i agree that the service is not all that. they act like theyre doing you a favor. whatever. the food is good and the atmosphere is very open, very spacious, well-designed. def go., Loved this restaurant. Went here for the first time a few years ago and it wasnt too crowded, but just recently went back and people have definitely discovered this restaurant.Favorites include the biscuits and marmalade, the smoked chicken and andouille sausage gumbo, and the trio of deviled eggs. For the entree, the pan crisped roasted duck was delicious - tender, not too fatty and seasoned just right. Drinks were tasty - I turned the Southern Decadence into an alcoholic drink and it worked great. I think it was Absolute Citron they added, but I just asked if they could make it with alcohol and voila - magic happened. I think it should be a regular cocktail on their menu!Overall, nice casual atmosphere, friendly service (not necessarily fast, but mostly friendly) and tasty fun food. Its a little dark inside the restaurant so if you want to see your dining mate, bring a flashlight. Foods a little on the spicy and flavorful side so if youre looking for a more bland meal, look elsewhere., I was super excited when my officemates suggested we go for a Friday afternoon crawfish boil at Acadiana. We took off work early and headed on down for one of my favorite ways to spend an afternoon.While I am not a Louisiana native, I did spend four collegiate years being schooled in the way of the mudbug. Based on my experiences, this crawfish stood up well! The roux was delicious and spicy, the crawfish were absolutely HUGE, and shrimp were delicious too. My colleagues were impressed with (and slightly terrified of) my knowledge of tail-pinching and head-sucking. Now. There was a group of about 10 of us, and because the day was particularly windy and chilly for May, we sat inside in the designated area. We had some pretty helpful waiters who supplied us with pounds and pounds of crawfish and shrimp, buckets of abita, and eventually appetizers off the actual menu. Things were going well, until the manager informed us that the table we were occupying was reserved and we had 10 minutes to pay our bill and vacate. OH REALLY?We had already spent upwards of 400 bucks in this place, and our total spend was potentially substantial. Ie worked as a hostess, and I understand how it goes with reservations blah blah blah...but he really did everyone a disservice by not accommodating us in some way. No offer to be reseated, no invitation to return, no placement at some other table outside or free consolation beers. Just, scram!. We were a nicely dressed bunch with money to spend, I can barely imagine how this was allowed to happen. Too bad the entire group left with a bad taste in their mouths., I adore this place. I came for restaurant week and was able to order off of much of the main menu. Gumbo, Fillet, and some kind of chocolate cake for dessert- DELISH!My metro stop has a really long elevator ride, and no one ever talks to each other. But I had my Acadiana doggie bag when I was going up the elevator the night I ate there, and two other people gushed with me about how great it was, and a third said she was going there later that week. I have a soft spot for this place since the love of Acadiana made me and my neighbors more friendly., I almost didn go here, the initial impressions were unfavorable, but ended up taking a chance and was richly rewarded. That byplay at the end of this review, let talk about Tuesday dinner for 2.Arrived about 7, and the place was 80% full, but they sat the two of us right away. When I look at the menu, it feels right, I could order almost anything although there some stuff that looks experimental.I always get upset at places that push bottled water too hard, but these guys gave up quick, and brought us biscuits that we both loved, along with a sticky sweet spread. Nice start.The wine list had a bunch of familiar faces, but only on the expensive side, and I wasn in th mood to spend a lot with Cajun food in the offing, but a medium priced unknown did just fine.I had the three soup sampler appetizer. A bit pretentious in presentation, but the chicken gumbo and crab and corn soups were dead on. The gumbo was on the smokey side, but that the way I like it. The turtle soup seemed just fine, but after searching KPauls, Galatoire, and other places, it just not a thing I in tune with. So I give them 3 for 3 so far.My main was the seafood gumbo. and I have to say that it delivered the goods. There was something different there, maybe some butter at the finish, I don know.My wife started with an appetizer made out of watercress, watermellon, spiced pecans... I was extremely skeptical, but she loved it, and I had to admit it might be working. She had the grilled redfish, and we both felt it was competent, and way better than we had any right to deserve in a DC office building.Some folks nearby seemed to be upset about the fact that there weren enough normal i.e. non Cajun items on the menu, and didin like what they got. Why were they there?So bottom lines:- I doubt there better Cajun in DC- Don bring kids there- Stick with the Cajun plan- Don know about the boil- Sure its part of a set/chin of restaurants, but they are competent at all the basics----------------------------------------------------------The bad foreplay:While staying nearby with family, I got online to find a place to take the family, and this was Cajun and a block away so I decided to walk over and check it out.A thin crawfish boil crowd on tables on the sidewalk was trying to decide if the DC summer heat matched the bayou, but they just didn look very happy - it supposed to be a fun event IMHO, and they just looked apathetic.I walked inside to get a feel for the place and see if it was suitable for kids. They said yes, but it didn seem like a good idea given the ambiance., Its rare when I give any restaurant anywhere five stars. It just isnt something automatic. But after deliberating whether to go to this pricey cajun/creole restaurant over some of the other choices I had in Downtown DC (and I wouldve probably gone to Eric Rieperts new place on 22nd if it wasnt for the fact it was a really long walk from my hotel), I decided to see if my New Orleans Bayou palette could tell if this place really was worth it.Turns out, it was.Place is run by a guy who used to work in the kitchen of the Windsor Court near the Riverwalk which is about as good as youre going to get in New Orleans. Now hes in DC and its like a neighborhood Cajun/Creole meal served up by four-star waiters and white linens. OK, maybe a little too classy but this guy worked at the Windsor Court! Biscuits were a major throwback to the kind I used to get at Copelands and I was about to order a Gumbo for my starter and then I saw it.Charbroiled Oysters!A favorite of anyone whos ever been to Dragos in Fat City Metairie, these are a dish I havent had in eons. Hard to find outside of NOLA (Taps in Brea, CA offers it), its loaded with a garlicky flavor and just an incredible sensation rushes over you thats totally orgasmic. Great to run the biscuits through the remains of the butter.Same thing with the Crawfish Etouffee I ordered. Great sauce and plenty of mudbugs. Jambalaya was a bit different but had excellent Andouille that had a kick after you sampled it. Was so full from all the biiscuits that I never got to dessert but they have the traditional New Orleans desserts including Bread Pudding and even a Doberge Cake (not one of my faves....its lots of thin layers of cake with pudding in between the layers instead of buttercreme).Bar offers practically every type of Abita beer available. Even the Root Beer is on tap! No New Orleans Rum though. But I betcha they make a mean Sazerac. Wonder if they got a Daiquiri Machine going too?Service was excellent. Biscuits kept on comin. So did drink refills. GM came to our table to chat up the restaurant too. Ah, if only the chef did just to see if we had mutual pals back down South. Probably do. Oh, and heres a good one. One server though I was Mick Jagger. Seriously. Well, I used to do a good Jagger impersonation as a teen in high school days....What can you say about a place so authentic to New Orleans they even have Zapps Potato Chips to go with the Po-Boys (served on Liedenhiemer bread, no less?). And yes, they gave me one to take back to SoCal because you cant get it here! Now if they could just import Hubigs Pies and some Pralines this might be perfect. Or just some New Orleans themed gift-shop. Then again, this is DC, so well take it! Just too bad I couldnt stick around for the weekend Crawfish Boils in the summer. Ah, no way it could be like the ones down South anyway. You just cant duplicate that., A co-worker (and friend) took me here for my last day of work to celebrate. Her girlfriend was a chef here and hooked us up with an incredible tasting menu of just about every main dish. Course after course came by, each one just as delicious as the last. Im not a huge fan of seafood and for a restaurant to make each seafood dish not only EDIBLE but enjoyable? Thats success right there., My current favorite DC restaurant. And by current I mean for the past couple of years, because nothing else has come along to bump it out of first place and because each time I go back it fabulous. Start with the glamorous, art deco-style interior, and a sumptuous bar which is lit from beneath, so your drink and everything else is just glowing (how fun!). Then the service - ALWAYS friendly and down to earth. And don even get me started on the seating: Who doesn love an upscale restaurant where the seating is mostly booths and banquettes? Come ON!!! And I give it 5 out of 5 stars for lighting. It amazing how many restaurants forget this important aspect of ambiance. Acadiana has it just right.Start your meal with one of the fabulous Southern-inspired cocktails. My favorite: The Bourbon Fizz. Then dive right in to the bread course which is buttermilk biscuits served with jalapeno jelly and clotted cream!! Then any one of the main dishes but, if youe ever going to order fish instead of meat, this is the place to do it. My only complaint was that the last time I was there, (in February, 2008) a couple of the entrees in my party were a bit too salty. The Promise: A Louisiana fish house with a serindipitous blend of Old World traditions and New World Resources. The Reality: Yeah, it THAT, and just a gorgeous space for a fun, stylish, romantic, delicious dinner. MUST DO: Dress to the nines, arrive early and drink your cocktail at the uber stylish bar. Flirt with your date, the person next to you or the bartender --this place was meant for flirting! MUST DON. Sit on the patio. Seriously, this is NOT the place to come and sit outside. The dining room much too pretty to waste., Ive been here a few times, and my most recent trip to Acadiana provoked me to write this mediocre review. All guests at my table, other than me, were disappointed with their meal. Which can mean only one thing: the kitchen is inconsistent and has gotten too wrapped up in the hype of being an above average restaurant in a city of average restaurants. I enjoyed my meal, but I felt as though I was in the minority, with one guest at my table sending their entire entree back for a different one, and another picking out bone after bone in their fish. Nevertheless, I would recommend Acadiana, but dont expect perfection. Stick to the good stuff like turtle soup, fried green tomatoes and grillades and grits (what I had!), The Shrimp and Grits Dish at Acadiana is my new girlfriend.I visited Acadiana for lunch during Restaurant Week in 2006 with a few co-workers.Ive been there once before with my partner (the highlight of that meal were the Charbroiled Oysters; I highly recommend them).This time around, ordered the typical three course meal for $20.00. Unlike some Restaurant Week participants, though, Acadiana give you full access to one of its entrees. Rock on.I ordered a Goat Cheese tart as an appetizer -- too much crust, not enough goatage fromage.The main course, about a half dozen sauteed shrimp surrounding a cheddar grits cake covered in tasty tasso sauce, just about made my week. The grits was delicious and filling, the sauce made me wish I had kept some of the pre-appetizer biscuits around to mop up, and the shrimp were fresh and tasty.Highly recommended. The restaurant itself is cool, a bit of a trek if you live anywhere but Chinatown/Downtown. The bar is fun, Ive been there twice. Friendly staff and pretty people (check out the stuffed baby alligators holding matchbooks on either side of the bar -- theyre real)., Ive been to this restaurant several times and have never been disappointed. Ive taken family, dates and have had business dinners there that have all lived up to expectations.One of the highlights of my meals have always been the Charbroiled Oysters...especially since Im not even a fan of oysters! The deviled eggs trio is a n interesting app as well. The bar with a very attentive and friendly bartender. They made a strawberry drink for my mother with real strawberry pulp which was very tasty. I think the last time i was there, i had the special but unfortunately it was a couple months ago so I dont remember it. I have a hard time giving places a 5 but this is definitely a 4.5!, We love Acadiana, it our favorite DC restaurant. We have been twice for restaurant week and once for Valentines Day. I have never been disappointed by the food or service. The waiters always have great wine suggestions without being pushy. The hurricane is pretty good too (for outside New Orleans).They bring out delicious biscuits with a sweet and spicy made in house jelly while you wait for your meal. I am a fan of the fried green tomato appitizer.The BBQ shrimp and grilled beef tenderloin filet are excellent choices with lots of flavor. We love how the side dishes are just as good as the main entree and really compliment the meal. I also have tried the veal medalians and they were good, but not as good as the shrimp or steak- however the jalepano cheese grilts that came with were divine!A few years ago they had a peanut butter creme brulee, that was so good I ate it with my eyes c losed.* I have also tried sister restaurant Ceiba but did not enjoy it as much (would give it 3.5 stars), Fantastic food. I met my wife here for lunch one weekday and was blown away. She, for some reason, did not feel the same way (I think it was her choice of entree -- some sort of lunch sandwich). Anyway, to start they bring incredible biscuits with a spicy jelly. Then, I had the special of the day, which was a braised pork belly dish served over red beans and rice. It was, without a doubt, the best dish Ie had since moving to D.C. The service was good, though a little slow for the power-lunch we were aiming for. I will be back to Acadiana (possibly sans wife) very soon..., Absolutely all around amazing!! This week we had one of the top 5 meals of my life at this place. I dined here with 3 other people, and tasted some of everything that each person got, and was not disappointed one bit. Here a quick rundown of what we ordered:Apps:Charbroiled OystersFried Green TomatoesChicken & Sausage GumboDeviled Egg TrioEntrees:Tilapia (special of the day) - janiceBBQ Shrimp - nicoleRoast Duck - meVeal & Jalapeno Grits - dianeDesserts:Lemon Tart - dianeCreme Brulee - janiceBeignets - nicoleBread Pudding - meIt was quite a feast for the eyes, nose and especially mouth. The oysters are only $2 a piece (cheaper than most of the nice places in DC) and are by FAR the best I have ever had, anywhere. One of the women who has eaten regularly at Drago in New Orleans even preferred them to the famous place where they originated. They are simply that good, you cannot come here and not order them! (I wish I had ordered 2 servings) The gumbo was very good, the only change I would make is to have the pieces of meat be a bit bigger and of course more spicy. The tomatoes come with a great cocktail sauce on top and a healthy portion of shrimp, a very unique way to serve this dish. The only one of the apps that was lacking in any real way was the trio of eggs, and only because the combinations they come up with just weren pulled off so well, my favorite was the crayfish.We were excited to move on to the main course, after the overwhelming surprise of the great oysters, this was shaping up to be a hell of a night. After reading the Yelp reviews prior to coming there was no way I was ordering anything but the duck, and I am sooooo glad I did! It was pure deliciousness, and it inspired me to make an awesome molasses and rum glaze for some quail at home the next night. There could easily be a war at your table over the leg! Niki BBQ shrimp was good, however I don think it lived up to the hype from the menu (USA Today top 25 dish), mainly due to the fact it was little more than just shrimp in some sauce, and didn really taste much like BBQ either. The veal was the perfect texture, and the carmalized mushrooms they put on top add such a great flavor to the dish. Il pass on judging the tilapia, since it one of my least favorite fish dishes, although it did seem ok if you like it.Dessert didn even seem like a possibility after two huge courses and non-stop wine, but we decided it was in our best culinary interests to take full advantage of the menu while we were there. While none of them were really blow you away type desserts, they were all very solid and finished the evening well. If you want an authentic New Orleans experience (minus the flashing college girls and thick accents) or if you just love damned good food, Acadiana HAS to move to the top of your To Try list!, Went to Acadiana for Restaurant week in Summer 2007. The food was very good. I paid extra for the new orleans style barbeque shrimp, and it was so delicious! The shrimp was plump, and cooked perfectly. Plus the butter sauce it was in, clogged my arteries, but was amazing! Unfortunately, I cannot remember what I had for my first couple courses, but I remember getting the Basil Belle, a drink very similar to a mojito. Very good!! Will definitely go back to., Ahhhhh, Acadiana! What a tasty creole restaurant. My girlfriend had dinner here on a Monday, which if you go to restaurants is one of the slowest days of the week. The service and food here is great! I herald from the Chicago area which is not a hot spot for Cajun/creole food so I was pretty excited about giving this place a try. Needless to say we were not disappointed.The ambiance of this establishment is soothing, fresh, and cozy and service was friendly and unpretentious. We started our meal with martinis (quite tasty) and the seafood crepe and charbroiled oysters. If you ever make it to this establishment I highly recommend the charbroiled oysters, they are quite delectable. In regards to the main course we decided on the sea food gumbo and the fried soft shell crab. Both these entrees came out with great presentation and were quite authentic in their flavors. The seafood gumbo was done just right with the sauce having a nice essence of fish while the soft shell crab was fried perfectly being crispy and tasty. We had no room for desert but would have if stomach space permits. Would definitely recommend this place to anybody in DC or visiting DC., Im a Louisiana native--I spent my first 18 years in a small Cajun town (real Cajun town, not a faux Cajun town like half the state) and spent 7 years in New Orleans. Now, thats out of the way...I like Acadiana a lot. While not everything is perfectly authentic, it is very good--and very much inspired by Cajun and Creole cuisines. I like that this place is a little more laid back than most of the other overpriced mediocre fare downtown. Ive been there a few times, and most of what Ive had has been good to very good, with a couple of greats in there. The charbroiled oysters are quite nice, as are the trio of pies (though only order this app if you have a party of three or four, as its quite large). The fried green tomatoes are good--not the best--but good if youre craving them. The redfish is very tasty--its not a large portion, but their cuts of fish are very good. No fat on it and cooked well. Ive never been for the crawfish, but I would never go for that. My hometown is full of crawfish fields (yes, theyre farmed in fields), so theres just no way that anyone here will impress me. Plus, Im used to paying about 50 cents a pound...I give this place five stars for DC. It wouldnt nearly be this high in New Orleans, but were not in New Orleans :), This restaurant was really hard to assign stars to... and heres why. The martinis are solid and the waitstaff are very well trained. Always a good sign.However...The food? Wow. I mean, yes its restaurant week, but isnt that when you should try to shine & really get your name out there? The chicken gumbo looked & tasted like some kind of Alpo concoction. Completely nasty. Then came the mains... some steak business that my bf ordered and my veal medallions on gritz. Both were acceptable, but certainly nothing to rave about to any degree.Most importantly? I thought Cajun/Creole was supposed to have some kick. There was NO KICK AT ALL to any of our dishes. Hrmph. I guess this will be an after-work bar, and not a restaurant to frequent., Food was alright, but nothing out of this world. Perhaps Im a harsher critic because Im from New Orleans, but it wasnt the satisfying comfort food I associate with Cajun and Creole cooking.Atmosphere was also wanting. Not much pizzazz or singularity. Good service.Looking for Southern food? Id go to Vidalia instead., The cane sugar mint infused lemonade is ridiculously good and not ridiculously priced for a specialty drink, thank you! The filet was pretty good...a bit fatty, the marchand au vin quite a tasty reduction, nice serving size, great ambiance, exceptional staff, you will feel like a valued client. Corn and Crab chowder is fresh, good chunks of crab...good stuff. Only disappointment is that we went for Restaurant Week and it was quite obvious they cut corners on the final course, the dessert...poor attempt. I felt like I was eating refrigerator cake or a brownie. Besides that, I highly recommend Acadiana! Oh, one closing point, the honey butter served with the biscuits was different as the honey is layered on top of the butter...a nice pairing., Loved the biscuits, which are served in lieu of bread. I ordered the etoufee which was excellent. Their crab cakes are also fantastic. Great restaurant., Acadiana so good but also sooo bad for you, which is probably what makes it so good.I went with friends during RW and had a very good, completely filling meal. Our waiter was very friendly and provide good recommendations for wine and their specialty entrees. Wine recommendations were especially appreciated as Acadiana has a very extensive list. On to the food....the bread served were actual biscuits, with cream cheese and pepper jelly spread..... Yeah I thought so too but it wasnt as weird as it sounded. Definitely went with the biscuits. For RW they offered specific starters and deserts but you were able to select an entree from their normal dinner menu. I started with the trio of deviled eggs...oh so divine! Each was topped with a different seafood garnish - crabmeat ravigote, shrimp r39moulade, louisiana choupique caviar. Eggs never tasted so good...For my main entree I had the grilled gulf redfish with seafood jambalaya risotto and smoked red bell pepper sauce. Absolutely fantastic. One of my friends had the pan crisped roasted duck with dirty rice, collard greens, cane syrup pepper jelly glaze and it turned out to be an entire half of a duck. I finished the meal off with warm raisin bread pudding. Wasnt the best Ive had but I like bread pudding and I like raisins so I couldnt complain too much. My table also ordered the brown sugar rum creme brulee - which was cold, very strange and the decadent chocolate doberge cake - they dont call it decadent for nothing, uber rich and almost more fudge-y like than a cake. Overall a very nice experience for RW. Will most likely be going back but maybe after I work off the last meal I had here. They know how to feed you at this place so definitely bring your appetite., Went here for brunch. Not a bad deal, if you plan on not drinking. Its $32 for 3 courses and $10 a pop for mimosas. The appetizers were awesome especially the baked oysters. The deviled egg toppers were good but the actual yolk mixture was nothing spectacular. The creamy grits and veal was absolutely delicious. The veal meloted in my mouth. My date had the shrimp and jalepeni grits which was also very tasty. Really good flavors here. For dessert, I had teh bread pudding which was ok. The service was really good and it was wonderful to sit outside., gonna keep this one short: go. this is a standard meet up for my contingent of southern friends. food is a little expensive for the type and atmosphere, but the location is great and if you are hunting this type of food it is more than worth the cost. there a large outdoor dining area great for hh (abita by the bucket: oh yeah, they got it like that). they have a generous selection of top shelf drinks. for lunch, it a suit & tie crowd and a good meet in the middle spot for the k street crew and the capital hill crowd., I like most of their appetizers better than any entree Ive had there. Im always thinking its too spicy or not spicy enough. Sometimes steak dishes have been over cooked. The trio of pies and the charbroiled oysters are my favoriets., Love it! Other than the fact that its pretty expensive, if youre looking for high quality southern food, this is the place for you. They have really good desserts and drinks as well. Our main dishes were both really good, but Id definitly suggest getting a couple appetizers & desserts to split between people because those were our favorites. Good wine menu & gracious weight staff - nice atmosphere but nothing special. Will be back!, I am going to keep this short and sweet...this place is delicious! Restaurant week is a fantastic time to try it because they offer every entree on the menu ($5 upcharge for the BBQ shrimp.)Cocktails are delicious (I love the Pimms drink.)YOU MUST GET THE DUCK-if you even REMOTELY like duck, or have never tried duck, GET IT. It goes through a 3 day cooking/prep process and it is divine-Enough said----, We went here with a large group. Somehow our reservation got screwed up so they only had us down for 4 people rather than 10, but they fit us in without much of a hitch. The food was outstanding. I had the barbecued shrimp, which I have sorely missed since the days when our conferences went to New Orleans regularly, and their version lived up well to my memories. I also had the corn and crab soup which was great. Another great dish was the special macaroni and cheese, which I think had crab and was really tasty. Definitely a good place to go for high-end cajun/creole., I guess I really should have gotten the charbroiled oysters...I got to come to Acadiana under the best of circumstances. I was invited to a focus group there (read: FREE meal!!!). Our group was put in a nice private room in the back. Despite the weird panoramic wallpaper, the room was perfect for our focus group.Wine: I had the Mark West pinot noir which was good, but nothing spectacular.Soup: I had the corn and blue crab soup and it was deeelicous! Definitely five-star worthy. It was the perfect texture and just sweet enough.Entree: I had the Mahi Mahi, which was not very good. The pureed sweet potatoes were delicious, but the mushroom sauce was waaaaay too salty. I could feel my blood pressure rising, and it completely destroyed the taste of everything else on the place. The Mahi Mahi was also overcooked.Thankfully, I didnt pay for this meal myself, but if I am to spend $25 on an entree, I would expect higher quality goods. I am willing to give Acadiana another chance since it seemed like I might have made the wrong choice with the Mahi Mahi., DC Coast is not a favorite of mine so heading out to lunch at Acadiana my expectations were not high nor would they be difficult to exceed. First things first, the restaurant is lovely, it is open and inviting, it is not too noisy, great big windows, and yet the tables all seemed to have a bit of privacy. The staff was friendly and attentive - top marks. The food was delicious, especially the roasted sweet corn and blue crab soup, if it had not been lukewarm (at best) it would have perfect...note to the kitchen: soup should be hot. The b.l.t salad should be taken off the menu....I dont know how it is possible to screw up lettuce to such a degree, but it was awful. It was warm and limp, the dressing was watery and the croutons tasted like they were out of a box, seriously, this was the worst salad I have been served in a restaurant since I can remember. The main course however, Red Fish over seafood jambalaya was fantastic! One of the nicest pieces of fish I can remember tasting...it was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly and the accompanying seafood jambalaya was brilliant 10 out of 10. All in all an impressive lunch, if the soup had been hot I would have given Acadiana 5 stars (despite the salad!)., I had put off sampling this restaurant for years now. I think it must be because it in the street level space of a very boring looking office building, and walking into the restaurant reminds me of going to work; at which point I want to stab myself in the eyes. Nonetheless, my love for cajun food would be denied no longer, and so after being denied a table at Brasserie Beck, we sauntered over here in the rain.Well, as soon as you enter the front door you quickly forget youe in a boring ass office building. The space is large, airy, interesting, and invites lounging around and drinking. We opted for a seat at the bar, which itself was a great place to grab a meal. It enormous, deep, and has a huge marble top lit from beneath. There a huge array of whiskeys and bourbons; I went for my biggest temptation..the hurricane. God damn these things are good! It was all I could do to not order 4, take off my top, and shake around my man tits for beads. Slightly buzzed, and very happy, I opted for the seafood gumbo. At $21, it one of the more economical entrees; we also ordered jalapeno grits on the side. Both came out quickly and were very yum. I think the gumbo could of used some more KAPOW!!!, but 5 shakes of Tabasco got it where it needed to be.All in all, its a wonderful place to pass the hours with good drinks and good friends. And it a unique menu for the area., Wow!That was my first reaction to this place after the first bite. This place is one of the best meals Ive had in a long time.Came on New Years Eve for their fixed price menu.I had the broiled oysters for appetizer which were simply amazing. Melt in your mouth tender and great flavor. My girlfriend had the fried green tomatoes which were good, but nothing special. The cocktail sauce on them was a bit overpowering. For the entree, I had the barbecued shrimp and she had the redfish. Both were incredible! Shrimp were perfectly cooked and the rosemary based sauce was very tasty and great for dipping the bread into.The chocolate/orange cake was fantastic. Rich and dense but a great way to round out the meal. She had the bread pudding, which was very tasty, but way too buttery.Cocktails were pricey and okay, but nothing great.Service was very prompt and very courteous. Cant wait to go back., Ive been here twice now, and can happily say Ive left satisfied both times. The first was a group dinner, and honestly I dont remember my entree. But I do remember the corn and blue crab soup. It was excellent. I recommended it to a friend on my second go-round and he agreed. The turtle soup definitely looks interesting, so perhaps Ill have to hit that one up next time around! I ordered the fried green tomatoes for an app. They were fried in a batter, so they had a crispy coating. Covered in a reddish, tangy sauce and came with shrimp. It was very nicely done, though at $12 for 3 slices, it better be good.For my entree I had the chicken and andouille sausage jambalaya. I was really happy with my order. The chicken was good but the sausage was reeeally good. The dish was flavorful and well seasoned. My coworker had the catfish, which she was very pleased with. She said that it was the first time she hadnt needed to season a dish on her own. Service was attentive without being overbearing, but it was definitely loud in the dining room and would have appreciated my waiter speaking just a bit louder. The atmosphere was fun, and definitely not stuffy at all. Im planning on trying their brunch one day soon. And I really need to get my hands on some charbroiled oysters...Definitely lots of nice looking options on the menu., The food is delicious, but this is a once-in-a-while place--unless you want to die of a heart attack. Definitely not diet-friendly. That said, Ive never had anything bad here. The biscuits with pepper jelly are a real treat. Order the delicious turtle soup., Heading out to the core of DC the night of all of the inaugural balls was a risk. I called in advance (twice) to see about reservations and was told no problem to come on in. Sure enough we were seated immediately in a great seat by the window. Watching the ladies skip along the path with heels in hand while freezing was the theme of the night. The passing of the Presidential motorcade was extra... So on to the food. I informed the waiter I had high expectations having grown up in New Orleans. He out cajun-ed me with where he was from in Louisiana. I was not disappointed by even one detail. Too often New Orleans or Louisiana themed restaurants are a painful letdown. Not the case here. Every dish was on point and we had several. My date let me order for him and I decided to go with the $44 price fix presidential meal. Started with a Turbo Dog Purple Haze for me, he had Turbo Dog on tab and double Jack. Since we really did eat alot, maybe a list would be easier: Buttermilk biscuits with jalapeno butter Fried Green Tomatoes Gas Station Boudin Balls (for real - AWESOME) Oyster Rockefeller Barbecue Shrimp Scallops with Black Eye Pea fried thing Crazy delish chocolate cake with AWESOME banana cream ice cream Beigets (sp) with Coffee An glaze Cafe au lait Total bill with 20% tip was only $180. I highly recommend Acadiana. It was a great end to a wonderful Inauguration weekend in DC.
3|art-and-soul-washington|For the first time ever I am stumped as to what to say in a review, Art and Soul is such a culinary delight and cant put it into words I have eaten there 3 times in the last week just to make sure that what I feeling and tasting was not a fluke. It was not let me tell you as I had it confirmed by my Boss and the rest of the eight people I sent to have dinner there last night. Lets start with the d39cor subtle but has a great WOW factor from artwork, to the booths, the tables everything about the d39cor screams I want to be here all the time. Casual but upscale in the same breathe. I started in the bar as we all know I love cocktails and let me tell you the cocktails are out of site here! I have now had the Perfect Margarita with patron silver tequila, fresh lime juice & del maguey agave crema (2 of these and I was good) and the Rickey Ricardo which is made with Plymouth gin, fresh lime juice & fees cilantro bitters and some spicy ice cubes OMG is all I can say.) All I wanted to do was keep drinking and not do anything thing else but alas I also wanted to try the food. So on to the things that made my toes curl in such a way it was just crazy! Yes, its true it is a bit expensive but what isnt these days and as far as I am concerned I would rather spend my money on food than anything else. If I am going to have to learn to be poor (or cut back my spending) its just not going to happen. I would rather die than not eat well. So here is what we had; OMG we thought we died and went to heaven when we had the what I would call monkey bread (Skillet Bread) which is a puff bread with butter and a cheese served in a cast iron skillet served table side. (I will never admit to how many we asked for of these amazing puffs of goodness) Then we moved on to the following appetizers; Shrimp wrapped in Smithfield ham w/grits, the She Crab Bisque with crab fritters & aged bourbon and then OMG, the spiced rubbed Ahi Tuna with fried green tomatoes & sour pickle relish. Then we worked our way to the Hoecakes - I cant even tell you how scrumptious this was as I would get my review deleted for use of language - Had the Land and Sea Hoecake with Blue crab, Braised Beef, brie it was so .............. Then it was on to the main courses which just as amazing as the rest of the meal, We have tasted the Salmon with roasted new potatoes, fresh pickles, and a lemon caper tartar sauce, The Grouper with buttermilk mash potatoes, pesto ribbon root veggies, and a carrot cider broth and finally the Scallops with parsnip puree and a smoked onion marmalade which knocked me off my seat it was so good. For sides we had the Macaroni Casserole and Crab Risotto which both I am just going to say you have to try. Then it was on to dessert and dont be giving me that look like after all that you had dessert you are ...... Right we did! The trio of Ice Cream from Moorenkos which is local to Maryland, lets just say we licked the containers they came in clean and the flavors are off the hook; Sweet Potato Praline, Lemon Goat Cheese, Bourbon Cherry Chip and the not on menu Vanilla Bean with the Sweet Potato Bread Pudding which lets just say was .......... Of course every new restaurant has its issues but I have to say they if they had any I didnt see them neither did my boss or his group. My boss said the meal and service was wonderful as did the rest of the people in the group when I got into work today they all raved about the food and dessert and loved that Chef Ryan came out to say hi to them all. Score one for me with the boss!, Tried this place for the first time 11/9/08 with a couple of friends - our trio loves to try new restaurants in town. Art and Soul impressed us! The lighting is a bit odd - different fixtures with different light qualities - and the red and black seemed a bit 1980s - though not so as to make me not want to go back. I LOVED the food and will be back for sure! Waitress was Anna - she was a hit with us, and Scott the manager was a blast as well. We had the Pantry Hoecakes - smack your granny good! Mac n Cheese and Green Bean Cassarole - comfort food fabulous! Pork Chop, Brunswick Stew, and Lamb Chops all wonderful! Patio looks fun - cant wait for a bit of warm weather to go try it out - or next Spring if we have missed that opportunity! Ask for Anna to wait on you if you like to have a bit of fun with your wait person!, Im giving this 3 and not 4 stars because of lackluster and unprofessional service.Moving past that unpleasant part of the evening, the food was quite good. We started with the much-discussed Land and Sea hoecake and were not disappointed. Braised beef with lump crab meat and brie - who knew that would be a winning combo, but it was. The Capitol Hill salad was delicious with apples, blue cheese, and sweet, crunchy pecans with a really nice, balanced vinaigrette.Everyone around the table loved their entrees - rockfish with a super rich risotto, grouper and salmon were both nice, and the ravioli were a big hit. We ended with a warm pomegranate apple crisp (!!), the bread pudding (also !!) and assorted mini cupcakes (good flavor but a bit on the dry side).All in all, I am hoping to attribute the lackluster service to its relative newness and plan to come back for a good meal on the Hill. Also a great bar for after work cocktails., I went here for restaurant week and liked the place. I am usually wary of many downtown restaurants - I find the decor overly hip and the food lackluster. Art and Soul, however, was an exception. I had the squash ravioli and it was delicious and the sauce was quite innovative. The desserts are to die for., I went Art and Soul on 12/6/08 with a friend who had been there twice before. He had had a great experience on both occasions and was eager to return. Several of the staff members recognized him and greeted him. The decor is simple and elegant and the service was professional and not overbearing.The food was amazing! I started with the arugula salad which had a blackberry-ale vinaigrette, watermelon pickles, almonds and goat cheese. At first I thought that there was too much vinaigrette but it wasnt too sweet and paired really well with the spicy arugula and the creamy goat cheese. My date and I both had a duck special that consisted of duck 3 ways: a sausage, sort of a shredded confit and then an amazing piece of med-rare breast. SOOO good. It was served with the mustard and really good sweet and sour cabbage. We didnt have any dessert but we did have a nice bottle of Grenache. The wine list was manageable and had a nice selection of wines by the glass. It was a little bit pricey but I would go back in a heartbeat and will definitely keep it in mind for a special occasion. Next time I want to try some of the specialty cocktails., You know, when you find a good high-faluting white trash/soul food restaurant, there just aint no words for it. Georgia Brown tries to be that restaurant, and has the decor part down, but the food just doesnt rise to the occasion.Art and Soul on the other hand takes down-home cooking and twists it in a lovely way. I mean when you serve a hoe cake covered in braised beef, blue fin crab meat, and melted blue cheese, I just have to reply, oh, my God, that is good. And then to serve me grouper with buttermilk mash potatoes, pesto, ribbon vegetables, and carrot cider broth. That chef had me at, your dinner is served. So this down-home girl is officially happy. A place where I can get a plate of hoe cakes and some fish. Wow. Im a going back., I had a pretty phenomenal time at this place over Inauguration Weekend. Art Smith has absolutely outdone himself, here, and the lovely thing is that unlike his Chicago restaurant, you can actually get a table here!It is upscale comfort food at its best --spicy collards, melt-in-your-mouth mac n cheese, short rib so tender it seems to melt off the bone. There was not a single bad or off note here. Im not a big cooked oyster person but the oyster hoecakes here were amazing. I dig that kind of innovation.There was a private party the night we were there where Bill Clinton and Mayor Daley attended (Daley even stopped at our table to take pics), and Art was there that night. It was very cute to see him pacing around the restaurant and chatting with patrons. For the quality of the food and service, it is well worth the price. Reservations are highly recommended, as the venue is not very large. Oh, and save room for dessert. The individual mini-cakes (including Red Velvet!) truly hit the spot after all that great food., Great Southern style food with an upscale twist. The Brunswick Stew was phenomenal and the pork chop with red eye gravy and the chicken were great. Service was decent and the wine list was fairly impressive (try a glass of the Belle Vallee Pinot Noir, it was very good!). Nice place!, This place is the reason I created a Yelp account, I went here the day before Valentines Day, and I was so excited to go. All I heard were great things about this place- Executive Chef Art Smith had won a James Beard Award, the reviews on this site were great, and it was impossible to get a reservation during restaurant week- so I figured it must be good. The food was ok, nothing special. I had the grouper, and the best thing about my meal was the mashed potatoes- isnt the fish supposed to be the star of the dish? The Chesapeake Bay fry was on the bland side, and the okra was horrible. My boyfriend had the short ribs and didnt seem too impressed. For desert we shared the apple and pomegranate crumble, which wasnt anything special.Our waiter was terrible, and maybe if we had had better service, our overall experience would have been better. Everyone in our section seemed annoyed and tense, not the best dining atmosphere. The best part of our meal were our drinks.This place is overpriced, bland, and mediocre at best. Creme on U Street is a better representation of upscale comfort food. If you are going to make the trip to Art and Soul, stay at the Art Bar and enjoy some cocktails instead of wasting your time in the dining room., I hate to say I was not impressed. Granted we gave it a go during restaurant week which was not my choice, but whatever. I had the Brunswick stew, the short ribs and the baby cakes. My friend had the Capitol salad, the pecan crusted chicken, and the sweet potato bread pudding. My stew, my short ribs, and my baby cakes were all pretty good. However, my friend and I switch plates halfway through. His salad was good. The chicken was bland on creamed spinach which was bland and had a sweet sauce on it which was out of place. He seemed to like his sweet potato bread pudding. I love bread pudding, but hate sweet potatoes so I didnt even taste it. However, given the press on the place my expectations apparently were set a little too high. Everything other than the chicken was fine, but not fabulous. The chicken was dull. The decor was interesting and comfortable. It is a little strange and may very well have been decorated by a straight man, but I didnt find it overly strange or the least bit unpleasant, but comfortable. I will agree with Katie K., the drinks are where it is at. The service was very pleasant. Our waiter came off as a know-it-all to my friend, but I thought he was fine, maybe gave more information than was necessary when we asked what was in something... I mean, did I ask for the recipe? However, he was polite, fun and completely competent., The food at this place is not that great. The drinks were great. However the food is not worth the price. The tastes and flavors leave a lot to be desired. The bay fry appetizer was okay except for the fried okra. I was expecting rings of breaded fried okra. The dish came out with very thinly sliced breaded and burnt okra strips. For a main course I had the short rib. The meat was tender and had a pretty decent flavor, but Ive had better around the city for a lot lower price.I suggest trying creme on U street if you want this type of food., Wel get to the food and all that in just a second. But first off..the kumquats. Do you eat them? Do you not? I ask because when my friends and I arrived at Art and Soul, there was a giant bowl of kumquats on the table. How nice, we thought. instead of bread, there kumquats. And then we proceeded to eat the kumquats--only to have a waiter swoop in out of nowhere and remove the bowl with not a word. A exploratory look around the dining area on a trip to the bathroom noted that bowls of kumquats are only located on tables where there are no diners eating. Did my friends and I just eat the decoration for the table? If so, I blame the fact that wee Asian...who puts a bowl of fruit on a table in front of Asians and expects them to view it as not actual food?Moving on to the food which is food and not posing as decoration:The bread as mentions is unbelievably delicious. I stuffed far too many of those fluffy and buttery goodnesses into my mouth and became full before the meal actual came. Not that it matter, I ate far past what should be comfortable because I was determined to eat as many free bread goodnesses as possible. Brunswick stew: good, although potentially over smokey for those who don like such things.Salmon: EXCELLENT! Salmon is supposedly easy to cook...but that doesn explain why restaurants and people overcook salmon so much. Not to say that overcooked salmon still isn good, but when it cooked properly and the right shade of pink--delicious. Pecan crusted chicken: I only had a bite of this, but since I got the fried chicken at Georgia Brown restaurant week--I will say that Art and Soul chicken blows Georgia Brown out of the water in terms of how it cooked. Juicy and tender whereas my Georgia Brown chicken was overcooked and dry.Dessert: Eh. Weakest part of the meal by far. Baby cakes are indeed cupcakes which are nothing superb. The cherries used in the desserts (all of them, including the baby cakes) were apparently weird and gross according to my friends. I have no say in this, but given that one of my eating partners never has a bad thing to say about any food, Il take his word for it.I go back...but I probably stick to the main courses we tried, stock up on the free bread, and skip the dessert., Eating here last week was definitely one of the top overall dining experiences Ie had in the city and I would highly recommend this restaurant.The decor is very modern and it all feels brand new. All of the wait staff were extremely knowledgeable and very attentive. Plates were cleared quickly, the waitress stopped by several times to check on the meal and our glasses were always full. Plus they escorted you to the bathroom instead of just pointing you, which I loved.The pan bread they serve you when you sit down is excellent. It buttery and hot and sort of like a mix between a croissant and a biscuit.For apps, we shared the brunswick stew and The Pantry hoecake. Both were excellent. The hoecake was essentially a salad on top of a cornmeal pancake, which sounds boring but was actually irresistible.The highlight of the meal was my main, which was a beef short rib. It was tender and not fatty at all. My girlfriend had the pork chop which was chewy and tough, and I wouldn recommend ordering it again. The dessert was the babycakes, which were really just five small cupcakes with different flavors and icings. They were fun to sample but all in all not amazing. Next time I try the sweet potato bread pudding., Because of its name & hype, I wanted to like it. But it did not live up to my expectations. We were celebrating a birthday and even though we put on the reservation it was a special occasion, they did nothing. The manager went to every table around us except for ours. And when we told her that she ignored us she gave US attitude. So if you want to celebrate a special occasion, dont do it here! The food was ok not worth making a special trip for. My fish was dry and the sides were just ok. The desserts are a big PASS...not worth the money you pay for them. They really need to train the manager on customer service because she has no idea how to handle a customer that has an issue. Overall, not worth the trip. There are other places that serve much better southern cuisine for a better value and a better experience., Went here for Restaurant Week as well. Strike One: FIrst thing I DID NOT like about this place was the bar. Wow, was it small! Like ridiculously small. I thought the bartender would see me since the bar was tiny and I was the tallest person there. But no, waited and waited for a drink. No dice, so I left the bar area and went to the waiting room in the hotel lobby area.Strike Two: At first the hostess gave us a hard time b/c we changed our party size from 6 to 5 and for some reason we had to wait an additional hour b/c we subtracted one person. Obviously the restaurant was very busy b/c of RW, but after 10 minutes the hostess finally sat us down.Strike Three: Our server took forever to bring us bread (one of my biggest pet peeves is asking for bread when it should be there as soon as your drinks come out. To top it off, he didnt give us the butter/jam that comes with the bread so we asked another waiter. Tell me why he looked at us as if we had 1,000 heads. Simple question, bad reaction by the waiter. Shame on you!Bonus points: My entree, the salmon with pickled cucumber was VERY good. Dessert was small cupcakes/mini cakes and they were delicious. Summary: I dont get the hype, but thats the same hype that surrounds any new venue in any major metro area. In my opinion, Georgia Browns is better, friendlier, more delicious, and cheaper., Went for restaurant week recently and was very happy that I tried it. I dont know about paying full menu price for what is offered. All of the food was definitely tasty, but I just dont get paying for fancy, down-country food. It just doesnt go. That said, the space is nice and spacious though a bit on the side of corporate cold. It is very close to where I work so that is a major plus and they seated us very promptly. Something thats important for a workday lunch.The bread bowl was very good. Soft, buttery, and warm. Couldve had a whole meal of bread. But then it was on to the Brunswick Stew. Close to what Ive had down south. Tasty, but just not enough flavor for me. Kind of on the bland side.I had the fried chicken which was done the way it should be. Crisp, not too bready, and juicy meat underneath. Well done, but if it wasnt RW, I dont know if I would have extracted the same value/enjoyment from the chicken. All in all a great meal, in my opinion, a tad overpriced for what you get, but I think this place is definitely a good one., truly delightful food--the oyster po boy hoecake was particular inspired, and the beef short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. i was a little annoyed by the service, however--our waiter was competent but overly solicitous, asking for our drink & appetizer orders less than a minute after being presented our menus, and checking back in a little too frequently. he did not, however, notice for a while after that my date had accidentally spilled her water. the other waitstaff seemed more subdued, and thus appropriate to a room of this calibre., Things I thought were good: the beer on tap selection was inventive and didnt just pull in the standard upscale selections; the wine and cocktail list looked creative as well. The skillet bread that was brought to the table was as warm and buttery as others have mentioned, a bit like a more sinful croissant (if thats possible). I also thought the hoe cakes were an interesting concept that worked unexpectedly well.But the rest of the experience was a disappointment. I had the salmon with fresh pickles and roasted potatoes. I dont normally order salmon but was in the mood, however this fish was woefully over cooked. Others had a squash ravioli that was ok but not great, and the rockfish which seemed to be the star of the evening.All in all, it was an average experience until the bill came. 2 apps, 3 entrees, 4 beers = $155 including a 20% tip. Considering we didnt get any sides, desserts, or wine, Id hate to see what the total had been for average food had we gone all out., My biggest complaint was hands down the service. The waiter would take forever to make it to our table (except when we were paying the check). He seemed so disappointed when we didnt order expensive drinks or a bottle of wine. The folks clearing the tables dropped a plate of someones leftovers down my back. We ordered their babycakes for dessert with cappuccinos. The two cappuccinos showed up after we finished the dessert and they tasted like steamed milk with coffee flavoring. Yuck! For what we paid to eat here, I would not return. Its sad, as the food was good. Thumbs-up on the Salmon and ThePantry., we came hear with a group of 6 before a law formal ..the skillet bread is A-mazing. perfectly buttery and fluffy! and yes like most people said, the kumquats on the table were confusing.the ceasar looked good....i got the arugula salad and it ended up being great. my fiance got the capitol hill salad, but it was too heavy on the garlic for him to eat all of it.the scallops i got were delicious...who knew you could put pickled veggies on shellfish! the others at the table got the pork chop, grouper, salmon, and the short ribs and they all had nothing but good things to say!the only negative id say was the bar was slow at getting us drinks, but it was a saturday night. ill be coming back...mostly to try out some of their desserts!, Wow. I don know where to begin. We came here for brunch for a double celebration--birthday and farewell. What was supposed to be a nice visit with friends quickly spiraled into the brunch from hell.First, the bartender didn know how to make Bloody Marys. How do you not know that? Isn it one of the most basic drinks? Shouldn that be a qualification if you are working a brunch service where the drink is highlighted on the menu? Sorry I have no desire to drink tomato juice spiked with vodka and celery salt. The waiter brought us some black pepper and tobasco and took them off our bill. I couldn even finish mine--so gross.Then there were way too many people doing too many different things. The bartender, the waiter, the cinnamon bread guy, the tea lady, then the 2 managers that we needed to talk to....too many people with zero communication amongst them definitely made for a bad brunch.So we ordered and we waited for a while before they brought the food out. Whoops, they forgot my food. By the time they brought it, everyone was sending their food back for being cold--friend chicken and gravy is not so good cold. I had the picnic hoecakes...definitely smaller than what I expected. They were served on a burning hot plate yet were cold--pulled pork and baked beans are disgusting cold, but at that point I was so hungry I ate it. And it sat in my stomach like a greasy rock for the next 3 hours while I wished I had the courage to jam my finger down my throat.Everyone got new chicken and potatoes but by that time we were pretty pissed. One friend had to send hers back a total of 4 times because apparently they can comprehend the meaning of gravy on the side.We had 2 managers come help us but they were creepy whisperers, not take-charge managers. Also on a strange note, the lights kept going on and off. We asked about it later and apparently it was to keep the staff calm--apparently they were getting heated from being reprimanded about our orders. Honestly, if you can handle brunch for 8 people, maybe you aren in the right line of business. We were told that our bill would be adjusted, and that we could order drinks and dessert on the house. So we did. They also brought out these little cupcakes for us which would have been nice if I didn feel like grim death from eating those greasy cold hoecakes. I had the pecan pie and it was kind of gross--the filling was lumpy and weird, like the molasses they used was congealed and old. The saving grace was the bourbon peach tea that I washed it down with.Then we get the bill--they deleted random things from it and CHARGED US FOR THE DRINKS THEY OFFERED ON THE HOUSE. At this point we were so fed up with their sheer inability to get anything right that we just let it go. Also splitting the bill was a nightmare with all of their random charges and deductions, it made absolutely no sense whatsoever.Our brunch here definitely ruined the tone of our day. We will not be back. Maybe Art should play a more active role in his restaurants--I will never try another., I love Chef Art (Table 52, his restaurant in Chicago is DIVINE), so I thought I would come here for brunch with some friends and see what everyone has been talking about...Chicken & Waffles: YUMMY YUMMY..it comes with 2 pieces of fried chicken(dark meat) smothered with sausage gravy, and waffles topped off with walnut butter and delicious maple syrup.Beet cured salmon hoecake: AMAZING and beautiful presentation...beet-cured salmon atop of a hoecake with dill creme fraiche, caviar and caper berriesChicken apple sausage was also delicious, but the bacon was WAYY to saltyCocktail list is excellent, and I tried about 5 on the list..all delicious..if only i could remember their names..but they are kinda priceyUnfortunately our server didnt really know that much about the food and cocktails, but was fairly attentive..and another thing that is kind of strange is that you really feel like you are eating in a hotel lobby, but if you get one of the cool booths then you will def. enjoy yourself.all in all, a great time!, jem had the holograms. carrie bradshaw had her cosmo-lovinladies. dorothy had the scarecrow, tin man and cowardly lion. hell, even those car-burnin man-hatinladies of waiting to exhale had each other. no matter who you are in life, you can get by without your friends. and like the rest, i have a crew that i will roll with until i die - my east coast foodie ladies. we headed out to dinner while i was in town for a wedding. my oprah-obsessed friend, R.R. chose the place, presumably after hearing that chef art smith used to cook for the talk-show icon. the name art and soul perfectly captures the restaurant identity crisis; half of the decor is swanky and modern (art) and the other half is rustic and down to earth (soul). but somehow the minimalist chandeliers and the granite knife rests manage to co-exist in peace. libations? delicious. we started with a bottle of champagne and branched out to wine, blackberry mojitos, and a yummy cocktail called bella kiss - a combo of champagne, strawberries, and basil. the food was delicious as well. highlights for me were the ahi tuna appetizer, served atop some fried green tomatoes; the crabcake that came with the MD crab trio; and my personal fave, the lamb loin, which was served with baby artichokes, white bean puree and romesco sauce. it was so incredibly tender and flavorful, i stopped the server from clearing my friend partially eaten plate so i could snarf down the scraps. skip the salmon, which was just sort of bland, and if youe a vegetarian, as my friend Ashley B. is, i suggest following her lead and putting together your own meal of sides and apps, rather than going for their lone veggie option. too full of booze and dinner, we skipped dessert, but that just means wel have to go back soon! great dinner. great service. great friends. who could ask for anything more?, I went here for Brunch and had their fried chicken. It was interesting that there wasnt many more options for brunch, but oh wells. The chicken was extremely tasty. Light and crisp, the best fried chicken ever. Everything else is forgettable. The bread, the service, the atmosphere. I actually didnt have any dessert because I didnt feel like spending my entire afternoon waiting for it. It took a long time to get our food. I finished my apple juice waiting for food, and afterwards, no one asked to get me another one. And I sat waiting and waiting for my water to be filled too, and needless to say, no one did. So I decided to do something not very like me, and skip the dessert. The chicken was plenty, and made me go into food coma. We thought about booking a room upstairs since its in a hotel, just so we can take an afternoon nap. I would come back when Im in the mood for some yummy chicken. The service has alot that can be worked on though., The only reason that I managed to excuse two stars was giving the rest of the reviewers the benefit of the doubt. First and foremost, let me confess from the outset that I cannot speak to the food. Regrettably the atmosphere was so comically terrible that I did not manage a bite. Simply stated, our highlight of the evening was the Iron Maiden tank-top that was well paired with cutoff shorts and ridiculous flip-flops. Sadly, our Iron Maiden aficionado found steep competition in both dress and manner. The food might be wonderful, but the hotel bar hell atmosphere was so horrific that we left for greener pastures.The Holiday Inn flag may have left the property, but alas, our experience was no holiday and far closer to the 2-star flag often becoming the original hotelier., I really wanted to like this place, but the experience left me terribly disappointed. I do not think that the problem is with the preparation of the food. I sampled a few things off the plate of my friends and some things were enjoyable. My issue is really with the staff. Our waitor, who was a nice guy, just did not know the menu (at all) and as a result he could not make good recommendations nor could he help me navigate through the ordering process to make sure I knew and understood the small (yet often important) preparation details that a menu leaves out. This one waitor might have been an anamoly to the rest of the staff, but I left disappointed and a bit hungry., Best Fried Chicken EVER!!!! So moist and spicy and tasty. We ordered it for dinner even though its only on the brunch/lunch menu. Their skillet bread is buttery and almost tastes like a croissant. Its kinda noisy in there or our server spoke really softly since we had a hard time hearing him. Added bonus is with coffee they gave us peanut brittle... YUM, I went here last night to take advantage of restaurant week. I have to say, I was...underwhelmed. Actually, it left me with the same feeling that Central did, which was that it had a whole lot of potential during the appetizer and the dessert, but tripped and fell on its face during the entree. I had the arugula salad, the fried chicken and goat cheese drop biscuit that Ive heard so much about, and the pecan peach crumble fr dessert. The arugula salad was pretty tasty with almonds and sauteed onions and a blackberry sauce. The dessert was standard, but was made delicious by the amazing, nutty caramel sauce that adorned the plate. However the chicken was almost inexcusable. The drop biscuit was obviously stale, the gravy was SERIOUSLY oversalted, the fried chicken was not crispy in the slightest and the whole mess was adorned with these pathetic baby vegetables that looked like they had been blanched to within an inch of their lives. The only redeeming quality was that the chicken meat itself was tenderGranted, its restaurant week, so I can definitely cut a little slack, but after having the Chef owner just come off a run from Top Chef Masters the restaurant should have been prepared to use restaurant week as a time to shine and gain repeat customers. As it stands, I will not be returning., Just finished my RW meal here and I must say I was very impressed. I had the caesar salad to start which was the perfect portion, exceptional dressing, shaved parmesan, a whole anchovy, and a deviled egg! Whens the last time you had a deviled egg at a restaurant? And it was good too! Since so many Yelpers had been raving about the fried chicken, what else was I going to order? And it was great. Crispy on the outside, perfectly seasoned, tender, served on a perfectly sized portion of mashed potatoes and all topped with a lite sausage gravy. I finished with the peach crumble which was pretty good. Nothing exceptional but a nice dessert. Oh, and did I mention there were three pieces of fried chicken? The serving sizes were very generous for RW. I was impressed. Other: Service was friendly and prompt. The decor is nothing special, but fine. Dined with five other people who ordered a wide variety of dishes from the RW menu. The ravioli was liked as was the shrimp appetizer (huge portion as well). Would definitely go back!, sleek modern decor with warm lighting creates a comfortable ambience. think W hotel. as for the hostesses, not so warm. over the phone, they gave one member of our party of 4 the impression we could dine at 6:30 on a friday night without reservations. when we walked in at that time, they denied ever having such a policy or ever saying that (and stopped short of blaming us for the sucky rainy weather). we ate at the bar lounge after much hovering and waiting. this is frustrating when there an empty adjacent dining room, likely with late evening table reservations. be warned: random yahoos with laptops will treat the bar lounge like it a starbucks, as they claim whole couches to themselves, seemingly not ordering anything. when we finally found a bar table, we tried the house cured salmon and caviar hoecake. eh. it was a-ight. flavorful, but not particularly memorable as anything more than a thin pancake with some savory-salty fixins. the refreshing pitcher of berry mojitos made things a little better, as we debated whether it actually had any alcohol in it (yes, it did). we all ordered off the restaurant week menu. my grilled shrimp appetizer was tasty...3 huge nicely seasoned prawns on a skewer with a spicy corn salsa. my pork chop second course was horrible...toughest piece of meat ever. seriously. it tasted microwaved. this is the first time ie ever sent anything back to the kitchen for fear of the special sauce, but after 2 bites, i couldn deal anymore. the waitstaff was very accommodating about the situation and a guy in a suit even came by, apologized and replaced it with my requested chicken entree...again, tasty, but not spectacular. i ordered the chocolate cheesecake dessert, which was fluffy and not too sweet, but reminded me of ordinary chain restaurant buffet mousse. i tried my tablematesdesserts as well...the peach pecan crumble with vanilla ice cream was weak (what the point of al a mode if the crumble portion isn even warm?), but the lemon pudding cake with mixed berry compote was excellent. the rest of us regretted not ordering that option. don know if this was an off night, or the kitchen created a low budget/low quality menu for restaurant week, or if the gloomy weather somehow un-inspired the kitchen staff...based on the hit-and-miss quality of the food and the inhospitable first impressions by the hostesses, i not sure i go back., I went here because it was in the hotel we were staying at and i got to say I was highly disappointed.One morning we wanted to stop in for breakfast and the hostess asked us if we could wait 15 minutes even though there were plenty of tables opened. They said that there was only one waiter and that person was tryiing to get the orders in. After saying we would leave the hostess let out a big sign and said she supposed she could take or orders. We opted out and left.We eventually made it in for breakfast. The menu was very limited and very disappointing. Everything was ridiculously over priced for not that much bang for your buck. I had the arts omlet which was okay but no original flavors for $14.On another day we went in for dinner, which was another limited menu with hardly any options. I had the salmon. The pea risotto was bland and flavorless. There was nothing special about it and a bit mushy. The salmon was over cooked. The bread served with the meal was cooked in a tiny skillet and flipped onto a plate. Only one is provided for the table and nothing else.Really this restaurant is more hype than anything. I think its highly over priced, there is hardly any options of good things to eat. I suggest you go somewhere else., I had pretty much the exact same experience as Emily M., in fact we ordered the exact same meals. I came for restaurant week, with the hopes of experiencing the delicious tastings of Chef Art. This place fell flat during the entree, and really wasn much better during the other parts of the meal. Okay, so we all started with some cocktails before the apps arrived. I ordered the margarita (it literally said perfected), Il admit, I was sold when i read the words margarita perfected. Granted I was not at a mexican place, but figured what the hell. It was terrible, seriously seriously terrible. The other cocktails that were ordered were pretty bad as well (pinky swear and fruity punch...or something like that). I started with the arugula salad, which was really good, not anything special, but really good. The fried chicken dish was NOT GOOD. It hurts me to say this, Ie been watching Chef Art on Top Chef Masters, saw him in an interview on CNN, I was so excited to taste his food. Then I did, and then I realized it crap. The chicken was tasteless, the biscuit was unusual, it was a really condensed sort of doughy texture. The gravy was okay, it definitely helped make everything taste better....then they had straight up rubber vegetables surrounding the meal...I guessing the were going for al dente, but wound up with rubber. The pecan peach thing I had for dessert was by far the best thing served for dessert at the table. After saying all this, I will say that the service was great. The waiter seemed to know his wine and recommended a very decent bottle. His only fault was his recommendation of the pork chop that my buddy ordered, which was just plain awful. It was overcooked and tasteless., Went for RW. Nice atmosphere and much more casual than I anticipated. Yes, you can wear jeans. Started out with melt-in-your-mouth cornbread. I had a delicious arugula salad, salmon with pea risotto and the peach cobbler/crumble. Two thumbs up for the pea risotto because I dont even like peas and I liked this. Creamy without being overbearing. Peach dessert was just average. Salmon was nice but nothing amazing. Fellow diner had mac and cheese that was divine.DO NOT order the pinky swear cocktail- fellow diners all agreed it tasted like Robitussin. Service was incredible-perfectly attentive without being intrusive. Id return., In order to get a Restaurant Week reservation, I had to stalk the Open Table website to get a good reservation. Every date I tried said there werent any openings within two weeks. Until I realized that reservations go out only 30 days in advance. So when I found out the last day of RW was outside of that window, I made sure to check the website as soon as I was within 30 days of 30 August. And so my reservation was made.After a very long venture to find the restaurant, we finally made it to Art and Soul. From the outside, it looked very modern and hip. We contemplated sitting outside, but I was worried about sitting and sweating, so inside we went. I slightly regretted not sitting out there as the sun set and it looked enchanting outside, but the inside was spectacular as well. I wanted to take the light fixtures home, the booths that lined the perimeter of the restaurant looked small and cozy, and I loved the artwork, especially the giant portrait of Barack Obama on the other end of the restaurant.When it came time to order, I had such a hard time deciding. Salad or shrimp? Ravioli, salmon, or crispy trout? After musing for what seemed like hours, I finally settled on the Capitol Hill Salad, Crispy Trout, and Peach Pecan Crumble. J got the Soup of the Day (beef something), Chicken, and Lemon Pudding Cake and added the Pantry Hoecake for an extra starter.Everything was so good. The capitol hill salad was such a delight. I loved how light the dressing was but still full of flavor. The bread was light, flaky, and the hint of herbs really made it special. It reminded me of a Pillsbury biscuit or croissant, except, you know, a thousand times better. Js hoecakes were also awesome. They were like pancakes covered in fris39e, blue cheese, and a very light vinaigrette. It was a combination you wouldnt normally think would go together but was deliciously good. At this point I decided the rest of my meal would be awesome. I was so excited about everything I had eaten so far, that I knew the trout would be delectable.It was sort of disappointing. It was good, but I guess I was expecting so much bang in my bite, but it was only mediocre. However, I still liked it enough to bring home my leftovers. J enjoyed his chicken and I stole a bite of his goat cheese biscuit. Now that was good!Art and Soul redeemed itself with dessert. I wasnt a fan of Js lemon pudding, but the pecan cobbler was amazing. I love the combination of sweet and crunchy with the vanilla ice cream.Overall, the food was amazing. The service was great. our server was fantastic and attentive. He answered any questions we had with the greatest of ease. He even noticed our table was missing a candle (J and I joked we had no romance because of this) and not only gave us a candle, but gave us one in a bigger votive holder. Even more romance! hahaI really like the ambiance of Art and Soul and love that its tucked away by Capitol Hill. It provided for a great post-dinner walk under the city lights. Its also reasonably priced that we can come back when were in the mood. J is eyeing the fried chicken. When I had my trout leftovers yesterday, I was reminded of what a fantastic and magical night I had with J and at the restuarant. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves some good home cooking for the soul, with a slight creative twist., If you want to end your meal pissed off with free food this is the place. Hands down the worst service Ie ever experienced. My wife, son and I came here for brunch today (saturday morning) and were really excited about Chef Smith restaurant and even more excited about it being restaurant week. My wife and I ordered from the restaurant week menu and my son had a turkey burger. The turkey burger was tasty and the pimento ketchup was delish. My wife salad was also fresh and flavorful. My appetizer was the grilled shrimp which had a VERY fishy smell and taste.  I like to set up the scene for the remainder of the meal. The restaurant was practically empty, there were maybe 6 other tables being served. Here where the meal continues to head down hill (started with the fishy shrimp). After the initial arrival of the beverages, our waiter did not ask us if we wanted anything else until we ended up walking out. At one point my wife managed to hail a different waiter, very politely asked if she could have a refill on her coffee and got no response from him. She again politely asked if she could get another cup of coffee and the waiter looked at her and said I heard you. Which, I think was a pretty sweet thing to say. Our appetizer plates were bussed 30 minutes after we were done with them (with still no offers for refills for the drinks) and finally after waiting 40 minutes for our entrees, putting up with a rude waiter and an absent one we had enough and stood up. We called over the manager and told him we happily pay for what we ate, but the wait was ridiculous and we didn appreciate the missing waiter and the attitude from the other one. To their credit they insisted in giving us our entree along with some small treats for free. We both ordered the fried chicken which was spicy, crispy (even after we drove home), mine was juicy but my wife was dry (though Il chalk that up to eating it 20 minutes later) and the mashed potatoes were ok. Someone needs to shake up that staff because its sinking this ship. Will not visit again., OK, after watching Top Chef Masters and loving Art Smith, I was really looking forward to this dinner. The food for restaurant week was good - the bread was nice and buttery, the chicken corn chowder was perfect comfort food, and the desserts were a nice finish to the meal. Unfortunately, what was lacking here was service. We asked three times for additional bread and finally got it on the fourth try. We had no refills on our drinks. They took forever to bus our plates and serve us our next course. They got our desserts wrong. All in all, the service was just plain slow and thats why I only give this place 2 stars., Art Smith you make me sad!I had high hopes about Art & Soul--per recommendations from friends--and despite the up/down Yelp reviews, I thought Id give it a shot but I was sadly disappointed.Restaurant Week was still going on so I thought Id take advantage of that and then order some things off the regular menu.Me: Caesar salad/ stone fruit pork chop/chocolate cheesecake shared the caviar hoecakeBF: Grilled shrimp/fried trout/pecan crumbleThe hoecake was really sour and you couldnt distinguish any flavors, save for the caper berry...it was a mushy mess.The Caesar salad was fantastic with white anchovies, a whipped yolk hard boiled egg, perfect dressing and it had a good mix of lettuce varieties.My BFs shrimp were great; no complaints.From here the dinner starts to crash and burn.My pork chop was huge and terribly overcooked...I could barely slice into it...literally.I had to send it back and after I did this, I noticed another table send their pork chop back as well.The meat I did manage to eat was bland and incredibly tough.The waiter asked if I wanted another but I opted for the ravioli instead--equally disappointed--the broth reminded me of the lemon ointment my grandmother uses on her feet yeah, it was that gross.The ravioli was covered in sad looking, wilty vegetables--fail.My BFs trout was good--crispy, salty but it was also covered with the same wilty vegetables. Dessert was awful.Pecan crumble was cold and soggy and my chocolate cheesecake was a cross between jello and mousse. Just a really sad dinner., We really had our hopes up for a memorable experience, but given the recent reviews of Art and Soul I suppose we shouldnt have been too surprised with the outcome.Just like Ive read in other reviews from two months ago, we were told by the hostess to wait a few minutes after our reservation time due to there being just TWO servers... You would think competent management would fix staffing issues affecting the restaurant on the timescale of months! After 10 or so minutes a waiter made it to our table and we ordered: Fried Chicken and Natural Benedict. The biscuit in the benedict was delicious, however one of the three pieces of chicken was cold while the other two pieces were lukewarm. To their credit they brought me a new plate yet the chicken was now overcooked to leave no doubt about the temperature. We ordered a side of the macaroni casserole which was great, but couldnt quite redeem the experience.Id give the food a 3 to 3 1/2 stars for the hit-n-miss experience we had, and the service was decent when they actually showed due to being so stretched. Management, get on it!, Went for lunch -- since i was alone they put me at the bar which I dont mind. What I do mind is essentially be treated as a second class citizen which means -- no refill until i asked, bread brought after i had finished my bisque, no spoon for the bisque (i used by tea spoon), generally slow service although all i had was bisque and a salad. One other person was at the bar and I noticed she received similar treatment. As for the food, the crab bisque was good but not hot enough and the waiter did not ask whether i wanted the soup or the salad first. I was halfway through my bisque before i could get the waiters attention that i wanted salt and pepper. All in all not a great impression, Wow, what a transformation! What had previously been the baseball themed Senators sports bar in a dowdy Holiday Inn, is now a hip new restaurant full of Washington glitterati. The interior of both the hotel and the restaurant reminded me of a Kimpton (think of a cross between the Palomar and Helix).As for the food, the hoecakes were not at all what I expected; more like crepes than the anticipated cornbread. I chose the lamb hoecakes which came with feta, cucumber and onion and were very reminiscent of Greece. In addition to the many pork products you might expect on a southern influenced menu (the braised pork shank and black-eyed peas was like an upscale version of pork and beans), in a nod to the Chesapeake region, in addition to their Bay fry (do they really have squid in the bay?), they serve a rockfish which came with a very tasty (and spicy) Chesapeake jambalaya, the exterior of the fish seared to crispiness. OK, the names are kind of silly, but the food itself is very good. As you would expect, the wine list skews American and there are some bargains to be had, including a couple of Oregon Pinot Noirs for under $50. Extra props for having a small, but excellent selection of regional draft beers, including Duck Rabbit, Victory, Penn and Dominion products (they are currently doing a special Oktoberfest menu on which each course is paired with a beer).Portions here are not small, so Art Smith signature dessert, Baby Cakes (miniature cup cakes) is a great way to end a meal, split between two or more already-sated diners (there are five per order).All in all a great addition to the DC dining scene., BEST fried chicken I have ever had!!!!Seriously. I have had good fried chicken but nothing that was as perfect as the Sunday night Family Style Chicken. The shrimp appetizer was ok, the hot bread Chris loved, I was eh on it.But the Chicken served on mashed potatoes, with sausage gravy and greens has be craving more. The outside whas crunchy ever with gravy on it, the inside was so moist and juicy. I want to figure out the secret because I would love to recreate this at home.This was a last minute hey where should we eat and it was great., I am not sure what happened with this restaurant in the past, but whatever it was, its been fixed.My friend and I came here after arriving in DC. The hostess was nice and pleasant, and seated us right away (we had reservations, and we came right on time). The waitress was friendly, knowledgeable, and had a fantastic sense of humor. Also, the manager (or other host?) came by our table and spent some time with us talking about DC, the food, and of course, Art Smith. His name was Ian and he was an absolute doll. (nice, informative, and cute to boot! :) )For food, I had:* The Salmon and Caviar Hoecake. Absolutely amazing, the consistency of the cake was like a smooth cakey pancake, topped with a yummy white sauce and the salmon. The caviar and salmon paired perfectly together and with the hoecake and it was DELICIOUS.* Caesar salad, which was fantastic. Perfect amount of dressing (not drowned in it), yummy croutons and a couple anchovies. Mmmm mmmm....!* Blackened Scallops. FANTASTIC. They had a *slight* kick to them but it was in no way overpowering or overspicy. Some of the best cooked scallops I have ever had, and the presentation was wonderful.* Chocolate pudding cake. Very tasty, interesting (but yummy) consistency, truly something between pudding and cake. Very decadent, definitely order this to share. Not a big fan of the sugar thing on top, but it was easy to set aside.To top it all off, Mr Art Smith was there and came by our table to say hi. It was simply the icing on the cake that was a fantastic dinner experience. This restaurant - and Art - did not disappoint.I cant wait to visit DC again just so I can eat here!, The ambiance was great! I enjoyed the food, and the staff was very attentive. I will definitely plan to visit again soon., I will be back to Art and Soul for the fried chicken, the amazing cocktails (get the Country Kool-Aid...seriously, drink the Kool-Aid), and the incredible Spring Pantry hoecakes (this dish incredibly combines beets and grapefruit and greens for a final dish that rivals fried chicken...remarkable). But what really has me salivating when I think about this restaurant are the Fried Green Tomatoes. Now, I grew up in a very, very small town in California in the Sierra Nevadas where Southern food was tacos and burritos. Nary a word of green tomatoes, let alone frying them, were spoken as I grew up. Then, I moved to New York City and lived a mere few blocks from the famed Dinosaur BBQ. I had fried green tomatoes there, and thought they were decent. By this point, I knew southern food was something different from the cuisine from that great country to the south and that if a movie was named after a dish, it had to be better than decent. I had the fried green tomatoes at Arcadia, and loved them. Clearly, I was still a beginner and did not know what love was. I do now, it is Art and Souls fried green tomatoes with remoulade. And Art and Soul does not skimp on the love, no, you get a whole basket of it. If you go to this restaurant, engage in some self-love and eat a basket of fried green tomatoes., My friend Michael D. also reviewed below, and to echo him, whatever the problem was before with this place, it has definitely been corrected.we arrived for our (I beleive) 8pm reservation and were greeted by the smiling hostesses and seated immediately.Vicky, our waitress was all smiles and completely knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered a pitcher of blackberry mojitos and we were off!!Appetizer was the salmon hoe cake, which we split, sooo yummy and presentation was on point.Capitol Salad - Apples, bacon bits, bleu cheese, and a really yummy vinegarette dressing.... WOWMain course was pecan crusted chicken, served with some sort of super delicious stuffing and vegetables.We also were brought a side of the baked macaroni, and oh my god it was soooooooo good. (maybe because it was compliments of the house) but it doesnt matter, we thought we had died and gone to heaven.Dessert for me was a flight of cupcakes -- carrot, vanilla, chocolate and I cant remember the other two flavors...at this point I was so deleriously full from the HUGE portions, that its all a blur from this point on...A nice cappuccino, and that was a wrap. I dont think I could have possibly eaten another bite of food without exploding. The highlight of the evening tho, was Art himself coming to our table to see if we were enjoying ourselves.What a WONDERFUL experience! Definitely will be back!!, My advice is to avoid this place or lower your expectations. I was excited to try it as I love southern inspired food and also food. The place is nice enough inside and I cannot complain as the service was for the most part excellent. The food was just not very good at all. The hoe cakes were not my cup of tea, but maybe that is just me. Apps were alright but did not justify the price. The main courses were a disaster both the pork chop and the fish were very overcooked and flavorless. I was very disappointed, maybe it was an off night but I doubt I will ever go back., This upscale restaurant, at the Liaison Capitol Hill Hotel, is beautiful. Its not far from Union Station. I tried the chicken and waffles. Although the chicken was cold, it had a great flavor. The waffles were pretty good. The coffee was excellent. I tried some of my friends fried oysters, and they were delicious.**Insider tip: request a booth-for-two when you make your reservations., i had the shrimp appetizer, salmon, and apricot pecan dessert thing...it was ok. the shrimp was pretty tough. the salmon portion was huge. like almost golden corral style huge. it was well cooked though but not necessarily spiced well. the problem i had was with the pea risotto stuff under the fish. it was gross. sorta like baby food...and disappointing because i love risotto. the dessert was equally underwhelming. i liked our waiter though. a lot. i doubt i would ever go back. even for drinks. the bar was sorta cramped and a bit stuffy., Very nice decor with good upscale soul food. Cocktails were nothing special., Went there for brunch and had the farmers breakfast ($19 - also part of breakfast). thought it a little pricey for what it was - nice eggs, bit of fruit, but pork sausages wayy too salty and potatoes were a bit cold. My wifes chicken was cold (as per another reviewer, despite the plate being hot - whatever they are doing to try and keep the food warm, it aint working). Decor was modern and nice enough, but it did have a part-of-a-hotel feel. Service was good. Outside area on the sidewalk looked nice., I went with a large group and had only a main course (while others ordered starters), and it was a business dinner, so I didnt get to eat from others plates and get a fuller experience. I liked my shrimp, the ambiance was fun, and diners seemed to have a good time. Ill try it again., I wavered between giving Art and Soul 4-stars or 3-stars. Finally settled on 3-stars since I just think their entree prices are too high for the overall quality of the food. But I wouldn hesitate to recommend this place to friends; especially if youe a comfort food lover.Let start out with the decor. The restaurant is about a year old at this point and the interior design is gorgeous. Very modern, colorful, and art deco.The staff was also very friendly and courteous (although just a bit slow at certain times). We had to ask our waiter for the special, but he thanked us for reminding him and handled the mistake very graciously. Water was generally refilled very quickly and everyone meals were brought out at the same time (something Bourbon Steak never managed to master).Moving on to the food... While Il get to specifics in a second, everything was generally very good. But at $28-$32 an entree I expect excellence on those dishes which is ultimately why I rank Art and Soul at 3-stars. Here what we had:Complimentary Bread: Warm, buttery, and delicious. When they ask your table if you want a second piece, the answer is yes!Chesapeake Bay Fry Appetizer: Large and satisfying; but not very memorable.Pork Ribs Appetizer: Tasty, but sauce overwhelmed the pork at times and the dish was served partially cold. Note: This plate is a little messy to eat!HoeCake Grilled Lamb Loin: Really, really good. Generous portions for a first and the feta and tomatoes complimented the lamp and flatbread nicely. Recommended!Rockfish Main Entree: This was described as a spicy dish to us but I found the piece of fish itself, while fresh, to be somewhat bland in taste. The accompanying jambalaya and tomato sauce helped a bit; but not enough for me to recommend this dish.Braised Pork Shank Entree: Every part of this dish tasted very good; but the sum of the parts just didn gel to me for whatever reason. Maybe it just me, since I enjoyed the pea stew, spicy greens, and pork enormously on their own. But when mixed, I found the combination uninspiring.Maple Glazed Grilled Veal Chop Entree: Delicious! The sweetness of the glaze matched the light biterness of the brussel sprouts perfectly. And the veal chop was large and well cut. Highly recommended!Fried Green Tomatoes Side Order: Excellent; just as described. But make sure you don go overboard on all of the fried food if you want to leave the restaurant upright!Macaroni Casserole Side Order: Heaven in each bite. You must order this dish if youe a macheese person!Baby Cakes Dessert: We split one of these dishes for the dessert three-ways since we were very full. This was a great end to the meal. The apple and pumpkin cakes were particularly good.All in all, we left Art and Soul full and happy. But with an $80+/person bill (including drinks, tax, and tip), we really expected to also leave wowed. And Art and Soul just (barely) didn deliver in the above and beyond category. Still, I wouldn hesitate to come back or recommend it to a close friend.P.S. Joye tip to reserve a booth for two is a good one if youe on a date!, Went there with a big group for a friends birthday party. Service was good and the food was good too. I got some steak dish which was good...not great, but the appetizers and the bread made up for it. My friend asked for the fried chicken and waffles for dinner and they made it for him. Looked great and he said it was good too.3.5 stars, but you know the Yelp scoring rules!, If you want to bring in the new year with some delicious food and beverage, this is definitely the way to go. I shared my new year dinner with my wife and another couple. The menu was a fixed price, four course meal. Between my wife and I we sampled, a walnut-apple-fetta salad, deviled egg, a meat-mouse served on a hoecake, (pancake) chestnut soup, lamb hoecake, ahi, prime rib, grilled pork chop, chocolate cake and a citrus tart. They also served a packaged up pecan sweet roll intended for breakfast the next day--tasty. Everything was absolutely delicious. One friend that accompanied us was vegan. The wait staff went out of their way to accommodate. Though it was humorous when they served him a deviled egg and some cheese. The meal lasted from about 7:45 at our seating to a little after 11:00 (which I suppose was intentional for the holiday). The ambiance was very swanky with retro fixtures and furniture. Special for New Years Eve, they brought in a DJ. On the whole, the experience was fabulous, punctuated by delicious food and the most courteous of wait staff. The shocker came at the end with a $430 bill for four. Of course this was largely due to the Holiday (meals $80 each and drinks from $10 to $20 per drink) Regardless, the high price did not ruin the nice evening. I am fairly certain their regular menu is much more comparable to a middle/upper restaurant in DC (expensive, but not bank breaking). The clientele attire ranged from jeans and collard shirt to suits and ties. The restaurant was located on the first floor of the liaison hotel. There was a nice lounge in the lobby with a full bar menu, ideal for waiting to gather a group. I highly recommend for a nice evening out!, So disappointing. I wanted to LOVE Art and Soul. We went for NYE dinner, and while I aware this is one of those overpriced evenings at almost every restaurant, when we got the bill for this food - we were furious.We started with the Boudin Hoe Cake/Deviled egg amuse bouche. it was actually ok, but really nothing special.for appetizer my dining partner and i chose a salad. the salads were fine, nothing special but not horrible.for second course we had fish and lobster pot pie. these dishes were ...ok. my point here is that the dishes were not inventive, not especially outhern not anything memorable which is what i would expected from a 90/person meal. the fourth course is where i got mad. the waiter raved and raved about the pecan crusted chicken. in the back of my head i thinking it chicken, chicken is usually the same everywhere. but i go ahead order it. big mistake. it chicken. no, it not overcooked but ie had much better chicken at a handful of local peruvian establishments. and the special pecan crust? was more like pecan slush, room temperature gooey, not crunchy, just really unappetizing. the apple sausage was ok, but i paying this much for good stuffing? the dessert was the final straw. a chocolate stout cake with almost as much flavor as cardboard. almost. the only positive side to this dish was the chocolate wafer that sat on top. additionally, when i paying for my 90/meal, albeit i no square, but i dont want to have to shout at my dining partner over justin timberlake sexyback. baad choice, art and soul, overwhelmingly loud club music is not condusive to an enjoyable dinner.what really infuriates me is that i could have paid $5 more a person adn gone to minibar. which would have been phenomenal. looking back, if i had known how bad this meal would be, i would have gladly paid the additional $35 and gone to Komi where I would have been in a gastronomical wonderland.don go to art and soul. this whole experience makes me not even want to try the regular menu. this restaurant, unfortunately, is overpriced and all hype., Well done, Art and Soul. After a long day of playing tourist - it was lovely to get off of my feet and enjoy a really pleasant meal.This is a lovey, quiet space - though I don really get the inedible nuts as table decor. . . my dad kept looking for a nutcracker. The hoecake starter was very good (imagine a savory pancake with toppings). My scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I ate everything on the plate.For dessert, we had a killer caramel-chocolate cake and a Meyer lemon tart with quince preserves. Outstanding! Our server even brought us over a tasting of baby cupcakes to make up for the fly my brother found in his water (yes, literally, my brother had to say waiter, there a fly in my water!)*I left the restaurant feeling full and content. Excellent service, good food.*Normally I hold any bug-related incident against a classy restaurant, but really, this could happen to anybody - and the waiter handled it with incredible speed and tact., Did a dinner with girlfriends tonight. After a long drive downtown and terrible traffic, it was really nice to get out of my car.. and into this quiet, pretty space. We had early reservations so we got to check out the happy hour crowd at the bar while waiting for friends. At first, I got the feeling that they really weren going to seat us until our entire party had arrived. That was a little annoying. However, once we sort of pressed the case that we were ready for dinner and would start with appetizer etc.. we got seated. After that the experience got a lot better. Our waiter Raphael and our hostess (Ms Grant, yes same last name as me) provided us with impeccable service. Very attentive, yet not intrusive to a bunch of girlfriends out on the town having a good time. Both of them went the extra mile to provide a warm and friendly dining experience - from the beginning of dinner to the Il get the valet to get your car before we even left the table with our coats on. My dining partners all ordered the bisque for starters.. and all I heard was a lot of oooo and ahhhh as they ate it. I on the other hand completely fell in love with the ahi tuna. Seared to perfection and served over the crispiest little fried green tomatoes with some sort of relish/chutney stuff on the bottom. Fabulous.For our main courses - the pecan crusted chicken - which is a specialty of the house - salmon cooked to perfection and seared scallops that, even though they could have had a touch more seasoning, were cooked perfectly as well. I ate every bite - and the sweet potato mash left me definitely wanting more. I could have had a happy pile of that on my plate and been very satisfied. We got servings of yummy hot cheesy macaroni and cheese for the table along with roasted veggies and more fried green tomatoes - those really were great. Light crispy coating - fried but not at all greasy. They were definately a hit with me. For dessert - we had banana bread pudding that really didn live up to my expectations - but the cheesecake was a hit with everyone who tasted it. All in all I a fan. Again, I LOVED the service - and the food left me happy and contented. Be warned, dinner ain cheap - and for comfort food I felt it was just a tad pricey (hence the 3 but not four stars) but if youe up for a good time and a really nice venue - it a great place to go., Art and Soul, where is your art (both in decor and culinary speaking)?! I came here for lunch for restaurant week and was not too impressed. This was the day that I decided to break my vegetarianism and transition into the world of pesco-vegetarianism. To start, I ordered the capitol hill salad (mixed greens with apples, pecans, and apple cider vinaigrette). I asked the server if I could have the salad without the blue cheese and she wasnt sure if the salad could come without blue cheese. This seemed odd to me as I would hope that the restaurant freshly tosses their salads and thus, can subtract or add the blue cheese quite easily. When the salad came it was overdressed. My salmon was good. I liked the braised cabbage and beets. I thought the vegetables complimented the consistency and taste of the salmon well. However, my dining partner said his hanger steak tasted too much like hamburger meat. The desserts were okay but nothing memorable. As a bread pudding fanatic, I naturally got the banana bread pudding which was good but nothing memorable. My dining partner got the almond cheesecake. I thought it had too much almond flavoring.The service wasnt that great as well. When the main course was served, there was about 10 minutes that my dining partner and I were sitting without a knife to eat our food. How did the server miss making sure that we had utensils?! Also, when we asked her what benton bacon was (allegedly this delicious type of bacon from Tennessee), she didnt really know and said it was local. Servers should know the menu dishes in order to sell the food to the customers.I thought the place felt a little too detached for a name like art and soul. We sat in booth entirely covered from the seats to the sealing with stuffed ivory tiles that reminded me of an insane asylum. Next time, Ill pass., Art & Soul has a lot of things going for it and some things it needs to work on. The pros: great atmosphere- we got a quiet secluded booth that was very nice especially considering it was restaurant week. Fried green tomatoes- best Ive ever had- they were crispy and full of flavor- awesome. Banana bread pudding- one of the best desserts ever- I was blown away at how simple and amazing this dish was. Crab bisque- very very good with nice chunks of fresh crab. The bread- the complimentary skillet bread is fantastic! Im very glad they give you as much as you want.The cons: the Pecan Chicken- it was mushy and half of the vegetables were a little al dente and nice and the others were mushy and over cooked. The price- I was a little shocked at the prices considering the type of food you are getting. Chocolate cake- very mediocre and dry.Overall- it was a fine restaurant week choice but I will not be returning to pay full price. Maybe Ill stop in for the tomatoes and dessert though., overall, w really enjoyed our experience at Art and Soul. we drove in to DC from NoVA and the drive down New Jersey Ave to the restaurant was incredible - hello Capitol dome!one grip - we got to the restaurant 30 minutes before our reservation and were told no problem, give me a few minutes and we can seat you. my fiance and i went to the bar to grab a drink. i ordered a glass of the white house wine and my boyfriend ordered a bud light. our bill was $17! totally ridiculous. the beer was $5, which is fine...but $12 for a glass of house white is insane.the restaurant itself is very nice. big open windows, decorated in black, white, and red. we got a private booth towards the back of the restuarant - very cool. it was restaurant week, but we ended up ordering off the regular menu. and we were there on a sunday so we had to get the family style fried chicken!the chicken was cooked perfectly. crispy and flavorful, and we got two pieces of white meat and a leg. definitely won leave hungry. the chicken came with mashed potatoes (very standard, but necessary) and greens (i not a fan of greens, so i can judge these). we also got a side of fried green tomatoes (best i have ever had! amazing!) and the mac and cheese (so cheesy, tastes just like my grandma used to make).for desert, we split the apple fritters. they were like perfect little donuts with a bit of apple inside. and the dipping sauce was superb. i could have drank it alone.the meal was just what i would expect from Art Smith from seeing him on tv. it was down-home cooking, done perfectly.
4|birch-and-barley-washington|Got turned away at the door, because upstairs was to packed. Guess Ill try again some other time., Why would you review a place you didnt go to? Anyways...This place deserves a lot of credit for the beer selection, alone. It boasts 50 taps and 400 or so bottles. Thats impressive. Twice as impressive is the delivery system, known as the beer organ. Its a gorgeous set of wide, copper pipes that run from the upstairs keg room to the taps. Its the centerpiece of the downstairs dining area and is sheer genius. I got to the place a bit too late for dinner, so I sat in from of the beer organ and ordered a drink. Low and behold, they had Founders Canadian Breakfast Stout, critically acclaimed as one of the 10 best beers in the world. No one has Canadian Breakfast Stout. No one. I really says something that they were able to snag some kegs of it. Aside from this, the service was harried and it was obvious that it was opening night. I have very high expectations for this place and cant wait to try it once theyve smoothed out the act, a little., This place is awesome. Huge beer selection, and great food. This neighborhood needs more nice restaurants, and Im glad to have another one so close by. Huge beer selection, amazing ambience, and reasonable prices. Id recommend this place without reservation., I checked out Birch and Barley on opening night last week. I went upstairs to the bar and met up with a friend. Its a nice atmosphere- a little dark, but cool. I love the long bar- it allows for a lot of people to be there. The beer list is extensive! Its great to see a place with so many beers on tap. I was a little confused though as to why they only had partial menus- maybe theyre still getting the rest ready? Prices werent outrageous either- the lower end was about $5 going up to $12. You can have smaller tastes too which is nice option if you want to try several beers. I had a great pumpkin ale- Im partial to seasonal drinks. However, mine was served at room temperature. Not what I want for my beer. But it was good. Ill be excited to go back on a week night after the hub-bub dies down. Its a nice new spot, but I dont think will be a favorite., We came at 9:30 last Saturday night and there was already a line at the door because the bar had exceeded their 250 person capacity. Pretty impressive for an opening weekend! We only had to wait a bit, and once inside, had a great time. This place has all the right ingredients to become one of the most popular bars in the city. The beer and wine menu is massive, and the bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable about the drinks. It reminded me of the beer menu from Brasserie Beck (but cheaper) with the ambiance of Cleveland Park Bar and Grill. I didnt try the food, but it looked pretty similar to what you might find at Bourbon in Adams Morgan.Ill definitely go back., First the good: Birch & Barleys beer selection is amazing. One of the things we liked best was that you could order all of their drafts in 4 oz. glasses, so you can try a few and figure out what you like before you commit to a full sized glass. If you ever went to Dakota Cowgirl, the spaces previous occupant, youll be pleasantly surprised at the night and day difference in decor and atmosphere. B&B is beautifully decorated and not overly noisy.We had dinner reservations for four and found the service to be very good. One of our beers came in a chipped glass that was quickly replaced. Our server was attentive but not overbearing. The one thing that I thought was lacking, however, was the food. Their bread was good and baked in-house. The appetizers were also good (I had the seared octopus). The entrees were very average though. The vealneck sausage flatbread was salty and lacked depth. My friends all ordered the burger and found the prosciutto (which we assumed was ground into the patty) to be vague or non-existent. It was all very edible, but not outstanding. I would definitely go back to Birch & Barley for drinks, appetizers and desserts, but I didnt find their dinner to be anything special., The Good: The most impressive thing about the place was their beer selection, which has got to be one of the very finest in the city - too bad I was there to eat and couldn care less about fancy beer. We were seated promptly. The restrooms were clean and pleasant.The Mediocre: Menu was smallish, but Il admit, I found compelling several of the choices therein. Food was a solid good but not exceptional. Service was decent, but unremarkable. Decor surely had a certain charm, but I wouldn go farther than that.They did have an interesting bread presentation but, frankly, considering how long the food took to arrive, and how little of it there was of it when it did, I would have greatly preferred a traditional basket.The Bad: Pricey with small portion sizes - I left hungry. The kitchen was also VERY slow, and we waited an hour for our entrees. The quality of the food, while decent, was not enough to compensate the negatives. By the time the check came, I was anxious to leave.Final analysis: Unless youe into sampling lots of beer, this place is respectable, but nothing too special. It one of those places that I don regret going to once, but it left me with little desire to return. If you have an appetite, move right along, or bring a gigantic wad of cash., I couldnt decide whether to give Birch and Barley a 3-star or a 4-star rating. I went with 4-star because I would consider the restaurant this if they change the menu fairly frequently--I would tire from the current menu after a couple of visits.Ill get to the point.Birch and Barley was A-Ok. The starters and entrees that my group had were very tasty. I had a beet salad and a burger, and I left quite sated. My friend ordered the scallops and bass, and while the scallops were a starter and the bass an entree, if he had not ordered both he may have departed a bit hungry.The service was just decent. At one point I dropped my knife. I looked behind me and asked a female employee if I could have another. She nodded and walked off and I never received a new knife. Im not sure that the girl spoke English so I wasnt too irritated. However, my waiter eventually brought me one.Keep in mind, the restaurant is quite loud. This meaning I had to raise my voice in order to be heard.The bill, for three people (three drinks, three entrees, a side and a starter), totaled $110--$135 with the tip.Overall, I would consider going back,, Was here last Saturday and really glad to have a solid new place in the ood. The room is great -- converted garage, high ceilings and lots of wood -- and the staff is really earnest. We got off to an awkward start when the hostess tried to seat us side-by-side at a banquette. When we expressed a preference to sit facing each other, she said, We were hoping you would sit this way. The manager came up swiftly and intervened to tell us we could sit however we damn well pleased. Thank you!After that it was smooth sailing. A hipsterish-looking dude came up to personally pour my sidecar out of the cocktail shaker, and it was nearly perfectly made (no sugar rim). Appetizers (apple and fennel salad, polenta with mushrooms) were delicious and light. Entrees (duck breast and flatbread with prosciutto and figs) were delicious, though the duck portion seemed a little small and the flatbread isn so much flatbread as pizza. Overall I recommend this place and plan to go back., Had an awesome meal at Birch & Barley a few nights ago. Before even getting to the food, our group of 4 spent a good twenty minutes just trying to figure out which beers to choose from the crazy beer list (50 on draft, 500 bottles, and 5 casks). Eventually, we decided on four appetizers: Arctic Char Tartare, Seared Sea Scallops, Polenta, and Charred Octopus. All were great, but the tartare was the standout dish of the bunch thanks to the freshness of the fish and the nice flavor brought by the kitchen use of yuzu. The scallops were another favorite, both because the scallops themselves had a nice sear without being overcooked or rubbery, and because they were served with a creamy Israeli couscous and cauliflower puree that I would have gladly eaten a bowl of on its own.We then split one of each of the Seconds: Beet Risotto, Tagliatelle with rabbit, Veal Neck Sausage Flatbread, and Port Glazed Fig Flatbread. The Risotto is a stellar dish - a shocking shade of purple, yet surprisingly delicate in flavor (the beet isn overpowering, even though both roasted and pureed beets are present), and finished with a scoop of whipped goat cheese to up the creamy/richness factor even further. The tagliatelle, composed of fresh pasta, succulent, braised rabbit, carrots, and housemade ricotta is another dish that shouldn be missed. Both flatbreads were also impressive, with the delicious combo of port, figs, prosciutto, and Gorgonzola just barely beating out the earthier, richer flavors of the mushrooms, Pecorino, and veal on the sausage flatbread. A few people at the table found themselves combining the side of Maple Glazed Brussels Sprouts we ordered (which were also awesome, nicely cooked and seasoned with just enough maple so as to avoid cloying sweetness) with the fig flatbread, and claimed that this addition pushed it even further over the top.And of course, we couldn forget dessert. The plate of Candies and Confections - a combo of miniature desserts, including a Hostess cupcake, an oatmeal cookie sandwich, and a walnut bar, among others, is just lots of fun - the oatmeal cookie and the house-pumpkin ice cream are definitely the best parts. Our other dessert was the Apple Beignet, a battered and perfectly fried chunk of spiced apple, finished off with cinnamon sugar and served with a cider sorbet. Both were really good, but Il have to head back if only to try their play on French Toast. Service was just as great as the food, and combined with the overall ambiance/design of the space, dinner at Birch & Barley was definitely an experience I ready to repeat. Taking into account that theye barely been open a month, this combination of winning factors is all the more impressive. I know Il be back soon to delve further into the menu, especially the entrees and the desserts., I want to give this place a 3 or 4 based on design and taste of the food, but our experience Saturday night was ridiculous. They were out of so many things that it became a joke. The menu is really small, our waitress was unfamiliar and/or overextended and distracted the whole night. There is a mystery book that took a long time to get that has their 200+ or 300+ beers, and some are more expensive then you would expect so you should check the book before you order. I asked the waitress if they had any lambics and she said no, and then when we got the book I found they had many. They were out of one of the sides, they were out of the hamburger (You. Are. A. Restaurant. Out. Of. Hamburger). They were out of some of the beers, they were out of the pumpkin ice cream, the list goes on. The other entrees (I think there are only 5 entrees on the menu) are in the twenties, I had the sea bass and while it was good, it came with barely any vegetables and there may have been a mention of polenta or grits, there was a smearing of a yellow substance and that was it. FYI - the menu on their website is not the same as the menu in the restaurant at the moment. The two saving graces to our meal were a visit from their Beer Master who was able to offer great recommendations, and the desserts. They have a great sampling of traditional desserts gone gourment (hotess cupcake, oatmeal raisin cookie, chocolate lollipop, etc.) and our friends had the french toast that was equally amazing. There was a draft the whole time as people standing in line to go to the upstairs bar (Churchkey) kept standing in the doorway. Churchkey really needs a separate entrance. The restaurant is loud, but beautifully lit. I will try it again after they get the kinks worked out., Went here last week. Overall, the food was good (but not great). For dinner we had the fennel & apple, pork cheeks, and striped bass. Nothing really stood out, though the pork cheeks did taste progressively more delicious as I drank more beer. I still give Birch & Barley 4 stars because of their pretzel rolls, chocolate peanut butter tart dessert, and awesome beer organ. Im gonna skip all the fancy stuff on my next visit and leave the place in a beer and pretzel roll induced coma., Currently the most popular place in D.C. by far.I like beer--scratch that, I love beer, but after going to this place I realized I have a lot to learn about beer. Their beer list is larger than most restaurants wine list. The food was good too. Very eclectic menu. I had a pasta with rabbit for an appetizer and a bratwurst burger for my main course. Both excellent. The flatbread is also good. Really great atmoshphere. Waitstaff was great and knowledgeable. I will go back for sho., If youre into beer, its great. Food, for the most part was also very good. Wine selection was small but thoughtful. Thats the good.Uninspired designLoudPOOR serviceTiny menu and though most was good some was pretty bad.When you only have 15 items, they should all be good.Lastly, for the neighborhood restuarant group, theres nothing neighborhoody about those prices., Came here on Saturday night for dinner. Earliest reservation available was 10:30 pm which is late but we were down for a late dinner. Great decor and waitstaff. We ordered the tasting menu. I didnt particularly like any of the dishes but enjoyed the meal nonetheless. Everything was very well prepared and unique. Next time Ill get a flatbread which I have had before at the upstairs bar ChurchKey., After first hearing about this place on a local food blog, I was itching to go try it out. After weeks of hearing good things, both about the Birch & Barley as well as ChurchKey, I finally got a reservation and went with a few friends. Overall, I had a great experience. I was a big fan of the ambiance of the restaurant and found the initial bread plate was delicious. As for the food, I agree with some of the other posts that the servings was slightly smaller than I would like, but only because Im a glutton. Though all the food was made well and tasted good, of the ribeye, bass, and the honey-glazed duck that we ordered, the duck was amazing.Other than that, it was great to have the taste coordinator or whatever their title is stop by and ask us about the beer and the food and how best to pair the two. So I would definitely give service a high mark.Overall, a must eat., Ok - I get it. Birch & Barley has a great, trendy restaurant feel. However, all the buzz about this place is not deserved....yet. The place has a very cool vibe and the selection of beer is endless. The menu choices are pretty solid. We decided to try the tasting menu - eh. Heres what we tried: Scallops - this was a good dish. The scallops were cooked perfectly and the Israeli cous cous on the side was delish. This was one of the stronger dishes.  Beet risotto - umm...this dish was weird. The flavors did not mix well together. All the elements were there - sweetness, acid, creaminess. Somehow they didnt vibe. And the flavor of beet was overpowering (dont get me wrong....I love beets but this was too much).  Duck - this dish was actually pretty yummy. I usually dont like duck but I cleared my plate.  Tar Tar - this was pretty good as well. Flavorful. Fresh.  Some kind of apple cinnamon dessert thing - pretty good. We also got a bread thing complimentary - pretty good.While the menu was good overall nothing except the duck and maybe the tar tar was memorable or outstanding. I think the restaurant has major potential - it was clear they wanted feedback and were still trying to experiment with their menu. This is a great sign - they will soon figure out what works best and hopefully the entire menu will be filled with such dishes. The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, professional, and attentive. 5 stars for the staff. I will come back to this place even though my review is only 3 stars - I think in 6-8 months they will work out their menu., Love the atmosphere of this place and tons of cool beer. The bartenders are very friendly and knowledgeable of the selections, and they will give you a tasting if you ask nicely. The food was pretty good, exceeding my expectations. The Arctic Char tar tar is very good, scallops are decent. The rabbit pasta was nice and buttery. What really puts a restaurant up to the top is having a nice bread basket. I enjoyed my pretzel roll with a nice side of mustard. The beignet wasn what I expected, since it was thin crusted and filled with fruit. I Googled later to find it German style, so maybe they should have mentioned that.It a little far from the metro and the hostess said they will have valet parking I am certainly coming back., Ok, ok the beer is great....except it really wasnt. and dont try and order anything else from the mixologist. Someone in our party ordered a dirty martini that tasted more like a lemon drop. The service and food were inconsistent. The bouncer was rude when we were trying to get to our reservation because he though we were trying to cut the 20-deep line up to churchkey. Our table got an assortment of everything: sea bass, rabbit tagliatelle, fennel salad, beet rissotto, char tartare, polenta (which never came) and complimentary scallops that came in its place. (which were severely undercooked)I know its new and hip, but the restaurant is not worth the money. The char-char and the willy wonka beet risotto were the best...(and they were only ok) This place has been open long enough not to have the problems we encountered. Ambiance trumped, food and service. No one in our party was impressed or would return. Which is a shame, because were locals and wanted to like it. Skip the restaurant, go to churchkey if you can get in., Im a fan of Titan, which occupied the upstairs of this establishment when I lived in DC years ago. Id heard that Birch & Barley gave the building a huge renovation, so I was excited to check it out. And it is beautiful - theyve done a great job.Sadly, the neighborhood feel is completely lost and I was dismayed at the B&T feeling I got from the upstairs bar on a Saturday night. Its an impressive beer menu, and everything was fine, but somehow, to me, there isnt any character behind the shiny, fancy fixtures., Definitely a great place to take beer enthusiast - with 50 beers on tap (the menu changes daily we were told) and a selection of 500 bottled beers! I went w/the 4oz glasses just so that I could sample more beers. I mainly stuck within the fruit & spice section of their beer menu and the only beer I didn finish was the Rose De Gambrinus (tastes like cough syrup, would not recommend unless you like that). They have their own pastry chef at B&B which is maybe why the bread was so good! For my entree, I ordered the honey glazed duck breast which was cooked perfectly and very tasty. Upstairs is Churchkey, which is more of a bar w/booths for people to eat and mingle. It was crazy packed when we visited after dinner. Overall, this restaurant was a fun and enjoyable dining experience. Beer, food, service and ambiance were all on point. A great place to go with a group of friends (not too big though, restaurant is kinda small). I recommend making reservations ahead of time, this place fills up fast., Do not bring a group larger than 6 to this restaurant in the winter. We were seated at the large table in the front of the restaurant, and it was incredibly cold. We were told that there was no other table that could accommodate our group of 8. All of the women wore their coats due to the freezing drafts, and the space heaters provided no relief. Management came by to apologize, but it was clear that no one should have been seated at that table when the temperature dips below 30 at night. They also charged us for the hot tea that we only ordered because of the cold temperatures. The managers should have called us earlier to let us know what our dining experience would be so that we could have made alternative arrangements. We cannot have been the first group to suffer from the highly uninsulated glass garage door front window. The food was good, and I dont think this would be a problem in other seasons. However, it was incredibly embarrassing for us that our out of town guests were so freezing at a reportedly nice restaurant. At $40 a person, we would have expected a much better dining environment., A friend and I went here for dinner when the upstairs bar, ChurchKey, was packed and we didn have time to wait (had to get home to watch the SOTU). The beer options are impressive, and not as overwhelming as I thought it might be. The drink list does an excellent job of describing the choices, and our server was very helpful and knowledgeable. While we were waiting and enjoying our beers, we were brought a trio of breads to try, with a house made ale-mustard. I don remember what they all were (I know a pretzel, something with olives, and...?), but man were they good. My companion remarked, as a server cleared a half full bread plate off another table, I don understand how they could have left any!I ordered the brat burger, a bratwurst patty with beer-braised sauerkraut and emmenthaler cheese. The server recommended the maple-glazed brussels sprouts, and having never had a brussels sprout before, I figured then would be the time to try. The burger was amazing, the fries were killer, and the brussels sprouts were pretty darn good. Birch and Barley gets 4 stars from me because they made me like brussels sprouts!, very interesting menu. dont go if you only eat chicken.love the wine and beer selection, treated VERY well by staff and chef even came out to say hey.pricey, but i say worth it when youre looking to experience something new.would definitely go again, and looking forward to it., I went here with a friend for restaurant week, and enjoyed it. This is not a place I will be going on a regular basis because of the pricetag, but restaurant week provided me with an opportunity to sample many of their really innovative dishes.The bread and apps were delicious; I got the vialone nano risotto dish which combines risotto, beets, and goat cheese, and it was tasty (I dont even like beets!). It was a really interesting combination -- I would have never put those three things together. I had a skate dish for my entree. It was very good, but as this was my first time trying skate, I decided I may not be a huge skate fan. Finally, my dessert was really good; Birch and Barleys donut and mocha ice cream was fabulous (see photo). Birch and Barley gets four stars for a very unique and tasty menu. I hope to make it back soon - maybe after a raise!, Delicious. and i dont even like brussel sprouts! The fish was very good, the wait wasnt too bad on a Friday night which is crazy. My friend had the duck and loved it and we shared a bowl of brussel sprouts. I need to try the maccoroni on sticks., I went here once for dinner and it was expensive but not otherwise memorable. But I came back for their first brunch, last Sunday, and I very glad I did. They were still working out some of the kinks (which they acknowledged, and which our very cheerful and efficient waitress did her best to smooth over), but once it is firing on all cylinders, this will be a go-to brunch destination in the neighborhood.We had donuts, which were extremely good. In fact, the chocolate and lemon-poppyseed donut were so delicious that they made the regular cinnamon-sugar donut boring by comparison. It was still a good donut, but it could have been more adventurous too. Gravlax with potato salad was tasty, but the potato salad was so mustardy (and in a good way) that it outshone the gravlax. Chicken and waffles made me finally understand why people like chicken and waffles, although it was so intense that even after splitting it with my wife I felt slightly overwhelmed. And there were easily half a dozen other things on the menu that I like to try next time.the juice and brunch cocktail menu is also very interesting-- as you would expect from a place that specializes in potent potables. My wife had a non-alcoholic pomegranate lemonade, which was pure and lovely, although she found a little boring. I had a bizarre cocktail of beer, soy sauce, hot sauce, and other bitter and disgusting things that I found intriguing and compelling and my wife found positively vile.It still isn cheap, but Il definitely come back, and have high hopes for it., Went for dinner on a Wed night. The beer menu is great, and the bread plate is a nice touch, but the food does not live up to the hype. Servers overly eager explanations & constant questions about whether the dishes were to our liking became irritating. Just a few examples of the duds on the menu: The beet risotto was OK, but nothing to write home about~ the mush of colors and a glop of goat cheese created taste & texture that was closer to porridge than a delicate risotto. The tagliatelle w/ mussels and seafood sausage sounded promising, but was over-salted and decidedly mediocre. There were, at most, 3 or 4 meats of mussel and one lone slice of what I gather was supposed to be sausage. The sausage tasted like an unidentifiable blend of cod and imitation crab meat. The lack of balance between the pasta and the seafood made the dish quite sub-par; it was hardly possible to make out the flavor of the broth. The fig flat bread was well done comfort food, although it could have used a more subtle touch of the goat cheese. All in all, for the prices, there was little sublime about the food. A local bar trying so hard to be a fine restaurant. B&B should stick to the beer & bar food menu, which it does best (such as the brat burger)., Im tired of restaurants whose only offering I can sincerely rave about is their bread. This is another one.Despite an experience at Churchkey where the food was practically thrown at us, the kitchen/service in B&B was horrifically slow -- we were there for *three* hours. Our first beers arrived 35 minutes after being seated, 25 minutes after being ordered. Courses took 45 minutes, and the birthday dessert I had arranged with the hostess (from their menu) was never communicated to the server as promised, resulting in him bringing us dessert menus and us scrambling to salvage the surprise. Thanks, dude. On top of forgetting 2 of our beer orders, were wondering what value you add. (To be fair, they brought 3 desserts and charged us for 2.)Go for the beer, definitely. The food...probably not. The limited menu aims for diverse but ends up at weird. Im not put off by yuzu gelee or fennel or pork cheeks or skate, but my companions were, and they had a difficult time finding something appealing. I felt bad for them., We came here with a big group for my bachelor party. It ended up being a great option because we really didnt want to think at all and just commence turning off our brains for the evening events. The prix fixe tasting menu with the beer pairings were just the ticket. Overall, the food was great - the highlights were definitely the grilled octopus, cheese plate, and key lime pie desert. B&B has a HUGE beer menu which was just totally overwhelming - picking the beer pairings for the tasting menu was perfect because they did all the choosing for us.With every course, the waiter does a really informative and detailed explanation of the food and beer. This led to some awesome jokes about us seeing if we could chug the beer he was describing as artisanal or arromatic before he finished his speech. Additionally, we were waiting for a food course of mozzerella sticks and accompanying beer pairing of a 3 week old Keystone Light served in a traditional red Solo cup, but that never came... oh well.This place is not cheap or fast, but for the right kind of evening, it would make an awesome and memorable (although the 7 beers we consumed made that dicey) experience., I would give B&B a solid 4 on their dinner. But yesterday I came in for their new Sunday brunch and was blown away. It was the best brunch Ive had in DC, better than Tabard Inn even (though not by leaps and bounds). To start we tried the sticky bun, variety of freshly fried donuts, and an amazing bread basket. Then proceeded to try the truffled croque madame, corned beef hash with fried duck eggs, fried chicken and waffles....They have a number of fresh squeezed juices, including the blood orange juice generously use for their mimosas. And a selection of different bloody marrys, although most of us opted for the classic. Im glad I did, it was one of the best Ive had. The best part, along with the courteous service and lovely atmosphere, is that they serve brunch till 8 pm! Ill certainly be back., We went on a Wednesday, figuring it would be easy to grab a table, and were sat in the back next to the kitchen. I really liked the setting, although I felt the plastic chairs were a bit cheap. We definitely liked 2 out of the 3 breads, the sweet bread tasted a bit stale to me. Also, I really like all sorts of mustards, however, their beer mustard was just too sour for me, disappointing. Wife ordered the Tagliatelle pasta which she loved, I had Loin of Venison which was extremely tender and good flavor. Tried to offer her a piece of it but she found it much too rare for her tastes, which I dont mind so much. I ordered it medium-rare as the chef suggests, but it definitely was on the rare side so watch out for that if thats an issue. Desert was disappointing and not memorable. It was their version of Key lime pie it just fell flat for me. It just didnt seem to have that pop that I expect from key lime. Overall it was a nice experience, but I will probably go just to the upstairs bar for a drink next time. Im a fan of all their restaurants and had not been here yet, but just a few of the items left me disappointed., Come to this restaurant when youre not hungry because the portion size wont satisfy your hunger.I had the $26 stripped bass which was about 4-5 oz. with celery as garnish. And no side items! No rice or vegetables! Im not a big person and I wasnt expecting gargantuan portions, but for $26 I should at least have a couple grains of rice with the fish. I also had the $10 carrot cake dessert, which had a carrot cake that was half the size of a Twinkie -- imagine that -- with a teaspoon of sorbet and a bite size of flan. The flan was delicious but the carrot cake was a bit dry and bland.Despite the disappointing portion size, the striped bass was well seasoned, soft and cooked perfectly. Beer was great as well. I sat next to the kitchen and it was not as noisy as I was expecting.For $80 (before tips) for a dinner for two, I was expecting the food to at least satisfy my hunger, but I left with a groaning stomach and wanting more. Im going to stick with ordering from the bar next time., Dined here with a friend the other day. We had a fun experience sitting kitchen-side on the counter that overlooks the chefs at work. An absolutely phenom complimentary bread board started the meal, as fresh-baked as it gets, with unique and very tasty items. This was followed by a shared app of their veal sausage flatbread which was very tasty. An excellent venison entree followed and did not disappoint. The playful confectionary desert was also very enjoyable.Great ambience, very lively, and modern gastronomy with generous servings of everything. Definitely a good night out!, Went here with a few friends from work after a long day. We had an outstanding time. Out waiter was Jason and the guy was FANTASTIC! Walked us through the different menu items beer and food menus made great suggestions and was good for tableside conversation.The food and beer are enough to make me go back, but the service was enough to make me join Yelp and tell others about it., I came for Brunch at about 2pm on a Sunday. The restaurant was about half-full. This was the worst service experience Ive had in recent memory. Once we were seated, our server took about 10 minutes to take our drink order. Then disappeared for about 15 minutes, no drinks, no order taken, nothing. There really was no excuse because it wasnt even busy at that time. It took about 40 minutes to get our food. My cobb salad was good...but then it took 10 minutes to get some salt and pepper to season it. The food was good (Ive had better brunches in the area), but the whole experience was tainted by the horrible service., Surprised my husband with dinner here for his 30th birthday knowing he be in hog heaven. And he was. We went on a Wednesday night and had a seven olock reservation. When we arrived, after confirming with an enormous bouncer that we had reservations for dinner, we checked in. Our table wasn ready, though we were right on time, and the restaurant didn appear full. I say we waited five minutes to be seated, but they did give us an excellent table near the open kitchen in the back section of the restaurant that is screened by this giant beer organ thing. Once seated, service was prompt. We decided against the pre-fixe and just went ahead and picked our own appetizers and entrees, asking the server to assist with pairings. The bread, as others have stated, was wonderful and warm and just enough to start.For our first course, I ordered the Blue Point Oysters and they were delicious. He ordered the crispy duck-egg; it was a riff on a typical bistro salad of lardons, frizzee and poached egg....not as good as the orignal-not enough acid in the vinaigrette and the egg needed salt badly, but it was still pretty good. At one point, the beer director came by the table and brought us each a 4 oz. pour of an additional beer selection that he thought would be nice with oysters. It was excellent....a suped-up guinness really, but perfect with the briney oysters. I think it was called Zeitgeist. We were impressed that he stepped in, but we were not impressed when the extra drinks showed up on our bill. They did take the charge off when we brought up the fact that we hadn actually ordered them. It wasn expensive, but I was mildly annoyed that I was being asked to pay for something I hadn ordered.For dinner, I ordered the duck breast with leg confit and he ordered the crispy striped bass. The duck itself was wonderful, as were the deliciously tart braised radishes served along-side. The wild rice mixed with dates and hazelnuts was nice, but a little cloy for me. Maybe sour cherries would have been a better choice than dates. Also, the beer (Malheur? I think) our server recommended was too sweet for the dish. IMO, she should have recommended a tart Belgian beer instead to counterbalance the sweetness in the dish. I didn taste the fish, but he said it was nice. The artichokes on the side were a little tough.Desert was AMAZING. I had the carrot cake and he had the french toast. Both accompanied by a delciously spicy beer that I can remember now, but it was basically a Dunkler Bock with a higher alcohol content than usual. The carrot cake was a mini loaf that came with an amazing exotic sorbet, which was essentially tart tropical fruits with cardamom, and a tiny cream-cheese flan. The french toast desert was beyond words: carmelized banana, ice cream, happiness, so very good.The server said his desert was on the house because it was his birthday, but we were charged anyway. We were too full and buzzed to make an issue of it at that point. So overall, I give it a firm four on both food and service. It was definitely a fun, engaging, and tasty dinner., After imbibing at Churchkey, we made our way downstairs for dinner (meals 2 & 3 of the evening). We got a spacious booth for the four of us. Even though they occupy the same building, the restaurant has a different menu, but share the same beer list. I opted to try their blue point oyster which came with a green apple mignonette. I started with the artic char tartare which had a great citrus flavor (the yuzu definitely came through!) For my main, I got the app portion of the seafood tagliatelle, which was good and very light. Bf got the bratwurst burger which he absolutely loved. The moscow mule drink that he got was one of the best liquor drinks Ive tasted in quite a while. Service was awesome. Our waitress was outgoing, friendly, and very patient with all our questions about the menu. I loved the decor and the use of lights and candles. Great place, though can become a little pricey., OK, this place has the 3rd leading beer sommelier in the country- yes a beer sommelier! With that said I enjoyed a LOVELY dinner for my friends birthday- a open partitioned room right outside the kitchen in the back of the restaurant. We had 16 people and a fixed menu- but that didnt minimize the impact of the service or the food! The cocktail menu is lovely which was quite nice after the semi long walk from the metro station! As far as our meal- we had a awesome beer pairing with each course! Being a HUGE fan of paired tasting menus- one with amazing beers was a nice change of pace. Our meal began with flat breads (yum) and I moved on to the scallops then duck! All beautifully prepared and tasty! The meal moved in a nice pace and was well executed by the kitchen staff and our amazing server! Dessert was an adorable mix of cup cakes, donuts, carrot cake, sorbet and ice cream . Once I move to the area- I will be sure to be returning to Birch & Barley :) Well done!!!, I had trouble with this one - really deserves 3 1/2 stars but am rounding up out of optimism.Liked: the graciousness and warm greetings from the hostesses and manager. Disliked: the laissez faire attitude of our server at brunch who would make eye contact and then look away. Waaay too busy for us.Fond of: the concept of the homemade donuts on the brunch menu: toffee bacon?!? lemon poppy?! bittersweet chocolate?! YUM!Not so fond of: the execution of above mentioned donuts. Pretty presentation, short on taste. Happy to see: the dark roast Illy coffee on the menu!Not so happy with: having to flag down the server for refills each time my cup was empty - would have appreciated a bit more attention with the coffee pot...it is brunch, after all! Creamer was delivered twice in darling wee pitchers...about 1/2 inch in the bottom of pitcher both times. Once with crumbs...not ours. Not enough for the two cups of coffee at the table either time.Appreciated: our server - prior to losing interest in serving us - asking if there were any food sensitivities/allergies/special needs the chef should be aware of.Confused when: after asking the above, was told the omelet could not be made with egg whites as the chef isn set up to do that today. Overall, lackluster service with nicely plated, decent tasting food. Bloody Marys are spicy (nice!) and the letterpress menu is gorgeous, but we weren wowed. It was the sort of brunch that you leave saying, well, that was nice... but not much more., Very good beer., AWFUL! The service just has no idea how to run a restaurant, the place smelled awful, and the food was far too expensive for what it costs. The only good part was after we complained the manager did call us the next morning to see how things could have been better...at least they are trying..., The Birch and Barley is the restaurant portion of the Churchkey bar. They feature the same excellent beer selection and hip decor.The menu was well put together, and featured some intriguing flavor combinations.I had the pan-roasted skate, a seafood I never had before (but had caught). The waiter said it was like a red meat and had recommended a smoked lager beer to pair -- great choice!I also had the asparagus salad with goat cheese, which was also quite good. I usually flinch at goat cheese -- my parents have goats and they smell like the cheese -- but this did not offend.I don know that I go out of my way to return to the Birch and Barley, but I definitely visit their upper-floor neighbors for a drink., Amazing food and Greg has done an amazing job with his food-beer pairings.That being said, everyone wants to go - you need a reservation. Also, parking is really really difficult to find so if you need parking, you should leave well in advance. Finding a spot can be very difficult. Also, the bar upstairs (Churchkey) is popular enough to warrant a serious line at the door once the evening gets going.The service leaves plenty to be desired and I would have appreciated more attention from our waitress/waiter (have gone here multiple times). Overall, food and drinks are great but not the service or the serious lack of parking., I came here with 3 friends for dinner on a week day night (this is important... Ive heard the wait here on the weekend is unbearable). The food was amazing... we had appetizers, entrees and dessert... every single item between the 4 of us was just perfect. The beer selection, as noted, is diverse. The atmosphere is very comfortable... (dark decor, open room, relaxing). I want to suggest it as a good place for a date, but the acoustics, like so many DC restaurants, are not great. Staff were attentive and we never felt rushed. The meal was a bit pricey, but I do think we got what we paid for. I found nothing to complain about., So I read about Greg Engert being honored as Sommelier of the Year, not for wine but for beer. A suggested beer and appetizer pairing was also in the article so I decided to pay the restaurant a visit and try it myself.Unless you know the area pretty well, its a bit hard to spot the restaurant at first. The entrance is too small/crowded? And customers coming downstairs from ChurchKey dont make it any easier to get in. However, I had decided that I would have a good night so I was willing to by pass this whole scene. The restaurant is lovely, the wood, the lighting and copper pipes give it a chic/slightly rustic feel... Im not quite sure what made them choose the clear plastic chairs though.Our server was very attentive and knew the menu, both beer and food, very well. We were greeted with a board of 3 little rolls each - a sage-bacon bun, a cinnamon raisin bread and a pretzel-like bread. All very good although the bacon in the sage-bacon was hard to ascertain. I ordered the Spezial Rauchbier Lager, described under smokey and then spicy and meaty which was very good, I very much enjoyed the smokiness. My boyfriend ordered the Gaffel Kolch, described under crisp and then delicate fruit. Definitely crisp but nothing to write home about at all - it felt like it was missing something to make it interesting.On to our meal, we ordered the charred octopus (since this was the suggested pairing with the beer I ordered and I do love octopus). It did pair perfectly and the dish was definitely lovely although I couldve done without the pickled eggplant. The fried capers were a nice surprise and definitely a wonderful twist on their regular texture. We also ordered Port-Glazed Figs flatbread which also seemed to pair pretty well with my beer I thought. It was nice but nothing I havent tried before - it, too, was missing something to make it a bit more interesting. Our entree definitely left quite a bit to be desired. We had the Pork Tenderloin and although the meat was ridiculously tender and well seasoned, nothing else on the plate was very good. The haricot verts were so salty that neither of us could go past the first bite. It also came with Ramps Spaetzl - I didnt feel that this was a good complement for the dish and they were definitely strange... (in appearance and taste). We ordered fingerling potatoes with bacon as a side - the bacon was nowhere to be seen (or tasted). In retrospect, maybe we shouldve tried the carrots. What did salvage our meal (at least for me) was the dessert - Peanut Butter Chocolate Tart: OMG!! So good that I had to include a picture!! It came with buttermilk sorbet (sorbet! not ice-cream - so nice!) and a whiskey-vanilla mini-shake. Excellent and so lovely!!BOTTOM LINE: although I rate it as a 3 star restaurant, I give it a 3.5 (although I cant do halves on here) on account of the service, the extensive draft menu, and the dessert. Great for dessert. If you want to try the beer (which is probably the only reason I would come back for) - try ChurchKey if you are there with friends - seems like a great place to chill., I dont see what all the fuss is about. Yes, the copper tubes that presumably deliver the beer look cool, the beer selection is great, the staff do a good job of recommending, and the bread selection was quite tasty. But, the lucite clear chairs are terribly uncomfortable and the food was just, meh. We had the charred octopus to start, and I dont know much about octopus so I cant say whether it was good or bad. However, my dining companion claimed to love octopus, but she didnt even want to finish this plate of it. We both had pasta dishes - the gnocchi and rabbit sausage (me) and tagliatelle with seafood (her). Mine was ok. The sausage was good. But, it wasnt great and I cant say it was worth the money. My companion compared hers to lipton noodles. A bit harsh probably., What does the 14th Street revolution need? More places you can casually lounge. Fortunately Birch and Barley with its upstairs bar, Churchkey, moved into the space formerly known as Hamburger Marys and Dakota Cowgirl (Fanning). Mary and Dakota were both burger joints where you could order a plethora of fried things and drink cheap. When they left, a vibe left the neighborhood too. At about the same time, the leather bar above them also left.What replaced both is a combination of neighborhood gems that raised the ante on their predecessors. Upstairs is a bustling bar with so many beer choices they needed a beer director--50 on tap and a truckload of choices in bottles. I dont think Ive ever been to a place that required a beer director. The beer menu was intimidating, fortunately a beer connoisseur sitting in front of us helped navigate us to a white German beer of which I never heard the name, but thoroughly enjoyed. It was almost like champagne. I highly recommend a few tastes. It is hard to believe this transformed bright and busy space was once a sticky hot mess filled with assless-chapped furry daddies. Ok, so that was a stereotype. I didnt see any assless-chapped daddies there when I played trivia in Churkeys former iteration, Titan... but there were plenty of assless-chapped daddies on the sidewalk on this particular occasion, in town for a leather convention and were not informed this upscale straight bar replaced their former watering hole. Only in our nations capital... It provided an added level of humor to an already sidesplitting night with my dinner companions: Jen, Monica, Ty, Dre and Mary El.But we were not there to enjoy the happy hour, only upstairs to wait for our table. When the beeper buzzed, we were directed to the front window of the restaurant, which seemed more like a glass garage door and made a chilly winter night a pseudo sidewalk al fresco dining experience. As I had a view outside, those facing me got to view a killer interior design punctuated by a number of floating lights that could have been inspired by Harry Potters great hall. Gorgeous and simple.Our spunky waitress explained the two dining options. The first, which they were clearly pushing, was their tasting menu with beer pairings. It didnt get past me that the menus were all placed tasting menu side up with the Restaurant week menu on the back. The only thing that appealed to me on that menu was the Gnocchi al Forno with tomato coriander sauce and house cured pancetta, although the figgy pudding was certainly intriguing, as Id only ever seen it before in a Christmas carol. Who knew figgy pudding was an actual dish?Chef Kyle Bailey, though, really put out decent options for the three-course price fixed restaurant week menu. For my first course, I chose the crispy polenta in a mushroom ragu with artichoke hearts and taleggio fonduta. The mushrooms were fantastic and diverse. I also tasted the vialone nano risotto which came out crimson, flavored by beets and sprinkled with goat cheese - a creatively re-thought interpretation of flavors most serve as a salad. The port-glazed fig flatbread was also quite good, but should have been described with onions. I like onions, but Jen doesnt and had to send it back.For my main course, I was between the Brat Burger and Braised Pork Cheeks. I would have loved to try a different dish given half the table ordered the pork cheeks, but I couldnt resist the description with their stone ground white grits, parsnips and pearl onions. The cheeks were by far the tenderest meat Ive ever eaten and all the flavors were delectable. Certainly a memorable dish for its creativity, but not something I need to rush out and try to recreate at home.For desert, I chose the Meyer Lemon Cream with meringue, huckleberry sorbet and basil, which was good but totally forgettable, as were the other options the table ordered including the chocolate glazed donut with coffee ice cream. Dre ordered the Tete De Moine Cows Milk Cheese with apple butter and walnuts despite the waitresss warnings it wasnt the optimum choice. It tasted like eating shaved butter.Overall, I give Birch and Bailey serious props for their creativity and diversity on their menu. For that, I can forgive the slight failures on the table. The space was gorgeous, albeit small, but inspired lingering. Coupled with their upstairs neighbor and the good service, I was quite happy with my evening., While I am about the food, atmosphere plays a lot into my attraction to certain spots. I enjoy layouts and use of space, and Birch and Barley was worthy of my attention. From the outside, it doesnt look like much, but once you step inside, it becomes a cozy warehouse diner. Little, clear bulbish lights line a brick wall, while the other side is adorned by copper tubes. The smattering of globe lights above in the dim atmosphere (even in the middle of a day) casts a moody glow to the proceedings. Id go so far to call it hip... it tries to be cool and upscale without trying to show it tried. Food is american fare; we came for a brunch and she got a sausage biscuit and a strawberry lemonade while I got corned beef hash with duck eggs and the donut plate (lemon poppy, chocolate, and cinnamon sugar) for us to share. Well, I just had Tabard Inns donuts the day before, and while that was good, Id argue this was better. Hot and fresh, each donut was fried just right but if I had to pick a favorite, it was the cinnamon-sugar donut. Not your average donut for sure. My corned beef hash was excellent... turned out to be exactly what I was looking for, and duck eggs was a unique variation that added a little more taste. Overall, a fun spot for brunch; it can get crowded though and the space is small, so a wait may be necessary., MMMMMMM! Ramp Spaetzle, mustard greens and haricots vert, all just under the most delicious grilled pork medallions(!) with an unexpected but warm and welcome spiciness to them. We shared this dish alongside a mismatched but incredibly enjoyable buffalo chix flat bread, and several 4 oz beer tasters so I could be as indecisive as I want to be. -- oh and we started with a couple little bloody mary oysters! not bad for my first oyster, but then i was happy for the tomato to disguise the oyster flavor a bit. and we ended with the freshdoughnuts - one cake topped with bacon, one lemon poppy and one choc frosted. made to order and a substantial portion ie too much for me, but great for a group to share. ---The food was great & our waiter Alex was outstanding! Its been a surprisingly long time since Ive met a waiter that had such a eloquent way about describing the indulgence you are about to partake in. I now have a vast appreciation for ramps, the rare ingredient in our main course, beyond the simple pleasure of taste I have a great story to go with it. Going back for the all-day-brunch again this Sunday, hopefully a repeat experience!, The boozy brunch at Birch & Barley is my new obsession. For $28, you get two brunch cocktails such as a mimosa, unlimited coffee or iced tea plus three doughnut holes and your choice of entree.For me, its the perfect mix. I adore the doughnuts - even the lemon poppy seed one. Im not partial to lemon generally and think poppy seeds are kind of WTF. But in the form of B&Bs doughnut, I throw these notions away. The chocolate-topped doughnut is great, but in comparison to the poppy seed and the maple-glazed with bacon, a bit of a throwaway.While the sausage and egg sandwich is terrific, for me the dish I crave is B&Bs chicken and waffles. OMG. I want some right now. Served as three, small breaded pieces of boneless breast meat, purists may complain, but it makes for easier eating on a plate packed with food. The maple syrup is laced with chunks of pecans. I adore the combination of sweet and salty.I havent been there for dinner yet so I cant yet comment.Note: reservations are a must for brunch, at least now. Its very popular. Also, the menu upstairs in Churchkey is NOT the same. Brunch is not offered., Im generally disappointed when I eat out in DC. This place was a pleasant surprise. The service was perfect...just enough attention to let you know the server was on the ball, but not too much attention that can be annoying. I had the Tagliatelli which I thought was great. My friend had the pork and loved it. I especially loved the array of fresh bread they brought out immediately (served warm), and their homemade sorbets. One of the sorbets tasted like mango mixed with some Indian herbs...not really quite sure what was in it but I could have eaten a pint of it. Yum Yum., Things that would happen if I lived within 2 blocks of Birch and Barley: (1) I would be poor; (2) I would be overweight; and (3) I would become an expert on the art of detecting a perfectly prepared lemon-poppy-seed donut -- slightly crispy on the outside, scorching hot and soft on the inside. Sadly, Ie only been several times.Birch and Barley is now safely ensconced in the pantheon of can miss DC brunch establishments. Along with Tabbard and Creme, B&B is a go-to recommendation for people visiting from out of town, parental visitations, or a big group brunch. Get a reservation at least a week in advance, as it can be shockingly difficult to get a table for more than 2 or less than a few days notice.Let talk about the food. As the attached pictures show, it just visually stunning. B&B prepares beautiful looking plates. To the extent that this is a desirable quality in a dining establishment (and how could it not be?), B&B hits this one out of the park. The taste matches the appearance. B&B isn setting the world on fire with creativity in its brunch menu, but what on there is a tremendous version of a classic. The mascarpone served with the Strawberry French Toast adds a creamy sweetness to a standby dish. The toffee-bacon donuts are... donuts flavored with toffee and bacon. It tastes like that, which is awesome.The portion sizes vary from item-to-item and some are inadequate. A asparagus omelette was more of child size portion, and the croque madame was about the size of an English Muffin. On the other hand, the chicken and waffles entree and the french toast both easily satisfy a hungry appetite. The bloody mary, summer punch, unique mimosas, and Church Key beer menu also provide excellent selections for those so inclined. The coffee and juices are fresh and delicious. If you want brunch, you 100% cannot go wrong if you go here. Another review for dinner another time..., I cant give this place 4 stars, I really want to because the food was great--but eating at a restaurant is a whole experience--and the service experienced here fell flat. I have the chicken and waffles--and they were perfection. The chicken was juicy, and the waffles were crisp. I also had a tasty side of fries. But what was supposed to be a casual brunch turned in a 2 hour meal, with at least 45 minutes going by at one point without our server checking in with us, and not being able to get in eyeshot of him to flag him down. Ill go back again if asked by others--because the waffles came though--but I wont venture here on my own again., The only reason this reviewer gives two stars rather than one is because in spite of all the problems with this dining experience, there was some good food and in the end we ended up only paying for the coffee and orange juice. For brunch, we ordered the freshly fried donuts as an appetizer- which we requested would arrive first (logical, right?). For the meal we ordered the amish hen egg omelet and the grand marnier french toast. Unfortunately, the omelet came out underdone and also came with onions (not listed on the menu and not disclosed by the waiter when asked). The omelet was returned but didnt come out much better (albeit the onions were removed this time). The french toast was great, but did not come with the bacon the menu promised. In sum- the chef needs to make sure the food reflects the menu and the omelets could use improvement. Sadly, it will be a while before we try Birch & Barley again for brunch., Birch and Barley is one of my favorite restaurants in my neighborhood and possibly in DC. The ambiance is very nice, the service is good and the food is excellent. I have taken visitors with very discerning palettes here. One of them described her duck breast as the best shes had since she could remember. The lamb and risotto are also delicious. The bread board is awesome.The only negative is the volume level - it is hard to maintain a conversation unless you are practically sitting in each others laps., Dinner at Birch and Barley was great. If I could give half stars I would up this review to a 4.5. We had a reservation on a Tuesday night and were seated immediately upon arrival. The noise level was a little loud and made it hard to hold a conversation, but the meal made up for it. Our waiter was fantastic. He was patient with me and my lack of beer knowledge. He selected three great and different 4 oz beer tasters for me. He was also very helpful in guiding our food selection and describing the dishes. The bread tray was a great start to the meal. My friend and I shared the Shrimp Cocktail Appetizer. The shrimp cocktail was ok but nothing memorable. I will probably order a different appetizer next time I go. Our entr39e was delicious. We both ordered the gnocchi and rabbit sausage since our waiter let us know that it was the last night it would be on the menu. I a little disappointed that I will never have a chance to order it again. For dessert we had an assortment of cookies and confections. Everything was very tasty but pretty rich. We weren able to finish everything. Overall, I was very happy with my meal and experience at Birch and Barley. I will definitely be back., My date and I ordered the chef tasting menu ($55/per person) with the beer pairing ($22). The food was not excellent but very good. The beer pairing was a nice change for me, however, my friend thought that the beer with the tasting menu was just too much for her. She only drank half of her beer. I will definitely go back but will pass on the tasting menu and beer pairing., I just dont get how this can be such a tough reservation. I guess I had high expectations, but this place is so average. Food was ok not bad not good just ok. i even asked the table next to me what they though, maybe I missed something, they had the same feeling I did., Went on a Saturday night w/o reservations. I wasnt optimistic but the restaurant bar was open and we were happy to dine there. Its got a very nice feel. A great spot for anyone who appreciates a draught beer. Very nice staff and the good food served quickly (maybe too quickly.) I also liked the bread bites before dinner. The place is a bit dark. I found it very challenging to read the menu in the lighting, but it wont keep me away.
5|blacksalt-washington|Retail seafood market in the front, upscale seafood restaurant in the back. The food is outstanding--creative, well-prepared and delicious. The starters and small plates offer a better bargain than the main courses; you could assemble a fine meal by combining a number of these. Close to Chain Bridge in the Palisades area of DC., Jeff Blacks done it again (Addies, Blacks and Black Market), tack another one on to the roster of good restaurants. The first time I came here the fresh seafood, oils, sauces and spices being sold at the front - like a fish market would - confused me. Although, it all looked gorgeous and super fresh. The restaurant itself is cool and modern. It seems a bit loud back there so I always opt to sit out front at the bar. One of my girlfriends purchased a house in the neighborhood behind, and with few choices around, we frequently wind up here for dinner and cocktails when Im visiting. I order the mussels - since they offer 5 different preparations, you can never get bored. The crabcakes are also a solid choice. The only thing I think they lack is more of a selection of non-seafood items. As for the wines, I think its a great list and I love that they sell half bottles (and a good selection of them), but extra points are scored for serving wine in varying pour sizes by the glass, choose between four or seven ounces. The service is always very friendly whether its the fishmonger or the bartender. This neighborhood really needed a place like this!, Being from New England originally, I am an absolute snob when it comes to seafood. So, when I say Black Salt is good, I mean it!Making reservations is the way to go. We had reservations and we had to wait about ten minutes, but that was not a big deal. It gave us a chance to go to the bar and I was going to get a glass of wine but one of my friends is a big Cosmo girl so after I saw her martini glass, I ordered one as well. Yummy!Order the mussel and mushroom appetizer. Not sure where they get the mushrooms for this, but seriously- they are the best. I ordered the rock fish for my entree because I saw it was from Maryland and why order something from say..Alaska at a local buzz worthy place? It was excellent. Try to save room for the Key Lime pie-- it is the best I have had outside of Florida.I was tempted to grab some fish at the market on the way out, but I was way too full to even think of my next meal., Seafood is fresh, oysters are sweet, and one of the best mussels I had! plump and sweet and all cooked to perfection, not any one of the mussels was shriveled or rubbery.We enjoyed:Chesapeake Bay oysters on half shellAddies blue shell musselsMaine Day Boat scallop cevicheCrispy Virginia soft shell blue crabBangkok seafood stewWhole Mediterranean bronzinoKey Lime pieThe sauce for Addies blue mussels is heavenly, the lemon and tomato brings out the sweetness in the mussels, the shallot gave nice subtle onion flavor without overpowering the overall flavor. The ceviche is less sour and spicy compared to those I had in Peruvian restaurants, but the rich flavor suits my palate better. And what is there not to love about soft shell crabs? lightly battered and crispy, I only wish I had more of it. Bangkok seafood stew was again flavorful but without the heat which I was surprised given most Thai food are much intense in flavoring. But the more subtle taste did not take away the richness and freshness of seafood in the stew. The salmon in the stew is lightly crispy on the skin side and sashimi-grade-melt-in-your-mouth texture on the inside, fabulous! The whole bronzino was skillfully cooked, the only thing is that I didnt know it had Parmesan cheese mixed with collard greens stuffed in the fish, and I just dont like the taste of Parmesan, but thats just me. The key lime pie is a perfect way to end the meal. Overall we had a great eating experience, the staff is knowledgeable about the seafood, the service is extremely friendly, the seafood is fresh and flavors are skillfully rich and complex; I would definitely come back when I revisit DC., We went to this beautifully designed seafood restaurant/fish market/bar last night, which was Father Day, so we couldn get into the restaurant without reservations. Instead, we sat in the cafe area next to the bar, where you can still order from the full menu. It was definitely one of the best meals, if not *the* best, Ie had in DC. Mind you, we don go out to higher end places very often here, but Ie been to enough fine dining establishments in my life to be a fair judge.The fact that you can actually purchase fresh fish, crabcakes, and the like from their market makes this place relatively unique and, in my opinion, gives them more credibility. The bar area looked like a nice place to hang out and have a drink, which maybe six or so people were doing around 5:30 pm, when we arrived. The staff were attentive and courteous and the bartenders were chatting with some of the patrons, which was nice. The table next to us had brought their toddler, who very cutely was leading her mom around as well as some teens from the next table... the place is upscale but not stuffy in this way. You can get a 3-course tasting menu for $65 each; every person at the table has to order it, though, so we decided to just have appetizers and entrees so we could have our choice of items. Since I was with my husband and sister-in-law, we shared tastes of each other meals, all of which were superb. I had a Maine Lobster risotto, which was delicious, although perhaps a tiny bit over-truffled for my tastes. Also, it seems the portion could have easily been made larger, considering that risotto is not terribly expensive. I often avoid salmon in restaurants because it is something I can make at home, but the salmon here had a fabulous smokey/salty flavor. My husband rockfish was also very richly flavored and crispy on the outside and was a nice portion.With a bottle of wine, our total for 3 people was about $160 before tip. For us, this is a very nice place for a special occassion. If you don have a car, it would also probably be a challenge to get to., This was a pleasant surprise. I had heard varying reviews from friends- everything from loved it to completely overrated. And after eating here myself, I can see both sides. Obviously, there is a dynamite selection of fresh fish. Lots of stars for that. And many of the preparations let you taste the subtleties of the different meats in interesting ways. But a few of the dishes (think Thai Mussels) suffer from heavy sauces and over-spicing. Il be back, and Il recommend it to friends. But be careful what you order- stick with the simple preparations., Went there in October to celebrate our anniversary and had a wonderful experience! We tried making reservations a week ahead, however the main room was pretty booked for the weekend. So we opted to try the new tasting room which had only opened up 2 weeks earlier but had decent times available. So glad that we did!After being escorted past the main dining room and walking through the James Bond-like wine vault doors, we were seated at our table in the tasting room. Simple decor - white walls, some exposed brick, and modern accents. Loved the deep set fireplace on the back wall. The food was excellent and super fresh and the service was incredible. The tasting menu described what the chefs selections were and what appetizers and entrees we could choose from. Everything was so good. Save room for the creme brulee if they have it. Will definitely be back for more!PROS: fresh seafood, restaurant supports sustainable fishing practices, great atmosphere (aka not stuffy), something for everyone (market, bar, main room, and fine dining), no metro accessCONS: Need advanced reservations, pricey but worth it, tasting room was a little noisy from the AC units but still much quieter then the main dining/bar area., My boyfriend knows his fine dining. After being courted as a summer associate and working at a law firm for over 2 years now, I think I know a thing or two about fancy food too. We went to BlackSalt for my birthday in November 2007. Everything on the menu blew me away. The Black enterprise (Black, Black Market, etc.) knows exactly how to deliver a fantastic restaurant experience. The seating was intimate, but casual. The servers are incredibly attentive and knowledgeable. The food is extraordinary in its creativity and perfectly blended savory flavors. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. The location is a bit out of the way for anyone relying on public transportation, but it worth it for special occasions. This was one birthday I will not soon forget - thanks in large part to the experience of BlackSalt.One more piece of advice - BlackSalt has a whole list of stews on the menu that probably rotate. I was turned off by the term stew and completely regret it. The seafood stew that my boyfriend ordered tasted as if it was crafted for Neptune himself (if the king of the sea ate his own kind, which seems quite possible)., I love good seafood, and I notice lately that I am willing to pay good money for it. Blacksalt is one of those places. One thing that pops into mind right way is freshness. The restaurant is within a fish market itself and fresh seafood is delivered and cooked everyday. My b/f & i came here for his bday. I treated (^_^). We heard from friends it was a good place to eat, plus I would see the restaurant reviewed in all sorts of DC magazines. The place is smaller in the inside, you dont need reservations.. you can eat at the bar or wait for a table (theres only about 10 tables available). If you do make reservations, you can also eat at the Chefs tasting, where they give you this 4 course meal- Havent tried that yet. Will go there again for that next time. The service was great, we got a great waitress. She was really friendly, knew what she was talking about and offered great suggestions. The dinner crowd was of the older population- with their barbara bush hair and fur coats. It was a bit initamidating. But we definitely didnt receive any down casting looks or you dont look like my general crowd that im used to serving, so i wont pay you any attention. We got the complete opposite.The mussels are great. We got a mussel salad. For a dinner of 2, our waitress said ppl usually order 2 appetizers and 1 entree and share amongst themselves. We did that, our entree was halibut cooked/steamed so it was sooo nice and soft. & it was somehow stuffed with spinach- YUMMY. To add to that, our waitress overheard us discussing my b/f;s bday. (Hes all about low-key... no celebration) She gave us a complimentary dessert with candles and happy birthday frosting. Love. It., Update 3/4/08: i am crushed. simply crushed. blacksalt took the squid ink risotto cakes off the menu. i woulda eaten that squid ink with a spoon...bathed in it, even. im sitting shiva until further notice. (sitting shiva for seafood!! ha! my father, the rabbi, must be so proud!)xoxo,miss penny laneOriginal Post 1/23/08:Although most people think of BlackSalt as a fancy restaurant, it is actually a great neighborhood haunt! We often drop in to sit at the bar for their amazing mojitos (with rock candy on a stick!), oysters on the half shell, squid ink risotto cake, tuna tartar, and mussels. When family comes to town or there is a special occasion, we make a reservation for dinner in the dining room. This place NEVER fails to impress, and everyone is super nice.Dont forget that they also are a fish market--restaurant quality fish for not much more than what the gross Safeway next door charges.xoxox, I have to admit, I had high hopes but was a bit underwhelmed. The service though really good was a bit slow. However they did make up for this by bringing our group of 8 a surprise amuse bouche when our entrees were taking too long. I think Id like to try it again and order differently. My husband and I shared a beet and arugula salad which was wonderful and simple and really showcased the fresh ingredients. We also shared a salad of arugula and shaved beets with deep fried whole anchovies. Now I like fresh anchovies. I cant rave enough about a little place in Vernazza in Cinque Terra that has the most amazing fresh anchovies EVER. But these....they were fishy tasting...too much so, kinda took the joy out of the dish for me. For an entree he had the tuna with cranberry beans, etc. and really enjoyed it. I had the whole Bronzino which had WAAAAAY too much going on. First it was a whole fish which I love and simple preparations often do it justice. But, this had a stuffing of sauteed chard with parmesan and I kid you not about 17 cloves of garlic too many. WAY too garlicky. Then on top there was a salsa with feta and roasted peppers and capers. There was another reduction sauce (I think balsamic??) drizzled over everything and then there was a quinoa pilaf that the fish was resting on. WAY too complicated. Honestly I wouldve been happy with the fish, some sauteed chard on the side and maybe just the salsa. You could hardly taste the great bronzino for the other 15 flavors going on. For dessert we shared a butterscotch pot de creme which was a little too liquidy...usually pot de creme is fairly firm but this layered version of the dessert was a bit odd. Tasted good, just didnt seem to be executed quite right. Anyway, Id be willing to try it again...but Im definitely sticking with more simple dishes/preparations next time. The fish market up front looks great. I definitely want to come back to check that out!, This review is for the bar and happy hour only. Happy hour at BlackSalt is Mon-Fri 4-7. Drink specials: $5 champagne cocktails; $6.50 vodka martini, $4 Williamsburg Alewerks IPA, $12 Henriot champagneFood specials:$0.50 Chesapeake Bay Oysters - I polished off a dozen of these badboys$1 jumbo shrimp cocktail - I had three which were very good$6 sweet chili glazed shrimp$9 PEI mussels in a choice of broth - I had the Spanish-style which is chorizo and tomato. So, so, so good. $7 crispy calamari - lightly breaded, has a salt-and-pepper flavor to itRun to BlackSalt if you love oysters - cant beat the $0.50 price tag! I highly recommend the mussels as well.The service at the bar was the best Ive had at any bar. Typically you expect having to flag down the bartender for everything. Not here, we were waited on, they checked up on us, responsive to our needs, our plates were cleared in a timely manner. The bartenders were knowledgeable not just about the drinks but about the food.I overheard a conversation between the bartender and another patron. You can bypass the menu and pick an item from the fish market for the chef to prepare. Theres a choice of a simple preparation and a chefs preparation. I cant wait to come back for dinner., I never even knew that any restaurants existed in this random little Foxhall area around the corner from the French Embassy- so Im glad I followed a few recs and sought it out!Yes the food is fabulous, but the other piece of the equation that will keep me coming back is the warm friendly, neighborhood atmosphere- all while still maintaining a very upscale but non-pretentious feel. I enjoy the decor- particularly the way the restaurant is set up with raw bar and market in front and small intimate seating area in the rear. The service itself is also impeccable.To start they have a really awesome drink menu, and an extensive wine list- so if I lived a bit closer I think I might stop in for drinks at the raw bar on a regular basis. Now, Im not a huge oyster fan myself- but everyone Ive ever been with raves about the fresh deliciousness of the oysters. Other than oysters, theyve got a lot of delicious small starters- my personal favorite being the butterfish- WOW- the preparation is melt in your mouth and accented with the perfect flavors. Something else thats truly special about this place is they always seem to have two or three seafood stews on the menu- which Ive never really encountered before. Now although Im not huge into the mussels, squid side of the house- Ive had tastes of these stews and they are worth taking a chance on. Last note- the desserts are also something worth mentioning. Ive tried every one on the current menu and I think the Key Lime pie is the absolute best. I also highly enjoy the coconut/banana cream pie and the peanut butter crunch cake. I would probably skip the hype around the Caramel Pot de creme...nothing to write home about., This restaurant is worth the trek out MacArthur Blvd. The creativity in the food is really authentic creativity as opposed to the over thought menus that have become a norm for good restaurants. It one of the places that as a group you should decide on a number of dishes to split. There nothing better than getting a taste of everything. I would suggest ordering (if they have it) the Hawaiian butterfish. The fish is succulent and not overly seasoned. I a sucker for scallops and would not be a good judge of them. I found the ambiance to be great for a restaurant that is touted like Black Salt. It is not overly stuffy, and feels more like a neighborhood establishment than most places of it supposed quality. My only qualms would be that our server was overly chatty, to the point where it was best not to look at him or ask any questions, and even in doing that he hovered to long for comfort. I think that the best thing about a seafood restaurant like this is the ability to go back again and again and explore the menu. There are lots of interesting items that deserve your attention., This is an instance of a place where all the yelp reviews are going to pretty much say the same thing. The place is awesome, so Ill just try to highlight some information for someone who has never been.1.The restaurant is a storefront in a row of stores on MacAuthur, on the right side if you are headed west (coming from downtown). 2.The best thing on the menu is the Tuna- but nothing is bad.3.The oysters are awesome EXCEPT for the Chesapeake Bay ones which honestly were awful - at least the one I ate and the one my girl ate. This is the only reason they dont get 5 stars btw.4. Its $$$$ here but honestly seems less expensive that alot of these super good/nice DC restaurants. 2 people, bottle of wine, Oysters and Entrees $150 with tip., My daughter took me to this great restaurant after seeing the Yelp reviews. The waiter was an excellent server and fun. I had Branzino with Quinoa and an excellent sauce. It was fixed perfectly with the whole fish cooked and eyeing me. The Turnip salad was excellent also with just the right amount of a special dressing. For desert I had the Chocolate Peanut Butter Crunch which was enjoyed by all. We had a nice table in the back which was round and great for five of us. There was some kitchen noise which they could work on eliminating with a better curtain or door. We had a great view of the kitchen staff working which was fun., If you go to a picture dictionary and look up the word willpower, you will not see my picture as an example. If you look up the word she-devil, you will totally see Karman L.s picture. Of course, she will be sportin little horns and a tiara at the same time.I just started to change into my running gear when I got a text message asking if I wanted to go to BlackSalt for oysters. Without giving it a second thought, I said yes. What? Wasn I just planning on running?She picked me up and off we went. When I first walked in, I noticed the beautiful fish on display in the market portion of the space. We made our way to the bar and sat down. We discovered, with mild disappointment, that the .50 cent oysters were all sold out. Bummer! However, our server talked to the manager and asked which of their other oysters could be sold at a discount to compensate for the shortage. We ended up getting 2 other kinds of oysters for a dollar each. One name escapes me, but the other oyster came from Rhode Island; it was a Umami (I think). We ordered 3 of each oyster.Service was top notch; I couldn have asked for it to be any better.The bread basket was wonderful...there were three types of bread to choose from, along with a dipping oil that was equally nice.Kudos to BlackSalt for finding a way to make us happy!!! I can wait to come back and try their dining room some time., Eh...so so. Not worth the trip if you can get to Hank or Hook. Waiter was the best part - and most memorable. The market inventory was looking pretty droopy even on a busy night. Probably more fun for happy hour than sit down., Ive been in DC for nearly 10 yrs and only just made it to Black Salt the other day. Tucked away on MacArthur Blvd among shops and restaurants, Black Salt is a fish market + restaurant. Their daily, fresh selection of fish is featured on the menu, along with the regulars. I started with a clam chowder, which was very hearty with lots of veggie and meaty clams. It was a little more seasoned than I am normally used to, but it was still very delicious. My husband got the scallops, which were very good, and our friends got the mussels and the butter fish. Butter fish, hands down, was the winner among appetizers - cooked to perfection, crisp on the outside and meaty. Two of us got the stews (cant remember the names) which were good but perhaps similar in their broth to the mussels, so I wouldnt get them back to back as appetizer/main dish. The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable, and the ambience is nice, with dark wood floors and walls that lend to a cozy setting. Theres a room in the back that could be used as a private dining area, complete a fireplace, which Id like to try next time., **3.5 stars**Oysters were FANTASTIC....kushis were my favorite kind and to be honest, this was the best part about the whole dinner.We ordered multiple appetizers to try to sample a variety of seafood.tuna tartare - very good, however the tuna was a little bit too smooshy for me..and the rice cake underneath it had an interesting textureclam chowder - seasoned well. not a big fan of bacon...so i didnt really enjoy the bacon bits in it.... the chunks of battered clams were delicious though. scallops - first time ive had quinoa actually...not too bad. a little bit under seasoned for me.Baby octopus - very good, again, nothing very unique or spectacular about the taste though.Overall, the food was good, but nothing impressive that stood out in my mind. Oysters were amazing...Id definitely come back just for the oysters..Between just my friend and i.... one bottle of red wine....half bottle of white wine and a kick ass mojito later.....what was i thinking? ??? i never did make it into DC to party that particular lovely night.... yeah......, Other than the lights being way too bright for my taste, this place was great. Casual but not sloppy casual. Some diners were in jeans, and others were a little more dressy, but no jackets are needed. At 30ish, we were some of the youngest customers. I think I saw about 2 couples our age. The rest were older couples or families. We started with a batch of oysters (can remember which kind), which were very fresh. In addition to the standard cocktail sauce and lemon, they were served with some sort of vinegary red-onion sauce. The anchovy flat bread with hummus was delicious but tiny. Like, the size of two Saltine crackers. Same goes for the smoked-salmon pierogies. Three is such an odd number for an appetizer. Couldn they at least give us an even four to make it easy? Not that I was expecting huge portions at a place like this.I had the Arctic char for my entree. Perfect sized portion. I a pretty hearty eater, but for all my complaining about the portion sizes, after splitting two appetizers and having a couple pieces of bread, I couldn even finish it. SO had no problem polishing it off. The fish was cooked perfectly and served over finely shredded brussell sprouts (sort of like coleslaw texture) and pancetta. Heavenly. Char itself is kind of bland though. I never had it before and I prefer a stronger fish.SO had the rockfish served over chorizo-based sauce. I say based because we didn see any actually pieces of chorizo, but I could definitely taste it and chorizo was mentioned in the menu description. Again, awesome dish.Since wee more of the boozehound variety and not so much winos, I can speak to the wine list, but SO plain old martini was mixed well and I was thrilled to have a margarita that didn taste like icky sour mix. We shared the chocolate peanut butter crunch cake. The name says it all and I sort of wished we had each ordered our own, as full as we were.Service was great, from the hostess to the servers and bussers. BlackSalt is kind of out of the way in this residential area but totally worth it. I overheard the diner next to me (tables are really close together) order something from the market out front and tell her server to prepare it in any way the chef wanted. I definitely doing that next time., As soon as you enter the restaurant you see the little market where they sell fresh sea food. I however did not get a chance to see what else they sell there. If you are there then you MUST try they seaweed salad. Funny thing is , I went there not for their seafood but just for a nice breakfast and ordered poached eggs but I am sure their sea food is great. I did try my friends salmon and broccoli and it tasted good. The fish was moist and cooked right , not tough or flaky at all. I love the layout of this restaurant. While sitting you can basically see your food in process in the kitchen as it has large windows. Now the service ! TERRIBLE! SIMPLY TERRIBLE. I felt rushed when the waiter was taking orders and the place was not even packed. As a matter of fact there were barely any people. The service over all was very slow., 2.5 stars, Not 3.underwhelming. seated us 1/2 hr after reservation. so many words on the menu i did not understand. so many weird combinations of ingredients that just sounded so unappealing. so many ingredients i did not appreciate. anis? blech. fennel? blech. really, none of these entrees sounded good to me. i ended up ordering the skirt steak. yes, steak at a seafood place. it was ok. but why put blue cheese on top of a steak? blech. tons of fat on it, which was gross. the chocolate peanut butter crunch cake was good, but very rich. couldnt finish it. also, it was SO LOUD. yes, it was a saturday night, but it was SO LOUD. the bigeye tuna tartare was good. i dunno, maybe this place just isnt for me... or maybe i came on the wrong night. oh yeah, and they also kept handing the wrong people the wrong dishes which was annoying., Seafood Paradise on Earth.My best friend took me to BlackSalt for my birthday and it was the perfect treat. We both ordered the scallop entree and were blown away by the perfectly cooked, juicy, flavorful scallops. We also shared the tuna tatare appetizer, which was delicious. The rice coating underneath the tuna made the perfect mix with each savory bite. We also shared the artichoke appetizer, and were pleasantly surprised. I have never been so delighted with artichokes and may never be so delighted again. No words can do justice to those artichokes. For dessert, we had the peanut butter chocolate cake, which was sublime, but large. Thank goodness we split it with three people. There were no reasonably priced glasses of champagne, which was a let down, but the champagne cocktails were delicious. Another problem was that my friends brother was not a seafood fan, and there were not many options for him. The only non-seafood entree was a skirt steak, which ended up being delicious. Would I got to Blacksalt again?Of course!!!This is one seafood restaurant that will always be at the top of my list. Now, if I only could find other people to pay for me to eat here..., 3.5 starsI really like this place for raw clams and oysters -- and a glass of wine (they have a pretty good wine list by glass and bottle)-- well attended to at the bar, with a decent size pour (plus they will do half pours) -- and the soups are very good as well., If you like your seafood fresh and prepared perfectly and youre wallet is big...Blacksalt is the place for you!, The Black restaurant group has another winner here. We had a fabulous birthday dinner for five. The restaurant took our reservation for a special occasion to heart and put us at a table in the back with a great view of the kitchen that was surprisingly quiet thanks to the glass doors between the dining and cooking areas. They also provided specially printed menus and a surprise dessert for the birthday guy. The food was outstanding all around. Fish so fresh it might have been swimming minutes before cooking. Go and enjoy!, This place is top notch. Fabulous concept, decor, fish is devine, even brunch was fabulous. Mussels are overpriced though they have so many variety of preparations, I can make some kick ass mussels myself at home, just knowing it costs them less than 5 bones to make it... well, anyhow. I had the cod a while back, the scallops, butterfish, the curry stew too. everything just lovely, but I get so drunk on wine (great wine list!), I cant remember much but that we were reveling over the food and left very happy. I still remember the lovely southern gent who served us, so sweet. Desserts are also very good, crunch cake and key lime pie stand out. The fish market is also convenient to where I live, my hubby buys softshells here and they pack them up with lots of care, wet newspaper and all. (I dont like living things in my fridge but man, they were yummy once he did the deed), *Restaurant Week Review* Oh Blacksalt, how I wanted to like you. And you took me in with your fish counter and truffle oil, your garlic-y mussels starter and affordable fresh oysters, your freshly brewed ice tea and your solid truffle chocolate cake with a raspberry coulis, your sleek modern lines and your cloth hand towels. You almost had me. But I will not get over the fact that your otherwise helpful server recommend the pasta of the day- cod over a serving of parpadelle with radiccio, brocoli, pancetta in a spicy sauce. It was awful. And the three servings sizes of awful our group got were indecently disparate. And I got the smallest serving. Look, I love parpadelle but this so-called-parpadelle was overcooked and chewy. Was there leftover pancetta, radiccio, and brocoli left over from last nights dinner? And was that Siracha sauce?! True, the cod was nicely cooked- Ill give you that. But the rest of that entree was a slap in the face., They had a great brunch, attentive service, and cool deli in the front. I would definitely come back., I have to admit my surprise when I walked in and the first thing I saw was a fish market. But no fishy smell at all. Restaurant Week is what brought me downtown from Gaithersburg, MD and I found Black Salt a real find. The menu offered more than 2 choices for each course, which I loved. From first course to dessert, all was delicious. I wish I had time to try their coffee...thats usually my final test to finish off a good meal. The wine sufficed. Ill definitely make the drive to give dinner a try., I very much enjoyed my recent lunch at Blacksalt and definitely plan on making a return trip! The calamari was among the best calamari I have had anywhere, as was the key lime pie for dessert. I dont eat much fish, so I had a hamburger for lunch which was, surprisingly for a seafood restaurant, really delicious! Unfortunately it was served with these fried, greasy potato chips, which was unnecessary. My boyfriend had a seafood stew type of dish that had a delicious sauce for dipping bread in. Overall, we really enjoyed the food here, though our server was a bit snobby and slow. But we will definitely be going back regardless..., Excellent source of Louisiana Crawfish tailmeat to make your etouffees. For a South Louisiana expat, I was not disappointed...the crawfish were actually from Louisiana! Never, Never, never, never, buy the Chinese stuff. The price per pound was around $15 which is more than the Chinese brand but it was worth it. The Chinese brands purge their crawdads with some type of chemical process which takes away from the natural flavors and makes them rubbery. The Louisiana tails produced a mouthwatering aroma in my etouffee. Also picked up some shrimp that were fresh, ie, heads were firmly attached, eyes were black, and heads didnt have huge black spots...Ive been had at other markets ., BlackSalt is simply amazing. Lets start with the back story; I dont care for fish. In fact, until recently I really did not like fish. That said, the servers at BlackSalt are very accomplished at making recommendations for dishes that I really, truly enjoy. Additionally, the younger guy that tends the counter is amazingly helpful making recommendations (especially for me, someone with fussy eating habits). But watch out for the older guy that tends the counter (he may be the boss???), he has zero patience for customers. His recommendations eventually are pretty good, but you leave a bit annoyed.Dont miss the orange mocha for dessert., I went for restaurant week lunch...they served dishes off their regular menu and it was absolutely delicious. Addies Mussels were simply amazing. All the food was very tasty and the service, if a bit slow, was very friendly., We went here last night to celebrate my mother 50th birthday. Not knowing what my mother schedule was going to be, I was only able to make the reservation earlier this week. The only time slot available on a Friday night, 9:30 pm. This place is popular! Unfortunately, even though I specified this was a very special occasion, the only table we could garner was a table in the middle of the floor which proved to be very noisy. Maybe the booths are reserved for 100th birthdays.I will restrict the review to my selections. Appetizer: I opted for the Addie mussels. Despite the press promoting these rope cultured mussels, I was not impressed with this dish. I love mussels, but these mussels were just okay. The broth was pedestrian if not a bit acidic. I can name several Belgian beer bars that have better fare. Entree: I had the red curry stew. The salmon was perfectly prepared with a lovely sear. The shrimp was good. The squid was few and far between. That was disappointing; indeed, I only counted 4 small rings. The shiitake mushrooms were good. The salad was spicy and delicious. And the broth was sweet, complex, and very good. Individually the parts were well executed. As a whole, this was a little bit of a mess. It felt like a dish worthy of a world-class restaurant executed by a chef without that capability. And at a $29 pricepoint, I would certainly liked to have seen more squid. Dessert: I had the butterscotch pot de creme and a glass of grappa. The dessert was just okay. The main ingredient was clearly milk. The butterscotch did not resonate throughout the dish which seemed odd. As such, it not a dish I will likely remember.My mother dessert was the banana-cream pie. Unlike another reviewer experience, this was not complimentary. Though it was nicely presented with a candle, and the words Happy Birthday written in chocolate sauce on her dish. Service: functional and adequate, but not exemplary in any way. For a $236 dinner, I felt the quality of the dishes and the ambience of the restaurant should have been much better. My mother was disappointed. In this price range, there are world-class restaurants available to choose from. This is not one of them., I will start with a 4 star review, but may bump it up to 5 if the restaurant meets my expectations. The seafood market here has the best fresh seafood. We gotten halibut, scallops, tilapia, shrimp, red snapper, and arctic char from here and it was all great! Even one time they were low on scallops and the fish monger went to the restaurant and took some of their scallops to meet our demand!They also carry many other good items such as the spicy seaweed salad, great French butter, and amazing blueberry cookies. If you enjoy cooking seafood, buy your fish from here. Just great., Went here with my mother-in-law to celebrate her 50th birthday. First thing to notice when you enter the restaurant is the fish market which has power to make you salivate already. The restaurant was crowded which I suppose is quite normal for a Friday night in D.C, the staff was nice enough to offer us a table before our reservation time of 9:30 pm, which I welcomed very well since I was already starving.I ordered to start the clam chowder soup, and it was just OK. I had better before.My entree was the wood grilled rainbow trout, served with braised greens and ceci beans. the fish was absolutely delicious, a little salty but worth eating it. But I did not like at all the beans and the greens; what a waste. For the desert I shared the butterscotch pot de creme, which was hein, OK.Overall, my experience at this restaurant was just OK, I was expecting certainly more., Took my mom, Grandmom, and girlfriend here for dinner the Friday before Easter. I had read and heard great things, and was really looking forward to a great piece of fish. I wasn disappointed. I knew it was a fish market, but didn realize that what the entire front area was. Made our way to the back and were sat at a nice corner booth with a round table. We started with a bowl of mussels Addie style (garlic, tomatoes, shallots I believe in a broth). Man, these were the best mussels Ie had, and I hate writing that because the ghost of Granville Moore may read Yelp and not let me in anymore. But they were meaty and delicious and the broth was great for the bread.I tried my Mom arugula salad with dried cranberries, feta, and pecans, but I not a huge fan of arugula, so it was just meh to me. t worth noting 2 things about the menu: 1) You can double any appetizer and make it an entree, which dramatically expands your options, and 2) you can choose any fresh catch from the market and the chef will prepare it for you. My grandmother is a picky eater from small-town NJ, so all the newfangled fishes on the menu didn really appeal to her. She was very pleased with the grilled shrimp with roasted potatoes and broccoli.For entrees, I had the bigeye tuna, Mom had the Halibut, girlfriend had the crab cakes, and my grandmother had grilled shrimp. I. My tuna was fantastic. It was perfectly rare, but seared on the outside over the wood grill so it captured those flavors. My mom halibut came with a mussels escabeche and was delectable. The crab cakes were the best Ie had--definitely not skimpy on the meat and had peppers in the filler for a nice jolt to the tastebuds.We indulged in dessert, but we could have gotten away with a smaller bill if we had shared 2 instead of each getting our own. We had the Butterscotch Pot de Creme, creme brulee with raspberry coulis, apple cheesecake, and chocolate peanut butter crunch cake with candied bananas (that one was mine--I a glutton). The best were the choco/PB cake and the Pot de Creme, though the latter had scotched milkshake, and the liquor got to be a bit much by the end.Overall, wonderful meal. Only marks against are the poor salad selection and expensive desserts ($11 each). With only one glass of wine (total, not each), 3 apps, 4 entrees, and 4 desserts, total bill was almost $300., good food, limited wine list. The service is not always very amicable especially at the bar but i like this restaurant for a casual night out., Best seafood in DC, in my opinion. Everything we ordered was delicious: fresh and flavorful. The service was great. My favorite was a buttery, glazed fish (cod, I believe) appetizer. We were there months ago and I cant wait to go back!, Busy busy Friday night and we get there early before 6.... Perfect dinner!!!!!! Started with the arugula salad.....my date had the ceviche......Ordered the yummy Alaskan halibut and date got the whole seabass.....which guy from kitchen came over and de-boned for her.....very classy.Finished with tiramisu for her and I......I had the trio of creme brulee....delectable scotch, vanila and choco mousse.......too much :) .....even though we were stated non-regulars here we were treated like KING and QUEEN which was very much appreciated since my date was celebrating her PhD completion., Very good, Im quite pleased.Service: Overall pretty good, our table took a little while to get ready, and our entrees took a little longer to come out than the kitchen anticipated, but they made up for it by offering a free dessert. Waiter was reasonably attentive and nice, but didnt hover.Ambiance: Very nice, the middle room there was crowded, but wasnt exceptionally loud and I could talk to my girlfriend without having to yell.Food: The most important part! Food was very good! I had the mahi mahi ceviche which was excellent, perfectly seasoned, fresh, etc. Also had the scallop with morels, brown butter, and capers which was melt-in-our-mouth fantastic. Girlfriend had oysters and the Addies mussles, both of which she enjoyed. For dessert we had the peanut butter chocolate crunch cake, which was quite good and not super-dense like other chocolate desserts tend to be.Overall a very pleasant experience. The pricepoint is high enough that Im not going to come here often, but everything was very good and I would certainly put this on the list of places to go for a nice night out., I got happy on Wednesday at BlackSalt Happy Hour. It a fish market, so expect it to smell a little fishy at the bar, but youl hardly notice after two Kir Royales at $5 each (normally $10), or in Fenny L. case, 3 bellinis ;) You have to request the happy hour menu, or at least I did. It almost as if the barkeep didn want to give up this Secret holy grail for frugal grazers. I didn order food, but their mussels for $8 were tempting. I didn think $1.25/per oyster was a great deal. Aren they regularly $1.50? Maybe because the two they offered were either fancy-shmancy Maine natives or lived among the wild ponies on Chincoteague Island is why they were more??I liked that at 4:50pm there was plenty of street parking. I even nabbed a spot right out front (and I didn have to embarrass myself with my terrible parallel parking skills). Il be back alright, and I may just have to stop in for brunch. Chocolate stuffed French toast? Oh yes!, Have you ever tried saying no to Kevin L? It impossible, right? I can totally see why he the CM for DC, because he can make anyone do anything. He just says things in such a way, that you can say no without feeling like the world biggest heel...so you end up saying yes. Although I was slated to leave for Florida to visit my in-laws at their new retirement community early the next morning and I had errands to run, when Kevin L said Happy Hour at BlackSalt? I didn even bother to try to say no. Why feel like a heel when I *know* I going to say yes eventually anyway? Cut out the guilt-filled middleman and just say yes.BlackSalt is located on a quaint little strip on MacArthur Blvd, where the rich people live. I can ever live here, because I not smart enough to pull together a Ponzi scheme, so I try not to drive through neighborhoods that makes me gnash my teeth in envy. At the entrance there is a large fish counter, a la fish market, which threw me off at first - did I walk through the right door? But then I spy the radiant glow that is Kevin L at the bar towards the back, and I knew I was at the right place.With him, was the wonderful Libby F who must have thought that I was some sort of insane asylum escapee (I tend to give that first impression), due to the way I was staring so lustfully at her Kir Royale. $5 happy hour champaign cocktails? Where has this place been hiding all my life? I start off with a mimosa, as that is usually my litmus test for champaign cocktails. The perfect balance of orange juice and champaign; walking the line so that the mimosa doesn taste like a fizzy orange juice, nor a citrusy champaign seems easy on the surface, but is too often screwed up. While this wasn perfect it came darned near! I move on past the plebeian mimosa into the bellini, which was delightfully tasty!I have only two small issues with BlackSalt, none of which will prevent me from coming back. The first is that there is a very strong fishy smell when you first come in. Yes, I know, it the fish, but I was also raised to believe that fish should never smell. My uncle sushi joint never smelled like fish, even though he would butcher whole fish at the counter. Secondly, I know that the wait-staff was preparing for the dinner crowd, but considering how non-busy it was, I felt like we should have had more attention paid to us. I noticed at least two servers chatting it up in the back kitchen, and there were two or three bartender/servers in and out of the bar area, so it wasn like there was a serious shortage of staff.However, like I said, these two issues are minor, and I will definitely be back! The menu looked interesting, and I loved the space, which was clean and chic without looking trendy or dated. Love it! Definitely looking forward to planning a birthday dinner for a friend or two here!, In a single word - WOW! This is really an great place to go for seafood. The dishes are delicious, the wine is fantastic and the service is superior. Went there for a dinner and we had the chefs section. We have 4 fantastic dishes. We had two different kinds of wine (Savignon Blanc and a Pinot Noir). The wines were fantastic. This is by far the best fish restaurant I have been to in DC. I am going back., I really wanted to like BlackSalt more than I did. I reeeaaally wanted to be in love with it. I think I might have been, too, had we arrived just half an hour or more later. Still, its an all-around solid happy hour, and I cant walk away being less than pleased.Heres my sole point of contention: it should not require upwards of fifteen to twenty minutes to shuck half a dozen oysters. Particularly when there are only half a dozen customers in the restaurant. My suspicion? That they were doing some pre-dinner training, which someone drew all of the staff away from what they would otherwise be doing: taking care of customers.As I understand it, the oysters here used to be less expensive. During happy hour, the pricing the day I went was $1.25 each, which isnt shabby in my book. I had an option of two types of oysters, so I split them half and half. I think Ive mentioned this elsewhere, but eating oysters to me is an academic experience. I dont -luuuurve- them. I dont think theyre gross (anymore). But I find that consuming them is more an act of culinary analysis than visceral enjoyment. Still, I can appreciate how large and fresh-tasting the ones I consumed here were.What won back big points for me was the generosity of the wine pours. Although happy hour glasses of house wine run $6 here (nominally more expensive than some other joints in the area), its definitely a hefty glass that is well worth the marginally higher cost. One of those babies and I was feeling pretty good - Im pretty sure two would have meant that I finished off more than half a bottle. With my yellow person tolerance, a single glass was enough to get me back to happy.Although the bartenders tended to be randomly absent, when they -were- behind the bar, it wasnt a burden calling one over to help us with a refill, or to put in an order. Were not talking as friendly or as attentive as Urbana, but it was satisfactory.When feeling the need for some oysters, I think Id more likely be found at Sea Catch, but BlackSalt is fine enough of a destination to meet up with friends - at their suggestion., Best steak Ive ever had. Is that weird?Yes, I know its primarily a seafood restaurant, but I couldnt help but order the Filet.What I dont like? a) I cant remember the name of what I ordered b) I went to their website to look it up and in order to see their menu, I have to download a plug-in # FAIL no thanks.Anyway... it was awesome. Served with some barley something that was awesome. In a brown sauce that was awesome. Boyfriend got the seafood stew (not sure if they still have it, we havent been for a while) and it was also awesome.Service was pretty great (I wouldnt expect anything short of stellar when Im paying $200 for dinner), and we even got to dine a couple tables away from Rosario Dawson.The restaurant itself is pretty cool - open kitchen, which is nice because you can see everything that goes on. The problem was that we sat RIGHT by the kitchen, so everything came past our table, and the space is so small that we almost had to suck-it-in every time someone wanted to walk by. We ordered ice cream for dessert - over priced but delicious.I gave it 3 stars because the space is a bit cramped, and while the food is stellar, it is just a bit overpriced.Overall, Id go back if I was rolling in money - but for the price, Id rather go to 2941., I had the opportunity to visit this quaint little restaurant tucked away in the Palisades for dinner with friends on Sunday and was pleasantly surprised. First and foremost, right upon walking in, BlackSalt is a fish market. Fresh seafood is proudly displayed on top of pounds of pristine shaved ice. Its presentation was pretty impressive. The fish market was remarkably clean and contemporary and the seafood looked and smelled fresh... more of an ocean type smell than a fish smell if that even means anything. Now I rarely ever brave enough to cook seafood at home but if I did, I would love to say that I buy my seafood fresh from BlackSalt.Just beyond the fish market is where the bar & dining area is. You would think that, visually, a transition from a fish market to a cloth napkin bar & dining area would be a bit too drastic but in this case; they somehow managed to make it work. It was all very quaint. The raw bar was decorated with the same contemporary stainless steel chairs and fixtures like that of the fish market. Unshucked oysters were displayed on top of shaved ice built in to the middle section of the bar and there was still ample room for your place mat, wine glass entr39e and side plate.I was with a party of 6 and we actually opted to sit at the bar for drinks and food and take advantage of the happy hour specials (daily from 5-7pm). The drink menu listed a Pimm Cup (Pimm, Ginger Ale and shaved ice) that one of my friends suggested I try. I glad that I did. It was as refreshing as a summer breeze. I immediately ordered another from Jenny, our friendly (and adorable) bartender.Our group ordered from the happy hour menu a number of small plates to sample from. The fried Calamari, fried Ipswich clams and fried Salmon Cakes were among them and they were very good but also typical. The Oysters Rockefeller, Oysters on the Half Shell and the PEI Mussels were my favorites among the small plates. I not, by any means, an oyster connoisseur but the oysters on the half-shell were appetizing, smelled like the ocean and tasted really fresh. The mussels were also outstanding, served in an herbed-broth with a hint of curry.For my entr39e I had the Seafood Stew, which was absolutely amazing. The shrimp, mussels, fish, and calamari were served in a light broth. However, what I remember most was the perfect combination of baby spinach and garlic that seemed to bring together the entire dish... very light and flavorful.For dessert, you definitely do not want to forgo the Peanut Butter Crunch Cake with Bananas. Another perfect combination. Need I say more?I already looking for a reason to go back!, Ate there based on Yelp, was not disappointed. Sat at the bar and had a Classic (champagne, bitters, lemon), sauteed baby octopi, and fried Ipswich clams. The clams were the best fried clams Ie had, not overpowered by grease and carbs but still oily/crunchy and fresh-tasting. Octopi likewise tasted fresh and were well-prepped. The cocktail wasn so exciting, so next time Il try kir (champagne and chambord) or Pimm. It was bustling on a Friday night, mostly 30-60yr olds in casual but classy attire. Neat ambiance, seemed very modern and upscale, and the staff seemed to know the menu and ingredients inside and out, and was able to recommend complementing drinks, etc.I will agree with another reviewer though: the dipping sauce for the Ipswich clams wasn so hot. The Madras aioli was too much like your bland Anglo curries, so I prefer something a little fruitier/spicier (something like cocktail sauce but classier) and/or something creamy but herbal/bitter. Having a little dish of each would be outstanding, I actually almost asked the waitress for a different dipping sauce, shoulde done so.But aside from that one sauce (which Il email the restaurant about and suggest considering a new option), I was quite pleased. It busy on a weekend evening, so not a place for an intimate first date, but great food and upscale crowd., This place is deserving of all the praise it gets. Ive had brunch here a few times and snacks/dinner in the evening a few times, and the food is really just flawless; creative, fresh with an eye to local producers, and beautifully presented. The first time we had brunch here I was ecstatic, seriously, its so good. They give you such a delightful little fruit salad with slivers of basil, and if you order the muffins or scones, you may be ruined for life as no other baked goods will quite live up to the treats youll recieve. Their egg dishes are amazing too, and the price of brunch is completely reasonable. I cant give it five stars because it is SO expensive for dinner! I dont think its a particularly FUN happy hour spot, but I assume everyone goes here for happy hour because otherwise, its difficult to justify spending that kind of cash on a weeknight. I dont like it for happy hour. Its still pretty expensive and frankly, the bartenders are snotty. They do make great drinks though, which almost excuses their snottiness. The times we have been and gotten appetizers their dinner fare has been just as impressive as their brunch fare; and I guess they can charge what they like because, well, their foods that good. Its a beautiful, special-occasion restaurant...which is why I love going for BRUNCH because its affordable. Despite the fact that I live nearby...Im not rich. But Im sure a lot of people in this neighborhood are...The fish market is a great place to go too- the guys are super friendly and helpful- they seem to like selling you their excellent fish and will tell you how to prepare it if you have questions. This is a really special place. Well done, Blacks!, 3.5 stars.I had very high hopes for this place, and whil it certainly wasnt bad, it wasnt great. We did the tasting menu, which was basically just a sampler of stuff from their regular menu. I like to think of a tasting menu as a chance for a chef to get a little creative, not just give you smaller versions of the stuff they always have. Also, two of the courses were basically the same, both flaky white fishes pan-seared and served one right after the other. However, everything was very good, which is why I would consider going back but not ordering the tasting menu., We love Black Salt. Very fresh seafood, prepared creatively, in a lively atmosphere. It can be hard to get reservations, and it does fill up., Very fresh seafood. The fish market leads you straight to the dining room where more excitement awaits. Its touched with a faint smell of seafood but its not bad. Surely a place like this is lively and loud., *This review is for the Fish Market only*Stopped by Saturday to pick up any sashimi-grade fish available, and I hit jackpot! They had 5 sashimi-grade available, and I opted for rockfish, red snapper, and salmon.It was super fresh, melt-in-your mouth goodness. I brought home the fish, along with some squid, mussels, and clams for pasta dish later, and sliced the fish (rather poorly, might I add) and enjoyed it with some fresh wasabi and soy sauce. What a delight! And after handling the fish, you can barely smell the fish on my hands - another indicator of the quality of the fish.I love this place!, My husband and I had dinner at BlackSalt last night. After the Georgetown Safeway closed, we had to drive to the Palisades to the new Safeway, and kept seeing BlackSalt. We were able to get opentable reservations within hours of dinner.We arrived a couple minutes early. Unlike other reviewers, the fish smell didnt bother us that much, it was actually cool to see the market and all the fresh fish.We were seated right away, but then had to wait... wait... wait... for our waiter to come over. We joked that he def. just got dumped or something was up. When he finally showed, we ordered 2 signature drinks and the heirloom tomato salad with fresh ricotta. The drinks were amazing, strong and delicious. The tomato salad was ok, not the best ever.For dinner I had the mussels, which I highly recommend, very delicious. My husband had the grouper, it was a flash fried and served whole with potatoes and green beans. We kept ordering drinks and were happy when our total was around $110. Sort of pricey for a Wednesday, but at least we can cross it off our list. Id go back again, just for the mussels and drinks.Enjoy!, This is a really excellent place and the food is very very good. Seafood is the freshest in town I think and prepared beautifully. I had a branzino which was in a stew and was plate licking good and very fresh. They made a perfect manhattan. It was booked on Open Table but not as crowded as we expected. The market looked very nice, it was a lively neighborhood kind of place., Wanted to avoid the wait and crowd on a Friday, so we had lunch. Yum Yum. The calamari w/chipotle remoulade had me wanting more. But we had to save room for the crab cake and provencal seafood stew. The crab cake had a wonderful smokey flavor and my hubby wanted more bread to soak up the broth from the stew. The key lime pie was okay, but overall a nice lunch for my 10th anniversary., This is best fresh seafood counter in Washington, D.C., noteworthy for the wide variety of fish and shellfish. Its so much more interesting a selection than is offered at Whole Foods. Expect to pay $17-$24 a pound for most items, but the flavors are extraordinary.  Metered coin parking in front of the entrance is in 5-minute increments. The storefront is on the North side of MacArthur Boulevard. Pick up a restaurant menu by the register, and make sure your fish includes a bag of crushed ice., Black Salt is, without a doubt, the freshest seafood in the District. The space itself is gorgeous with the fish market up front, with a granite and stainless steel bar behind that (my favorite place to dine) and the dining room in the rear. The wall of the bar area is decorated with a fresco of sea creatures that appear to be from a Roman villa, perhaps in Pompei.On my last visit a half dozen oysters split evenly between Hama Hama and Malpeques were impeccable; no need for the mignonette that accompanied them. That was followed by the Provencal seafood stew filled with plump mussels and gulf shrimp, a match for any bouillabaisse. The summer salad was replete with beans and beats. Accompanied by a glass of Longboard Vineyards Sauvignon Blanc, and life is good!
6|blt-steak-washington-washington|I wont lie. When I ate here, I was all psyched to try a steak with bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich or entree. No dice.I came to find out that BLT does not stand for the food item, but for Bistro Laurent Tourondel (Tourondel is the chef). This place is kind of a French bistro done American steakhouse style.The decor is sleek- dark furniture and suede fabric. As I hoped, the steak was very, very good here but the sides were even better. Creamed spinach? Amazing. Dont expect to see the typical bread basket or pre-cut French loaf here. And that is not a bad thing. Instead you get fluffy, hot pop overs served with a dollop of butter and salt on the side.The good news is they give you the recipe, so you can try and make them at home. Now..where is the creamed spinach recipe?, Open for just 6 weeks, this may still be the honeymoon but I have seen many new restaurants that have not executed nearly as well as this one. The service was great, the menu is simple but well prepared, and the deserts are excellent. I did not look at the wine list very closely, so I can not comment other then the Pinot by the glass seemed reasonable.The first thing that you will notice when you walk in is the extensive raw bar which includes a number of delicious varieties of oysters and clams.. but this is not McCormick & Schmicks.. service is snappy and steak is the headliner here. (warning: a friend of mine had lunch here and told me that the service was sketchy).Beef includes Wagyu quality as well as Kobe (the Kobe was an astounding $26/ounce).We had the 12 oz filet and split it between 2 people with a side of the most delicious beluga mushrooms.. with a salad each it was plenty of food.The cheese selection was quite good. I may go back for just some cheese and wine. The desert (a carrot cake with ginger ice cream was amazing).The bill was about $75 (for 2 salads, 1 entre, and 1 side veggie) but then we added another $75 in liquor and wine. I think that it was worth it, and I walked out with a big grin on my face., Palm Steak Meets Hip and Cool. I liked the atmosphere, the people there were nice and efficient. Noticed too many men in suits on the floor working, maybe because it just opened. They brought out 2 dishes as complementary prior to our meal, and they were delicious. Although I got full by the time I had my steak, it was Very generous. I had a NY strip, which was alright. I should have tried the Kobe, which seem to be their speciality. My boyfriend had a Lobster, and that was one of the best Lobster dish wed had around this area. HUGE 3 pounder split in half came in a heavy iron skilet, with tail-side simply grilled, and the head portion grilled with bread crumbs. Very good. Price overall was a bit pricey, but its the atmosphere that made it seem ok with that price tag. Disappointed with the raw bar though., Very DC.... Kobe beef almost seems like a deal given that everything else is so much higher than you are used to paying. Atmosphere and service is pretty impersonal -- the steak is very good, but honestly I like Rays the Steaks a lot more -- seem to get more char from hotter flames.....10 oz filet is $42 (and no, that is not the Kobe filet) -- add a salad ($12) -- a side (another $12) -- and a couple of glasses of wine ($26) -- and you are out about $120 without dessert -- at Rays you are out about $45-50.I would probably opt for other steak house options at lower prices -- though I did like the idea of blue cheese tater tots (better than the actual execution).......the pop overs were very good -- and I liked the mini iceberg salad with blue cheese and bacon.I have heard some very bad things about service -- my experience was ok -- nothing special, but nothing to complain about....., A modern restaurant with a bit of flair.I ate here three times so I am pretty familiar with the menu and have tried a few different dishes. First off, the house specialty bread is excellent but it is only served if you order a steak dish. If you are interested in their Kobe beef dish please remember there is a minimum 5 oz limitation. Each ounce of the specialty beef is about $25 so that comes out to about $125 piece of a steak. Personally Id go with Braised Ribs instead of steaks since they tend to char their steaks a bit - Not my cup of tea but you may like it.For appetizers I highly recommend the oysters as well as cheese platters. The wine selection is very good and extensive and the staffs are fairly knowledgeable about them as well, so dont be afraid to ask for recommendation.For side dishes I like their mushrooms but I think the selections maybe seasonal. I also like their Parmesan gnocchi as well. I do not have much of a sweet tooth but their crepe souffle with passion fruit sauce is warm and smooth between cheeks., Arrogance is an art form at this pompous downtown steakhouse. With prices to match the attitude, the food is very good and very forgettable. Note that entrees are just that , and portions are unusually small, so youll need to order a few sides (sides are small too). One can certainly do a lot worse in our city, but for the money you can also do a lot better., Great chic NY-style eatery, including upscale NY prices. I paid $4 for an iced tea, which is problematic. Most of the the food I had was divine. The cheesy warm popover/bread was honestly the highlight. The veggie panzanella was decent. The cod was perfectly seasoned and an incredible cut. The passionfruit creme brulee was a little taste of magic. Recommended if money is no object. Cool wine list too!, This place is a dimly-lit cafeteria, with very rushed service. The servers huddle in a corner, pouncing on empty-ish plates they can wrest away from you and ignoring you otherwise. That said, this is definitely the best place in DC for a great steak without a lot of pretense; good if you don mind paying $80 for a dinner without feeling like it a special occasion.The salamander broiler really chars the steaks, and they are very good about cooking them to order, so you can get a very nice texture gradient from raw middle to crispy exterior if you like. I order the $41 12-oz. filet rare; it pretty expensive, but at least the delicious cheese popovers and chicken liver pate eliminate the need to have an appetizer. As to the complaints about small portion size, just pretend youe on an austere pound of meat for dinner diet.Oh, and I see lots of kids here. Also Justice Scalia., the horror of the service!A party of 6 of us arrived last night around 10:15 looking very sharp. After drinks at the Park on 14th, we wanted something to eat. No we were not wasted, otherwise the McDonalds on 13th would have sufficed. Anyway, we just wanted something a little more than an appetizer per person. The princessy waiter was pissed that we didnt want entrees and was openly rude and unhelpful. He was actually combative. We ended up getting the huge seafood platter and got a double sirloin sliced up 6 ways with a number of sides. I didnt pay, but Im guessing with a couple rounds of top shelf, the food, and after dinner coffee drinks we were hittin around $400. At this point it was only 11:30 and they were rushing us out the door. INEXCUSABLE behavior. They even took away unfinished drinks. We were bumrushed by so many bussers that we didnt know what hit us. The manager was busy somewhere towards the back not paying attention although we were in plain view.I understand that we were the last table there, but as a server I have waited patiently on a $25 check later than we were there. I will never go back here. The food was actually pretty good, but the menu overall seemed overpriced and with service like that, there is no way in hell I will return.We really wanted a nice time. They did their best to ruin it. Failed. But definitely lost future business., This is one of those places you take someone when you want to impress them with your many benjamins. Or you could just light a wad of money on fire in front of them, whatev.But seriously, this place is pretty good but it is so freakinexpensive. Seriously, more expensive than normal expensive restaurants. The lobster costs $75. I got a piece of cod the size of an iphone for $40 and it didn even have any sides. At least I didn order the $10 onion ring (that right, 1 onion ring) like the big group of shmucky lawyers next to us.It is also SUPER noisy - I didn actually talk to the people sitting across the table from me-style noisy.I do have to say that the dessert was so incredibly good - it was a big peanut butter mousse covered with chocolate and banana ice cream. I would go back just for that - like eat somewhere else and only order that., NY hot-shot chef Laurent Tourondel spin on all things beefy gets high praise from many of my friends, but not from me. Overpriced and overrated is my take. Still, I know some that swear this is their favorite and I have to admit, the fresh-from-the-oven popovers delivered immediately to your table could warrant a visit all by themselves.hardypartyreview.blogspo206, For the price of this place you would think you would get better...well...everything. My friend and I got a table in the middle of what felt like a very cold room (when we should have told them we prefer something a little more cozy) Nonetheless, we started with ordering a bottle of wine which was presented to us and then taken away from the table and tasted by sommelier (where we could see him--because we were right there in the middle of the room where he was tasting it)...after his personal taste he brought it back to the table and let us taste it. It was a good wine, over priced, but good.We proceeded to order, after a very long wait, and our starters came out, and they were wonderful! then the entree, which left us wondering wanting something more, not necessarily portion, but flavor...a fish and beef dish (beef dish being extrememly large and lacking anything else to it)...luckily, the dessert made up for what the entree took away.All in all, great place for a little appetizer dish, or dessert...otherwise, why go out of your way?, Popovers are great, ambiance is a nice change for the K Street snore-idor, but the burgers are way too salty., This is another one of my favorite restaurants in DC and Ie been back here numerous times. The overall decor and ambiance is very chic, but still has a warm flavor to it. This is a great place to meet up with a couple of friends, have drinks, eat, and go out afterwards (all the typical k st places are a couple blocks up). As with most of these Bistro places, youe going to encounter some pretty traditional stuff (steaks, burgers, fish, etc...), but the food has a bit of a lighter updated feel to it. Every time Ie been there Ie always ordered the tuna tartare (great combination of avocado, tuna, soy sauce, ginger, etc...) as an appetizer. The bacon isn bad either as an appetizer. If youe feeling really ambitious you can try their seafood platter, which is a combination of stone crab claws, muscles, oysters (fresh from the oyster bar), and other random fresh seafood. This is one of the only places in DC that I know of that serves Kobe beef. If you haven had kobe beef before it great to try here, but for the price its one of those special occasion types of dishes. For all the meat lovers, there is a pretty good selection of other cuts and those change daily (as well as the seafood bar). One particular area for improvement (and a reason why its only getting 3 stars... as one of my favorites) has to deal with the service. On the different occasions Ie been there, the wait staff has appeared aloof, slow, and has even screwed up orders on a couple of occasions. I can deal with crappy service at a restaurant like this and it appears like it is the norm here. So all in all, great food, selection, and overall ambiance... but service sucks., I know there are plenty of steak places in town - including Rays - but I have to say BLT is my absolute favorite. The sizzling ribeye - medium rare, please - that comes out on the iron skillet, along with a whole head of roasted garlic, is just heavenly. The meat is always perfectly seasoned and cooked to what I order, and even though all of their sauces are delicious, I dont usually need them as the steak itself is so flavorful. At about $40 for the steak, I think its a great deal. As for the side dishes, which you order for the table to share, I love any of the mushroom selections - hen of the woods being my favorite. I have so little self control, and every time I go back I tell myself not to gorge on a) the petit four that comes out with pate and b) the gynormous popover hot out of the oven, which comes with room temperature, spreadable butter (one of my biggest pet peeves is getting hard rock, cold butter - wtf?). By the time I get to the steak itself I am sometimes halfway full and steak is never as good on the second day as leftover, so I just end up stuffing myself silly. I like the low key atmosphere too., I thought this place was okay. Definitely not somewhere I would plan on going back, but I wouldnt mind if I ended up there for another company lunch. The music was kind of loud to compete with the din of the K street lunch crowd. I thought the food I had was good, and you pick your meat by looking at a map of a cow (which was educational!). But my meat was the only thing that got served individually, all the sides and appetizers were family style, which isn always great when youe with coworkers.I wouldn complain about the price of this place, except that I had a moment of panic where I though my company wasn paying for the meal, and therefore I would have had to split the meal with three corporate lawyers. As a non-corporate lawyer, this place seems super overpriced.I wasn going to, Been here a couple times for lunch for a work thing. The popovers are delicious, and worth going to BLT just for them. I ordered food off of the lunch menu - tomato and onion steak, and then salade nicoise. Both very good. Cant say anything about the steak because Ive never tried it. One bad thing is the service though - they were very slow. When one of my coworkers went to complain the manager threw the waitress under the bus - even though it didnt appear to be her fault., ive eaten here several times and will continue to because its fun. however, the food (including the steak) is about a 7..other than the free pop-overs which are amazing. the service is a 3- maybe a 4., This is a nice see-n-be-seen restaurant and the food is pretty good. They keep things simple and do them well but nothing really blows you away. The steaks and sides are very good but again, nothing special that couldnt be found somewhere else. The sides are just average and served family style. As someone else mentioned the popovers are incredible and they provide the recipe tied to the handle of the dish. Service was ok but our waiter kept disappearing...overall, nice people and nice food., I almost did not dine at BLT Steak based on the reviews on Yelp. But I decided to give it a chance anyway, and Im really glad I did. BLT Steak is loud. Theres no question about that. If you want a place for a quiet dinner, go somewhere else. If you want amazing food, go to BLT Steak. The service was outstanding and most of the food was simply incredible. The popovers they give you are great, the shrimp cocktail was some of the best I have ever had, my steak was excellent, and the peanut butter chocolate mousse for dessert was to die for. The salad was not great and overpriced and my baked potato was subpar, but overall the food is amazing and its a great dining experience. Ill definitely be back., Definitely an expense account type of place. The steak is pretty damn good, and the variety of sauces can please all palates. That being said, Im a little person with a small stomach. If i go for dinner, the petite filet disappears off the menu and Im stuck with no option but the mondo 12oz filet. That leaves leftovers, and everybody knows leftover steak is never as good as it was when it was served piping hot.Expense account type of place = probably too overpriced for their own good.However, the popovers keep me coming back. If only I could get those suckers to go...., I have eaten now at both the New York (57th St.) and DC locations, and I enjoyed this one the most. Part of that is its a more spacious dining room with a bigger and swankier bar. I also think the wine list is a little more robust here but dont quote me on that, I drank a lot of it both times.Wow is the food good, pretty much no matter what you order. For example we dined on a veal chop and a tuna steak and both were cooked to perfection and delicious. I also like the way you can order a couple of sides to go along and they are just the right size for sharing.The service was impeccable and one of the highlights that left a good impression was a free tasting of a dessert special even after we had decided not to order (too full!). Nice touch and it basically gave us a dessert, just in one small bite.BLT Steak is a great steak-house experience and worth the price. I wish I could afford to dine there on the regular., 5 STARS Probably the BEST dinner Ive ever had ! Seafood and steak lovers - this is the place to appreciate you food ! FOOD -5 STARSWINE LIST - 5 STARSHOSPITALITY - 5 STARS, I went here for a happy hour. I heard great reviews about the food but I was disappointed. The food wasnt that great and to get to the roof was a nightmare since there was only one elevator that we were allowed to use., 3.5 stars.The decor was contemporary and unlike the typical stuffy white table cloth steak houses. I like the semi casual atmosphere at BLT. It was certain an expensive restaurants where you can find plenty of people in suits, but if you show up in khakis, you also wouldnt feel out of place. I also saw two tables with children (although well behaved). This is not a place to go to for a quiet romantic dinner since the dinning room was very loud and almost every table was filled even on a Tuesday night.The service was also more casual than you would have expected for an expensive restaurant like this. Our waiter was also a bit goofy. I actually prefer this kind of service than something more on the formal side. The drinks were expensive. Allagash white on tap was $7 and cocktails were $14 (so weak, I can barely tell that it was a cocktail and not just some fruit juice with ice). The giant popovers were delicious with its layer of baked gruyere on top, although I think the giant salt shaker was unnecessary since the popovers were already lightly salted. I had a tiny nibble of the complementary chicken pate, and couldnt handle the gaminess. I am not saying it wasnt a good pate, I am just not a fan of organ meat regardless of preparation. Raw bar was so so. The mignonette was way too vinegary and over powering and the oysters were too mild for my taste. The scallop was naturally sweet, but the citrus sauce for the scallop had too much sugar.The shrimp and crab claws were both fresh and very good. Tuna tartar was perhaps my favorite dish of the night. All the components of the dish were layered and shaped into a cube. The impeccably fresh tuna was coarsely chopped and topped with tiny bits of fried shallots. Dont you hate it when sushi restaurants mash up their tuna to mask the fact that its a low quality tuna? The thin layer of avacado on the bottom was perfectly ripe. The ginger lime dressing pooled around the avacado wasnt too salty and complemented the fish nicely. It was also modestly priced at $16, almost a bargain if you compare it to sushi. We ordered the baby potato salad on the specials menu. It was rather disappointing. The menu description stated baby potato salad with chorizo, wax beans, and cilantro. I only saw potato and wax beans. It was also salty and had too much mayo. I dont recommend this at all. We ordered a medium rare filet. It was charred on the outside and topped with a pad of melting herb butter. When you cut into the filet, it revealed the succulent tender red flesh. As far as expensive filet goes, I think BLT was average. The inside was tender and beefy, but the charred outer layer was very dry and flavorless. My take on this is that the char method is more suited for a fattier cut such as rib eye than a filet. We didnt have room for desserts, but they did give us two complementary chocolate medallion shaped sweets. They tasted like very fudgy caramel flavored brownie. It was a very nice finish to a meal. Sure, the tab was almost $200, but its not everyday that my MIL comes to town and babysits destructo mode baby while husband and I can have a night out. It was worth the splurge., By far the best steak I have ever had! My mouth starts to water just thinking about the juicy filet mignon, perfect french fries, and savory mushrooms that are my must at BLT. The popovers are delicious too! They also have wonderful bar snacks: the olives they serve here are some of the best I have had! Cant wait to go back!!!!, good veg selections!for those vegetarians throwing the meat eaters a bone this place has an excellent chopped vegetable salad thats easily an entree. Id suggest one popover...not two with the salad.service is excellent. down side is...mixed drinks can be a little weak., Decor and service are spot on, but even on a weekday night in August, it was still pretty loud. Our meal started with the pate (gamey, delicious, smooth) and popovers (the size of my head, no joke). As a nice touch, they included the popover recipe (which is my popover recipe x2 in volume, in the same size pan, explains the size). Five stars. I had the chopped salad (which came with lettuce, unfortunately) and filet (which looked like a little volcano of beef) medium rare. The filet was more cooked on one side than the other, which was unfortunate. I thought it was ok, but Ive had better for 1/2 the price. Two stars. Overall: 3.5 stars (might try another location first)., Washington DC boasts many steakhouses, and tonight I got to try my husband favorite. As has already been stated, BLT has a more modern style than most DC steakhouses, with lacquered tables and velvet chairs instead of paneled walls and dark booths. One decorating misstep in my opinion is the huge and hideous floral arrangement in the middle of the room - better to replace it with a modern arrangement or a wine bar. I did enjoy the suede pillows on the banquette seating.BLT offers some nice gratis touches from the chicken pate (very soft, spreadable and flavorful), to the hot and crispy popovers (definitely eat while still hot), to the dessert bite at the end (more later).For dinner, we each had a glass of red (very pricey) and the lobster cocktail which was one pound of a two pound lobster. The presentation was lovely - one half of the body and tail, and one large claw with briny chilled meat. The briniest Ie ever tasted - a real treat. We continued with our entrees of Chili-rubbed Wagyu Flank Steak and New York strip cooked a perfect medium-rare with peppercorn sauce. We added sides of brussel sprouts (a little sweet but delicious chunks of mortadela) and earthy hen-of-the-wood mushrooms. Our steaks were very flavorful but I must say they weren melt-in-your-mouth soft. We skipped dessert but were given the most lovely little treats - chocolate espresso petit fours I believe they were called and OMG - a bite of warm chocolate heaven to say the least!! BLT steak is very expensive. I would eat here again, but visit many other places first. I was not disappointed in anything - as a matter of fact the service, food, atmosphere were all pleasing - but it lacked that je ne sais quoi that keeps you coming back over and over again to your favorite spot., I choose to come here often for business lunches during the week. Personally I am in love with the bread. They give you these warm & delicious personal popovers that are filled with air inside and crunchy on the outside. It is funny but I work mainly with men and for some reason I am usually the only one to eat the bread... not sure if they are trying to tell me something but it is still very tasty and I recommend trying them out! Service is always perfect and management is friendly as well. We held a small client even in one of their back rooms about two years ago. The clients that were there still talk about how great the food was. Personally I love the tuna entree and the raw bar. The salad with lobster is great as well. I would not recommend coming here on a date night or with friends on a night out but for business events it is perfect., Enjoyed my first time here!Great way to spend a night with friends!Met with family and friends and truly enjoyed the fact that they did not close the kitchen... we stayed late, and they kept going. What a great place and what more can you ask for.Popovers - the only way to go!I will go back again!, the see-and-be-seen location for a good business lunch.Fair Warning: ive never been to BLT during a dinner shift, and ive never had a steak here (altho ive watched people eat them, who seem very satisfied). for the standard business lunch, tho, with folks you want to show a nice time before they, say, testify on your behalf in congress, its a fab option in a convenient (for me) location. for lunch: the servers are attentive and can get you in and out inside of whatever timeline you give them (in reason). the popovers are bananas - so lite and buttery and perfect. i struggle not to fill up. entree-wise, i enjoy the veggie salad w/ grilled shrimp (you can get it meat-free or w/ other, more carnivorous options as well), the lobster cobb, and the delightful selection of fresh oysters. theres about 5 other things id get on the menu, easy, but i never manage to make it past the shellfish options...every person ive brought there on business, tho, has spent the rest of the afternoon gushing about some or other part of their lunch, so i feel its got good options no matter your menu preferences. atmosphere-wise - very pleasant, light and airy (for a steakhouse), and theyll check your coat. which i like. theres tables, booths n a bar to sit at, all of which are pleasant options and you get a good view of the room from wherever you end up (for prime peoplewatching). it gets a good bustle up in the lunch hour but ive always been able to call 10 mins ahead and get a table (even for a party of 6...every time...). there is also the private room option if youve got a meeting or you need more space. ive never indulged but their wine list looks great, if pricey. and damn, i wish i could manage to pack in dessert without needing an afternoon siesta - some of their sweet stuff (ie: crepe souffle w/ passionfruit sauce, blueberry lemon meringue pie w/ lemon sorbet....) looks dreamy. all in all, i like BLT. i think its a win - in atmosphere, accessibility, food and service. and ive never even tried the steak., I have been wanting to try BLT for some time now. The restaurant is wonderfully decorated - providing a relaxing and comfortable environment - just as any good steak house should. Although I felt a bit overwhelmed at first with the number of wait staff servicing our table - they were never pushy or trying to rush us through our meal - pivotal for me as I am one of the slowest eaters I know. The wine list can be overwhelming, so I would recommend reviewing it online before you visit the restaurant - but they do have a nice 2005 Petite Sirah on the list from Lodi, CA for a very reasonable price. It was a nice compliment to the filet. I ordered my steak rare - and although I would have preferred it a bit more bloody, it was still very flavorful and tender. In addition to a good meal, the kitchen also offers complimentary small bites for appetizers and dessert - which is a nice touch from the chef., We had an executive meeting in town this past week and on Tuesday night I went with three co-workers to dinner at BLT Steak. They wanted something upscale. The food was outstanding. The portions were a bit large for some of the meals, but that is just the way of the American restaurant.Two of us had the Prixe Fixe Menu and though it was pricey at $60 per plate, it was a better deal that a la carte. The service was decent, though not quite as attentive as I would expect at an upscale restaurant.The food was superb. I enjoyed scallops, a light salad, brussel sprouts and a banana bread pudding that was out of this world (tasted a bit like bananas foster).If you aren looking to shell out $75 a person (including a glass of wine) then stay away, otherwise, worth at least one visit., Not bad...at all. Service was great and food was good (thou one of the waiter annoyed crap out of all of us). Presentation is really awesome, you can probably bring a date or two to impress, but hey, it worked with our clients (all dudes). Our clients first saw my invitation e-mail with BLT and they were hesitant, but then they were happy to see it steak place, not a sandwitch joint. Sometimes important things are lost in translation...like the rest of DC biz. Highly recommended., I am not going to write a long review here but I would like people to know a little about my experience with this place last weekend. My fiance and I went there for my birthday. I am a steak lover and regularly go to The Prime Rib whenever I am craving a nice piece of red meat. We decided to go to BLT instead since it was supposedly very nice and figured it might be a nice change from our usual spot. The service was HORRIBLE, I have never seen anything like it in my life. The thought of going back there and dropping $350 for dinner with service like that is insanity. We had a long talk with one of their managers after dinner which resulted in her offering to have us back in on them but at that point, the damage was done and my fiance refuses to go back. The food was good (not great) and I certainly feel that there are better alternatives in the area. I guess some others on here have had better experiences but we were appauled at the quality of their wait staff for such an expensive restaurant., Had a couple of work meetings in Washington, DC late last week and decided that we would head here for Thursday night. We had three in our party and were promptly seated at a table. I wish I could break down my rating on service for this meal because it would have been a two at best...the meal started off well and I thought wow our waitress really is laid back, shes not going to rush us through this meal...cuz thats what she said. Then after she ignored us for 20 minutes (literally), she rushed us through our order. I just thought that sort of behavior in an establishment such as BLT Steak is unaccetable. So my four stars is simply based on the food, the drinks, and the food, and the drinks...STARTERS:* Chicken Liver Spread -- Im not a fan of chicken liver. Period. BUT -- this was actually quite good. Not overpowering, but a slight metallic taste...it really was nice.* Cheese Popovers -- holy grail of bread. Spread the slightest amount of butter on the inside, sprinkle with a bit of course salt that is provided. Youre in heaven.Note: Both of the above appetizers are free...sort of like the Cheddar Bay Biscuits at Red Lobster, but not really like that at all.The appetizer I paid for was the Tuna Tartare...simple. Clean. Delicious.MAIN:22-oz Ribeye ($45) -- Well-prepared beef could bring a tear to my eye and this was as close to perfection as I think you can get. The bone was left in the ribeye, so you just get this amazing flavor throughout a great piece of meat. Side note: I ate the whole thing by myself. Im not proud of this.SIDE:French Fries -- they were screaming at me. Hate me. No desserts, but I made up for that by drinking two of their cocktails called Smashing Pumpkin. Pumpkin puree, vanilla vodka, cream, and cinnamon. Awesome. Like pumpkin pie in a martini...I think the other two in my party were not AS impressed by BLT Steak as I was -- the partner in my firm I was with had to send his steak back because it was underdone. Party foul...he seemed to enjoy it when it came back. If youre looking for a great meal and someone else is buying -- go to BLT Steak!, Popovers as big as a babys head. Thats what youre greeted with upon being seated at BLT. Served on a wood chopping board and accompanied by creamy butter and a larger than life shaker of sea salt, they signify the start of a fantastic meal. If your first serving of yeasty goodness isnt enough to satisfy your carb intake, fear not! Next arrives a pot of chicken liver pate with French bread. Full yet? Wait, theres still the appetizers, steaks, sides, desserts... a dizzying amount of food. The tuna tartar resembles a piece of art. It could be housed in a square plexiglass box and tucked away somewhere within the Hirshorn, its that pretty. A square mound of diced tuna is sandwiched between layers of ripe avocado and a crispy layer of unidentifiable goodness. Softly shaved ice rests beneath the plate, keeping the tatare perfectly chilled and the pool of soy lime dressing cold. I wondered, bite after bite, could I finish it? Would I still have room for my 22 ounce ribeye? Oh wait, two more appetizers to sample! My dining companions chose the crabcake and the roasted beet salad. The crabcake is easily the best Ive had in the city. Hardly a bit of filler, just pure sweet crabmeat resting on creamy remoulade sauce. I could have eaten two of those for dinner and called it a night. The beet salad reminded me of the countless other versions that have been popping up throughout DC. Id pass next time in favor of one of BLTs raw bar selections or the crabcake. The steaks come out next, I can hear them sizzling as they come out of the kitchen, One ribeye, two new York strips, and one filet with sides of red wine and peppercorn sauce. The disks of herb butter that melt across the steaks are wonderful, even better than the sauces. Our table faced a problem with the steak knives we were given. Hardly sharp enough to cut through a piece of bread, led us to saw through our meat. Maybe next time Ill bring my own cutlery. Our selection of sides included: creamed spinach (Charlie Palmers is my preference), grilled asparagus (I still like my own the most), fries (hardly warm when they came out), and potato gratin (the favorite of the table). I think dessert deserves its own paragraph. I always, always order dessert, its a travesty not to, but rarely am I satisfied with the choices and ultimately my selection, but BLT is different. On a previous visit I had had the peanut butter chocolate mouse with banana ice cream. One word : yum. This time around I ordered it again, still delicious. Other selections at the table: apple tart (I dont even want to know how much butter went into that tart crust, flaky, flaky, flaky), chestnut sunday (I have never in my life seen a sunday this big, homemade icecream, chocolate sauce and chestnuts = perfection), and doughnuts (not as crispy as I would like but my mom happily munched away).The service at BLT is fantastic, if a bit impersonal. With the extensive support staff the time actually spent with your server is limited. Theres a separate person for everything here, making the entire experience flawless. This was my third visit to BLT, Ive also dined during lunch and been a guest at a Christmas party hosted in the private back room. Whether youre spending $19 bucks on lunch, dropping $500 for dinner, or stuffing your mouth with free food at a Christmas party, BLT has you covered., My favorite steakhouse in all of DC.Nice, attentive waitstaff, always accommodating., Came in again, on a busy Saturday night and ordered the same thing. I was NOT disappointed in any way. Service: Still awesomeFood: Still fantastic!Prices: Still a bit high but considering all the extras you get, like complimentary bar munchies (olive medley, smokehouse almonds, gourmet seasoned popcorn), warm chicken liver pate on toast points, and the petit fours for desert, It turned out to be a fair price. (~$120, included three glasses of wine, appetizer, steak and veg.)Not an everyday dinner place, but once or twice a night won hurt..., Il sum it up with this: for the price point, not the most amazing steak Ie ever had. However, the meal was delicious and if youe not concerned about cost , it probably worth checking out for a special occasion. My date and I had the tuna tartare to start. Based on the website, I thought there would be a few smaller sushi rolls on a plate, but it actually one massive portion of tuna, wasabi, and crunch. It was pretty good. For our meal, we ordered the filet with creamed mushrooms, French fries, and green beans. It was good, nothing remarkable, though. The best part of the meal, and why Il be back to BLT, was the dessert. We ordered two because we couldn decide, and then were offered a complimentary dessert. On top of all that, each patron is given a small chocolate after the meal. We had the crepe br3bl39e, which my boyfriend described as God pancake and the peanut butter mousse - also awe-inspiring. The free one was a vanilla bean custard that was light in consistency, but rich in flavor. Overall, everything from the service to decor to the food was merely average - good, but not great - until the dessert., The food is extremely gourmet. I had the rosemary chicken which was great. The service was great--everyone always just pitches in to help each other. LOVE that about this place. I love the chocolate dessert with the crunchy bottom. Nice casual atmosphere., Sixth or seventh time here, this time for lunch. Guess that tells you something--it doesn suck! Ambience still a little noisy but not too bothersome. Service continues to be hit or miss. This time a fat ball over the plate and big miss. Rude and inattentive waiter, out of the bottle of wine we ordered (but took 15 minutes to learn that), no sommelier on staff, steak sandwich with fontina extremely average.For the good, even great...a bean soup that was savory and a tremendous start to lunch and a Kobe beef burger with bacon that was outrageously good, and I not traditionally a wagyu fan.And the fries...oh, the fries. Stunningly crunchy, well presented, perfectly salted...hell the fries are worth a star by themselves!Pricey, but not out of line with other top steakhouses. Bottom line: this used to be my go to restaurant when coming in to the city and wanting a flawless meal. No more. A nice place that can have flashes of brilliance but has a roughness to it that is simply unacceptable for a place of its stature., Ate here on Valentines Day and had great service. We got the 22 oz ribeye and the 14 oz veal chop (both around $45, so I cant comment on the $90 kobe steaks). Everything was excellent. My only complaint could be the sauces accompanying the steaks were a little overpowering for the meat which is excellent all on its own. Thankfully, they come on the side. Save room for dessert -- all were good, especially carrot cake with boozy caramel and ginger ice cream!, If youe on a budget go some place else. I split a ribeye with my dining mate, ordered a bunch of appetizers and sides, had a glass of wine and the bill was almost $200 including tip and tax. Am I complaining? No. I got the disposable cash...but if you don then don come here. Also if you can control yourself from eating free bread before the meal then go some place else. The popovers are really tasty and addictive. I sure theye spoiled many meals for diners who don have the Jedi mind powers to resist hot, fresh, cheesy bread. The decor of the place is a bit more modern/updated than the regular steakhouse, not old school like Morton. If Morton needed a Gordon Ramsey makeover BLT Steak would be the end result. More younger looking place, cool vibe, slightly more inventive dishes, and friendly/attentive service. Wish I could say more but it looks like a lot of Yelpers have already weighed in on what foods to order. My only advice...skip the lobster (cobb) salad. 3 chunks of lobster and a HUGE bowl of greens don equal $20 in my opinion. Also the gnocchi side was a little too gummy IMO and lacked flavor., Went here on a Tuesday night around 8.45pm after finding out Ribeye required a jacket (even at the bar -- I have a jacket, but WTF on the stuffyness factor) and was initially quite surprised on how sparse the seating was in the restaurant compared to other BLTs I had been to (then again, space is probably cheaper than in NYC). This is by no means a bad thing, its just a bit surprising since its a fairly large place. All that being said, who cares anyway, since I ate at the bar. So their wine list is pretty extensive and they do have a number of reasonably priced wines, one of which I ordered for 80$ which was very good. They went to the trouble of pouring it into a decanter even though I was by myself which may be of interest to those of you who arent planning on finishing it. For dinner I ordered a caesar salad and the flagship steak (the bone in sirloin) + potatoes au gratin as a side. I immediately realized I had made a mistake in ordering the caesar when they brought out the famous bread popovers + a chicken liver pate. I didnt try the popovers this time around (ive had them at other BLTs and they are awesome) but the pate was quite good, though they could have brought out more bread with that plate. So then I moved onto my salad which was enormous -- I think i mentioned already that I had made a mistake in ordering it. However, the dressing and flavour was quite good, and the crutons actually had a bit of spice to them, which actually went great with the dressing. Not soon after I finished that the main event came, and I was not disappointed in the slightest. It came perfectly cooked, and had very little fat on any of it with a circle of butter on the side in a black broiling pan. I also ordered the peppercorn sauce which went quite well with the buttered steak, though if your a traditionalist, the steak itself is awesome on its own also. The potatoes au gratin were pretty good, though I would have to say they are a little better at Capital Grille. I didnt try desert, but had a glass of port, and speaking of, their selection of port is kind of lacking -- especially given their excellent wine selection. They only had 4 ports?At the end of the night my meal came to a little over 200$. All said and done, I think BLT Steak is very good, and would give it a solid 4.4 stars. Next time I come to DC i would certainly be up for coming back., I went to BLT for the restaurants Birthday Bash, which meant (1) I got an amazing deal and tried a LOT of yummy food; (2) the service was inattentive and slow; (3) some of our food came out objectively cold; (4) the place was hopping - and SUPER loud. Overall, I had a great meal at BLT. I am still stuffed and its been 12 hours since I finished eating. I am empathetic with BLTs slow service (it was really busy) and the cold food (it was really busy), BUT the noise was unbearable. We were seated right next to the bar (a kind of crappy place for a table) and I had to strain my voice and scream across the table. Grr. Ok, onto the food: Chicken liver: not a fan of it in general, but my bf liked it and the bread was really good (and its freeeee) Popovers: Um, YUM. Doughy and melt-in-your-mouth and HUGE. Im very glad I have the recipe. Now all I need is a popover pan. (Caution: We ordered a LOT of sides since they were only $3) Blue cheese tator tots: Came out cold, unimpressive. The potato flavor was kind of foul. Onion rings: DELICIOUS. Puffy and salty sweet. Come in tower form. Potatoes gratin: Not like the thin layers of potatoes, but like little chunky round morsels covered in melted (a little burnt, but in a good way) cheese. YUMMY. Jalapeno mashed potatoes: The flavor was good, but Im sorry...this looked like baby food. Braised carrots: I loved these. The texture was really nice to have next to the mashed potatoes and creamy spinach. Sweet! Creamy spinach: Yummy. Standard. (PS. next to the jalapeno mashed potatoes and carrots, it looked like an entire baby food feast) Also, I promise we had leftovers of nearly all these sides. I admit to polishing off the carrots. Filet: DELICIOUS. Super expensive for the meat if you were paying full price, but I was beyond satisfied at paying $33 for it. The horseradish sauce added a nice kick too. I got mine Med Well and I liked how the outside was charred and crispy a little bit, without compromising the insides medium wellness. Rib-eye: The bf ate almost all of it except the fat around the edges and the bone with marrow (which went to the dog). This either means that hes a ravenous carnivore (true) or it was really good (likely also true)., My experience was almost exactly the same as Rebecca Cs. I too was there for their Birthday special and with the rare, low prices, we just about ordered one of every side. While the service was nothing to get excited about (actually, it left a lot to be desired), the food certainly was! The fillet, butternut squash, potato skins, carrots, and trumpet mushrooms were all to die-for. The brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes and tater tots we probably could have done with out. Im sad we didnt save enough room for dessert, we were just too stuffed. All in all, great food, average service, decent atmosphere - glad i went on a discounted night otherwise, it could get very pricey. Ill go back again on a special occasion and hopefully the service will be up to the standards expected when fine dining, I recently had the good fortune of visiting the BLT on its 6th anniversary. What a steakhouse! It was a beautiful, contemporary steakhouse tucked right off of Farragut Square. It did not share the stuffiness of most traditional steakhouses. Thank goodness! Most of the main entrees were $33.03 and sides, drinks, and desserts were $3.03. Im a value foodie, so I was absolutely ecstatic about the pricing. For a chain, it has earned my respect. Normally, I would prefer independent restaurants, but the quality of the food and service has certainly captured my love to become my favorite restaurant in DC.I dined with a few fellow DC transplants, we were ordering food as if it were our last meal. We mostly avoided the appetizers, went straight for the kill. We were slightly detracted by the little treats offered by the server, I experienced my first popover. It came out so hot and fresh, I almost burned my fingers popping it! Nothing like a bit of danger with my food. We also received a little pot of liver pate which tasted so exquisite and refined I almost didnt think I was in a steakhouse! Ordered 22oz. bone in rib eye, medium rare. It came out on hot sizzling plates, which I obsess over at steakhouses. The rib eyes came with an extra cut of bone and marrow, another rich side to compliment the chewy meat. The meat tasted well aged and flavorful without the meat getting lost in the fat.To supplement the steaks, we ordered creamed spinach, asparagus, potato skins, jalapeno mashed potatoes, and stuffed mushroom caps. We were going to order the onion rings, but it looked a little the onions were battered too much. All the sides tasted very good. The potato skins were topped off by some cheese and smoky thick cut bacon bits which tasted very comforting another annoying cold DC evening. The jalapeno mashed potatoes were flavorful but didnt set off any fire alarms in my head. And my favorite side was the creamed spinach, it came out looking pretty green and not too creamy and it was gone before the rest of the sides were halfway done.Usually after such a heavy meal, I would avoid dessert, but it was a special occasion! We ordered the peanut butter and chocolate mousse with banana ice cream, which was very good to my surprise. The server raved about the carrot cake topped with ginger ice cream, and it lived up to the hype. We ravaged the dessert even after a heavy steak meal. The apple crumb was lacking in pop compared to the 2, but the vanilla ice cream tasted great.Excellent service and ambiance even on a busy evening. So props to the kitchen and servers being able to deal with the DC crowd.If I had to associate one word for the dinner, it would be: foodgasm!, I went here a few months ago and never got around to writing about it. In the meantime, the meal I had here has been looming in the back of my mind on a daily basis. The filet mignon was served with a large slab of herb butter on top- giving it a really distinct flavor. The filet was tender and cooked to perfection. To accompany the steak, we ordered Roquefort cheese sauce and a red wine sauce for dipping. They were both delicious. The side dishes were also fantastic. We ordered fries, onion rings, potato gratin and creamy spinach. My only regret is that we didnt order more fries because they just go so well with this kind of fare. For dessert, I had the peanut butter chocolate mousse. I really enjoyed the mousse but It came with banana ice cream which I didnt really understand, I felt as though vanilla would have been better. Overall, it was a really pleasant dining experience. I will gladly return., Alright I get it it, its BISTRO Laurent Tourondel, and therefore one should expect a bistro style experience, and thats all well and good, but it should be all or nothing. A restaurant cant call itself a bistro when its self serving, and then position itself as a top flight steakhouse at other times (notably the pricing) Bottom line, is if you go in here expecting Capital Grille, youll probably be disappointed. Attributes are pretty good food, nice furnishings, and did I say pretty good food? Detractors would be intimate dining (with your neighbors), a kind of questionable crowd (hooded sweatshirts are not appropriate dinner attire nor is an Ed Hardy t-shirt with a sport coat while eating dinner with your cumare), and really ostentatious prices (think 5x pricing on the winelist) that scream nouveau riche and are reinforced by the crowd.Maybe Im a snob, maybe Im getting old - but Id rather overpay at place a little more deserving., Ie been lagging getting this review out, so I forget which night we went - I thinking it was a Saturday around 6, in Dec 09. We got a sofa corner table with pillows, and it wasn very full. The service was extremely attentive, each course and treat came out at the right timing. Husband had the bone-in ribeye, on a sizzling iron plate with a marrow bone. His rating on that steak is hovering around a 9. He also ordered the potato skins and tomatoes for sides. The skins were a little too dry/browned but with ample toppings - they were actually better the next day once all the grease soaked in :D. He loved the tomatoes, I thought they were bland - just a tomato with the top cut off, stem not fully removed, topped with 4c italian breadcrumbs. I had one of the specials - angel hair with caviar and quail egg that had a delicious little toast on the side, bouillabaisse - not a traditional fish stew as I was expecting, but a pile of perfectly cooked fish/shrimp/scallop etc with a sauce I can even describe, mushrooms topped with cheese and quail egg - OMG I would come back and just eat that - and a creme fraiche/I forget custard thing with cranberry compote, which was light and creamy, but I couldn finish because I was so stuffed! The popovers, pate and espresso-brownie bites almost did me in on their own, and all gratis!With a few beers and a carrot cake with ginger ice cream (awesome), the bill was over $200, I would love to go again but it will be awhile., You had me at popovers, BLT Steak.I could stop right there. . .but Ill go on. After my first visit I was so enamored of the meal I convinced two friends to return for another dinner here less than a week later. Two meals down, heres what Ive learned about BLT Steak:- Skip the pricey meat, get the hanger steak and share it with at least one other person. No one needs their own steak! Who are you trying to impress by ingesting ten ounces of beef?- The tuna tartar is massive and magnificent, and you should order it even though this is a steakhouse.- The Caesar salad is notable. I do love a good Caesar salad!- I didnt care for the jalapeno mash but the potato gratin is really lovely. Ditto for the creamed spinach. Doesnt everybody come to steakhouses for the sides? Or is that just me?In sum, the portions of just about everything are huge, so dont be tempted into over ordering and definitely visit with people who like to share food! Going this route takes BLT Steak down a notch from pretty pricey to moderately priced and youll definitely leave well satiated. Also, its not an overly stuffy spot - you can definitely go in wearing jeans (but make sure theyre not too tight, youll need room to expand after those popovers!), Ie been here twice for lunch in the past three weeks, so I feel like I have a good handle on this place - and as previous reviewers have mentioned, I pay good money to just eat the popovers. I also a fan of anything free, or built into the cost of everything on the menu, but the popovers really were awesome.Ie had both the kobe strip steak sandwich (with foie gras and bacon, as if one form of decadence was not enough), and the burger. Both times, there were things that just made the experience not great. No matter what part of kobe I having, I do expect it to be smooth. With the kobe, there was no way to really bite it cleanly, and I ended up having to go at it with a knife and at times, really pulling the meat away. The burger, for being a $16 burger, was just ehhh. Being close to Ray Hellburger has really spoiled me - but I happy I live close to one of the best burgers around (Ray, not BLT).Don get me wrong, the food was decent - but the prices are pretty high. I say it more of a seen and be seen, Washington DC style, for a power lunch., It was a lovely tuesday afternoon to go up into DC and meet a colleague for lunch. He asked me where and I said BLT Steak. He said done! So we met there, he got us table outside.BLT is Bistro Laurent Tourondol, a great chef with other BLT Steaks in NYC, Hawaii and California. It was one of those places that I wanted to try especially for their famed cheese popovers. So, as we sat down, my colleague decanted a 2006 Matriarch from Bond Estates, my first time have wine with lunch (yeah I know) it was splendid! I was excited to look through the menu and see salads, sandwiches, lamb, steak and veggies. The decision to pick one was difficult, luckily the staff at BLT were awesome! Their General Manager Adam was courteous and made great recommendations. Marcel our waiter, uh! what can I say, he was exceptional. And their sommelier Nicole, knows her wines and knows them well.We started our lunch with my favorite appetizer, bacon! Grilled to bring out the smoky-ness it was a perfect start to a great lunch. The cheese popovers were soft and fluffy. And go well with the bacon!So it was time to pick out my entree and I had no clue, Adam recommended the Ribeye, it looked good so I went with it and I ordered it with the Bearnaise sauce. My colleague went with their lamb and the mustard sauce. We ordered the grilled asparagus which were grilled well with a bit of bite to them but the main show, the meat we ate! My ribeye was ordered medium and that it was, it was juicy, well seasoned and yummy! And the bearnaise just only enhanced the flavor of the ribeye.The lamb, when it was brought out I had to sneak a taste of it. I did! The lamb was at the right temperature, not gamey, soooo good! So good that I brought both lunches home! Couldnt help myself, cant let ultra good food to waste.And what is lunch without dessert? Marcel was great in this department as well, since I was indecisive, he brought me two! Loved it! Their crepe souffle with passionfruit sauce was creamy and delicious. But their peanut butter and chocolate mousse with banana ice cream was the hit. The banana ice cream was divine! Oh and the passionfruit sauce, I could eat just that!All in all, BLT was fantastic! The staff was awesome, the food is excellent and the whole experience just superb. I would love to come here for dinner. Go to BLT Steak and you will not be disappointed., CliffsNotes: A great and reliable restaurant for any occasion. The prices are fairly steep but you get some additional perks (cost already built into the prices) like chicken liver moose, pop-overs, and miniature chocolate cake bites at the conclusion of the meal. Dont worry, because BLT doesnt have to cost you an arm and a leg. Portion sizes are often enough for two so sharing is perfectly fine (This suggestion does not apply if youre entertaining clients and have access to a corporate expense account). I recommend limiting your table to one appetizer for every two people because youre already getting an assortment of other aperitifs. Unless you absolutely crave raw seafood, I recommend skipping the seafood platter ($65 for two) because there are better raw seafood platters elsewhere at cheaper prices. Besides, arent you here for the steak? BLT is the type of restaurant where I trust actually serves Kobe beef (hint: $26/ounce). As Mariam W. mentioned, is there really a need for one person to eat more than 10 ounces of protein? Share an entree and order a side dish instead. Lastly, unless your dining companion absolutely craves dessert, skip dessert because BLT provides you with something for your sweet tooth at the end of the meal. Bottom line: Yeah, BLT is a chain but youll still enjoy it. Last Visit: April 2010, Great service, great food. Highly recommended as a lunch place., I recently went to BLT Steak and it was my first experience. Its been a few months now that Ive been working just a few blocks away from the restaurant, and after hearing all the oohs and aahs from co-workers, I finally got my chance with a client lunch.When I first walked in, I immediately noticed the design of the restaurant and how open everything is. We were seated indoors (on a gorgeous DC day), however, by the section where the doors open to the patio and sidewalk and we had the fresh breeze that felt like we were outdoors. The decor was contemporary casual. Tabletops were marble with no tablecloths. The back wall had the menu posted in large font and could be read from my table halfway across the room. The waitstaff was professional yet approachable. First came the popovers. This was my first popover experience and they were brought to us with the popover recipe nestled in the basket. SO GOOD that CHEESY BREADY GOODNESS! I had to restrain myself to only eat one otherwise I wouldve inhaled the basket and had half of my lunch. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with sherry vinegar fries. My serving of fries couldve easily fed 4, but I ate them all anyway. My coworker had the spiced swordfish club with serrano ham, avocado, and garlic fries as well. Her fries couldve easily fed 4 as well, and easily ate half of hers plus one of her sections of her sandwich, which was light and tasty. The third at our table ordered the black angus burger and it was huge. Looked delicious. Looking back, I shouldve also ordered the burger. It looked so juicy and plumpy.We had a great meal with excellent service. It was very pricey (though not over priced), and its a great spot for a client lunch or a special occasion. Unfortunately I couldnt fit in desert (after all those fries), but I will be back for dinner and you can be sure Ill order desert then., Had the tuna tartare, it was good, but not better than any other tuna tartare Ive had, there was way to much soy sauce to drown out the flavor. Had the salad nicoise and that was unimpressive. The yolks werent fully done in the eggs, the bowl was too small and deep to navigate gracefully and the chunk of tuna was less tasty than a can of chunk light Bumble Bee. And the service was not good - when we sat down no one came to offer water or a drink, then our server arrived and asked if we were ready to order. I ordered...water, and iced tea first. Wont be back., I went here with some friends for our regular steak-fest in town. We started in the bar with a round of cocktails before we got sat for a table-for-four in the dining room. After a few recommendations from the server and a study of the menu (including a fixed-price menu and the chalkboard menu located on the back wall), we each decideed to order something different so that we could sample the different cuts of meats.We ordered the porterhouse (shared by two), the ribeye, and the hanger steak with a few side dishes for the table. We forewent the appetizer and enjoyed the complimentary toast and liver-pate and the huge pop-overs that were individually served and came with a little recipe card. These items along with another round of cocktails were enough to wet our appetite. Our steaks were served in their own cast-iron skillets and they were excellently grilled to perfection with a simple seasoning of salt and pepper and a smothering of butter served with a choice of sauce (we got four different ones). The side-dishes were small and not as spectacular. We ended our meal with dessert and coffee which were tasty.Overall, we had a great, albeit pricey, meal with excellent service. The waitstaff were professional and complemented the quality food. I would definitely recommend BLT if you want a good steak and nice night on the town.
7|blue-duck-tavern-washington|I guess the Tavern in the name refers to the food being served in casserole dishes. Or maybe the apple pies on the counter. No matter, because I really didn find much tavern about this place. Huge windows? Well, the place does have the tavern-ish dark tables.After noticing the open kitchen, we sit down. Looking at the menu, I discover some of the meat and produce used here is brought in from Pennsylvania of all places. And other items are from local farms, and still others are from farms across the nation. From the descriptions of the offerings, we learn that the chefs are big on using fire in their cooking---all dishes seem to be either wood roasted, braised or cooked slowly over flame.With apologies to Donald, I had the soft-shell crab. It seemed inappropriate not to have at a place with duck in its name. But I went against the grain. It was deliciously crispy. We followed up dinner with dessert of ice cream made in house and bourbon flambeed chocolate cake. Go here just for the strawberry ice cream -- I implore you, If you think this restaurant serving an Asian dishes, you are making a wrong interpretation dear..Blue Duck Tavern is a classy and elegant American restaurant while the menu is taken from the traditional American farmers around the country.Toni Chi the designer of the Blue Duck Tavern that have been successfully creates a modern and edgy look with a touch of a classic Asian decor.I have a swonderful experience dining here.The food is exquisite and the service is the first class experience!Love the fact of the servers wearing a sophisticated suit is definitely distinguish from some other restaurants, completes with their impressive excellent manner that makes this gourmet restaurants absolutely outstanding!Accompanied by the jazzy voice of Diana Krall that smoothly sang my favorite songs.. s wonderful! s marvelous!You should care for me!s awful nice! s paradise!s what i love to see!Youve made my life so glamorousYou cant blame me for feeling amorousOh! s wonderful! s marvelous!That you should care for me!, An interesting experience but nothing spectacular. Ultra modern setting fused with traditional tavern food. Pretty good food, respectable wine list, nice atmosphere although slightly loud, average service., The only restaurant in DC I give a 5-star. I had a fantastic time at this restaurant. The decor is simple, sleek and sophisticated. Its not like a typical DC restaurant with dark wood paneling and dare I say it, it reminds me of LA and Manhattan restaurants.I went with a party of 4 and we all had something different: my short-ribs were tender and flavorful; the scallops melted in my mouth; the duck was rich in flavor; and the flounder light. I highly recommend the goat-cheese grits if for no other reason than the fact it is surprisingly delicious.Excellent service as well., I loved this restaurant. The interior is beautiful- it reminds me a little bit of Zaytinya. The tables were well-spaced, so it didnt feel cramped. There were lots of people having celebrations this week (graduations, etc.) and it was definitely a great place for that. It would definitely be good place to take parents except that it is noisy. The service was impeccable. We loved the bread that they served. There was only 1 vegetarian choice in each course, but honestly, the sides looked good enough that, for once, I wouldnt have minded ordering them as a meal. But who needs lots of choices when what they have is amazing! I ordered the butter lettuce with shallot dressing, which sounds really boring but was amazing. So flavorful and fresh. For my main I ordered gnocchi with asparagus, morel mushrooms, and fava beans. It was wonderful. We also 2 sides- the pickled beats and the seasonal vegetable of the day which was sun chokes. Loved them both. My boyfriend ordered the ribs which he loved and the smoked trout which disappeared in an instance.The only problem came with dessert, but the restaurant dealt with it very well. I ordered the lemon marscapone custard with fruit. It was delicious. I reminded me of the marsala custard at 2 amys. My boyfriend ordered the fruit plate after asking what fruit was on it. The server said blueberries and strawberries. He got a bowl full of cherries which he doesnt like. So he asked for something else and they brought him a traditional fruit plate. Some of the fruit was great- some of it was not very ripe. Overall, it was just a little let down from an otherwise spectacular meal., I had the most wonderful dinner here with my girlfriend Beth F. (see her own review below for the vegetarian perspective) after an afternoon NSO concert at the Kennedy Center (a little far of a walk, but a quick $6 cab ride). While it located in the Hyatt, it has its own entrance so you never have to enter through the hotel. The place is elegant without feeling too stuffy or formal; a great place for a special date or to celebrate something. The service was outstanding and everything you expect from a high quality restaurant -- attentive, helpful, friendly. our wine was great (she got a rose wine, I got a pinor noir), and the food excellent -- my braised short ribs with steak sauce looked like something fred flintstone would be eating because of the massive bone, but the meat was really tender and juicy and falling off the bone. wow, it was delicious! Carnivores will be very happy here-- and I can wait to return to try the lamb shank, roasted duck, or crabcakes.then came dessert... they say that life is like a bowl of cherries, and unfortunately for me, that all I got for dessert. yuck. it like it came out of can. i don like fresh cherries in any case, and I felt a bit tricked because the server told me the fresh fruit for the evening was strawberries and blueberries. I sent it back, something I never do, but our server happily replaced it with a normal fruit plate with grapefruit, grapes, strawberries-- what I had wanted in the first place! anyway, this was the only minor problem with our meal, but it did not change my overall impression that this is one of the best new restaurants in the city. For American fare, it tremendous and gets my highest recommendation., I had lunch at Blue Duck Tavern today and was very impressed. Ambiance and decor get five stars. The interior was designed in what one of my lunch companions called mid-century meets Zen - lots of wood, simple lines and big windows with lots of light. What I liked best about the ambiance was that for a fancy schmancy restaurant it was surprisingly unpretentious. The wait staff was very friendly, though a bit slow.The food was also good, though it didn knock me over as much as the ambiance/decor did. I got a spring pea soup with morel mushrooms that was a shocking shade of green and tasted very fresh. It was almost too simple, like fresh pureed peas with almost no flavor added, but I enjoyed it. For my entree, I got the tuna tartare with field greens. The tuna tartare was also good but like the soup, the flavor was a bit too mild for me. It was interestingly topped with a raw quail egg.One of my friends got the scallops, which came in a metal dish with huge pieces of scallops on it - I tried one and thought it was very tasty. We also got baby carrots and the goat cheese grits for the table. The carrots weren that exciting, but the grits were awesome. Fluffy and cheesy.Warning: The bill was astronomical. We paid over $200 for four people for lunch!, Food -- One of their claims to fame is that they buy a lot of local produce. You can really taste the difference in freshness and the simple preparation. -app-local asparagus with house cured bacon vinaigrette-very delicate and tasty with a soft boiled egg on top.-diver scallops---amazing---just braised with a bit of lemon and thyme-dinner-hanger steak--perfectly cooked with great simple seasoning, atlantic flounder--a bit lackluster---needed ooomphsalmon-had a lovely crust of crispy cheesedessert-carrot cheesecake---lots of body--not great tastecoconut sorbet---mmmmmmmmm. amazing... very light and tropicalapple pie-they bake this in-house it is delectableDecor-- lots of wood, gorgeous little floral arrangements. Service-- Muted service. Very unobtrusive. Everyone wears a grey suit.Cost--two people, 2 cocktails, 1 bottle wine, apps, entree, 2 sides, dessert= $260 including tipGood place for ....special occasion, out of town guestsBathrooms... very spartan, We have been visiting DC and were looking for a place to eat and hopped onto Yelp to see what was nearby our hotel. I normally hate eating in hotel restaurants, but I really loved this place. As others have noted, theres a separate entrance, so you dont even feel like youre in a hotel. We were able to eat outside, which was great. The garden behind us seemed to be in the process of growing some herbs and tomatoes, perhaps for future use in food. I appreciated that they noted the local origin of each type of food, emphasizing the freshness of the ingredients.Food-wise, this was great. One vegetarian entree, that was delicious, a great butter lettuce salad, and sauteed leeks and cheesebread as sides. One person had pea soup, which was a little salty, but reportedly the crab cakes and scallops were fantastic.Bathrooms were clean, restaurant had a nice ambiance, but the service was somewhat slow. I dont mind having a leisurely meal, but I felt that it could have been more attentive.Good drink list and a decent variety of alcohol.I did bring my kids (aged 9 and 7), but they are veteran diners, so I dont know how it would be for other kids. In general, Id say its a much more adult place.All in all, quite recommendable., I went here with a group - there were 6 of us together. We loved it. Everyones food was delicious, the staff was attentive and polite and helpful, and they had a minimal corking fee and had no problem with the bottles we brought in.I had the soft-shell crab appetizer and tried the pea soup that my boyfriend got. Both were delicious. We ordered a number of different items. I had the braised short-ribs, which were fantastic. Tender and flavorful. I tried a number of the other dishes and nothing was bad. I also recommend going with a group so you can order all the sides. They were delicious. I dont remember a single bad side. Overall a very satisfying experience. Highly recommended. P.S. If the weather is nice make sure to grab a patio seat - its beautiful out there!, Christmas brunch in 2006 was my first trip to the Blue Duck and it wont be my last. I was particularly intriqued by the bratwurst and sauerkraut on the menu. Being from Wisconsin, its rare to see a good old brat on the east coast. But being from Wisconsin, I also know its hard for an east coaster to beat a Wisconsin brat. The Blue Duck did it. This was by far the most incredible brat I have tasted. Tender, succulent, perfectly seasoned. It melts in your mouth. Sigggh. Ive had brats all over Wisconsin, in Germany, in Denmark. Ive brated around. Blue Duck. You beat them all. Im, as soon as I finish typing, off to make my Restaurant Week reservation for the Blue Duck Tavern. Gotta have another brat.On another note, I booked this reservation through Open Table and had no idea that the offering for Christmas was an $80 buffet brunch (oysters, shrimp, etc.). While I love to eat, Ive never been a fan of the buffet. I just cant eat that much. I politely asked the manager if my party could simply order the items offered on their entree menu for the brunch and be charged for these a la carte, and we were courteously accomodated. Im a big fan of fine food, but an even bigger fan of fine service. Ill be back., Fantastic Hanger steak and Scallops. Dont both with the Hanger steak salad, just go straight for the steak itself. Atmosphere is great at lunch, outside patio was lowered and private enough so that you didnt feel like you were eating on a busy street corner. Very good choice., Dined here last night for the first time. Friend is moving to Tanzania of all places with an NGO for a year, so this was her last good meal for a while. The decor is modern with classic lines. Lots of polished beige stone with mahogany colored wood, high ceilings, awesome bar area up front. The furniture is Shaker-style, which is very sparse and spindly looking. I wouldn have guessed it, but it works out pretty well visually. This place is about FOOD. Really substantial, wholesome, straightforward preparations. When you eat meat, they make it very clear that youe eating meat. And same with fish, vegetables, etc. In fact, BDT lists the farm where it sources the primary ingredient for each dish. A little gimmicky, but an appreciated effort. Since this was a last supper of sorts we took the gloves off with the ordering. Appetizers4 each of Cape May Salts, Hog Island, and Rocky Bay Oysters: Fresh oysters, not much more to it. Carpaccio of Young Farm Lamb, Summer Beans, Artichoke, and Olives: The lamb was delicious and cut razor thin, but it was difficult to eat since all the slices stuck together. The summer beans were great, but the artichokes were sized 4-5 times anything else in this dish. Warm Fois Gras, Bourbon Peach Consomme, Gingerbread: Very delicious, perfectly cooked. Oven Roasted Bone Marrow, Roast Garlic Bulb, Grilled Sourdough: Our favorite appetizer. Three hulking bones, split along the bone as opposed to cut across the bone, a huge roasted bulb of garlic, and grilled sourdough. A decadent version of garlic bread - the garlic was so good we ended up popping the remaining cloves on their own. EntreesBraised Barbecue Beef ong Rib Due to the size of beef ribs in general, this entree hit the table and elicited an ooh and an ahh. It so massive you feel as if youe sitting down to eat a mastadon. The meat was braised perfectly - no knife needed here. And the suace wasn a straightforward barbecue sauce - there was a bit more sweetness to it and a little less tang - I wonder if there was some hoisin in it. Wood Fired Whole Sea Bream, Bay Leaf and Thyme: I generally a huge fan of whole fish and my companion didn object to thought of dismantling a fish at the table, so we ordered this and were not disappointed. It was stuffed with bay and time, and just simply roasted with salt and pepper, topped with some lemon. Whole Roasted Maine Lobster, Lobster Drawn Butter: The lobster was just totally unnecessary, but whatever... nothing exceeds like excess. Besides, if you were going to Tanzania for a year, wouldn you want to have this too? There wasn anything particularly spectacular about this - it was excellent in the way all well-prepared lobster is excellent. I did appreciate that it was roasted instead of steamed or boiled - that did add a little more depth to the flavors. SidesClothbound Cheddar Puffs: Light airy pastries with a cheddar note. The cheddar is definitley present, but it as much an olfactory note as it is taste. Meaning, you smelled and tasted the cheddar, but didn catch the sharpness on your tongue. Which for a side, I suppose, is appropriate. Dessert/CheeseSugar Cookies: Got a tin of these to go. Not bad. Selection of Cheeses: Had two cheeses. One was the McCadem Extra Sharp Cheddar, which one the 2007 US Championship Cheese Contest. As expected it was very good. The other cheese was a sheep cheese that bordered on Manchego.Wine:McMurray 2005 Russian River Pinot Gris: 7/10Chehalem 2005 3 Vineyards Pinot Noir: 8/10DP, Simply no.I love Park Hyatts worldwide and was really excited to eat here, but it simply was not good. It a Nouveau American place that I think bills itself as Californian Cuisine, whatever that means, but it was over priced and not that good. I can remember what my girlfriend ordered, but remember she did not like it. I think it was a fish dish.I remember I ordered the apricot pork tenderloin that was way too salty and dry. I want to avoid trichinosis as much as the next guy, but that does not mean I microwave pork till it is dry and rubbery. If it had been less salty, had an ounce of moisture and a little more sweet apricot, it might have been good, but unfortunately was very disappointing.Can remember if we had dessert, but I know we agreed not to return., Gorgeous modern decor, stunningly delicious food, so-so service. The vegetable kebabs with goat cheese grits were amazing ($14, I think). Each vegetable was a perfect package of freshness, flavor, and color. The grits were mild and complex, a lovely foil for the brightness of the vegetables. The fava beans with chantrelle mushrooms were exquisite ($13), and I hate fava beans. My husband fois gras and duck sausage ($ !?!) was delicious, and surprisingly not fatty in texture or gamy.My friend said that her heirloom tomato salad had the best tomatoes she ever tasted. We went for brunch and my other friend said that the eggs Benedict was tasty as well.The cherry blossom ice tea came with simple syrup for sweetening. It was clearly brewed with care and excellent leaves. The coffee ($6!) was very good, but not worth $6. Go to Vidalia if you want a high end cup of joe that worth it.My husband apple pie ($7) was not a slice, but a full dessert plate sized pie, with perfect crust and caramel on top-- delicious. Friend A carrot cheesecake was unbelievable. The crust was a very thin, dense carrot cake that brought out the creaminess of the cake itself ($7). Friend B vanilla and strawberry ice cream ($7) was huge, but they went a little overboard on the home churned angle. The huge chunks of ice felt more freezerburned than rustic. The smooth, rich, dark chocolate sauce ($3) helped matters, but not quite enough.The service was a disaster for this class of restaurant. There were extended periods while we sat with empty drinks and no server in sight. Bread and freezing cold butter arrived about 30 minutes after we placed our orders, and 5 minutes before the food came out. I randomly was given a plate about 20 minutes before anyone else. We didn really mind, because we were having a laid back day, but I would have been an unhappy camper if it wasn brunch. For this reason, I have to remove a star, despite the brilliance of the food.The coup de gras was my dessert--marscapone custard with fresh marinated cherry topping ($7). Inventive, beautifully prepared, this dish was a revelation. A hint of star anise flavored the deep red cherries, emphasized by the light color of the custard. The texture was flawless and the flavor perfectly balanced. Overall: Come here! Come here! Come here, but on a day when you have plenty of leisure time. Don let waiting indefinitely for servers tarnish your enjoyment of the food. This food deserves better., I finally had the chance to have dinner at the Blue Duck Tavern, and I must say overall, it was a very nice experience. The atmostphere and decor of the restaurant is very much my style- posh and modern and in nice juxtaposition to the style of the food- elevated but still traditional. The highlights of the meal were: the wine and the wine list-very extensive with VERY reasonable prices, the squid appetizer- perfectly cooked with a deliciously seasoned sauce, the roasted lobster and the vanilla bean ice cream. The low points were: the bread basket- cold, stale, nothing special for a fine dining establishment, the foie gras appetizer- what did they do to foie gras? I normally love foie gras, but this was whipped into a thinly textured spread that had an unappetizer color and tasted like a strange cheese. The peach, spiced walnut and poppy seed toppings would have been a fabulous pairing with some real foie gras. Also, the braised long rib- while the texture of the meat was divine (tender, literally falling off the bone) the bbq sauce tasted like ketchup...i wouldnt be surprised if thats what they use as the base. So that was kinda disapointing for such a fine place. But overall, the experience was great- good service, attentive but not overbearing and the atmosphere and overall quality of food is wonderful., 4.5 starsI love Blue Duck -- wonderful menu, outstanding service, generous portions.....The food is really wonderful. Pumpkin soup was outstanding. Scallops and rack of pork were delicious and the portions very generous. Mashed potatoes were excellent as well. The food is not overcomplicated -- there is a simplicity and honesty that lets the ingredients and wonderful preparation shine. The wine list is decent -- good variety -- and good selections for various price points. I thought my Conundrum at $10 bucks a glass was a little expensive -- but was then surprised by the generous pour (which was probably at least six ounces).Service was very attentive, though not without lapses -- but felt very well attended to but never intrusive in anyway......very sincere and genuine.Never made it to dessert as the portion sizes didnt leave much room for dessert.I liked the ambience a lot, but am not a huge fan of the tables and chairs -- but overall I would recommend Blue Duck without reservation.Will return., a feast for (eight) KINGS! the occasion: a farewell dinner in honor of a foodie lawyer who is moving to hawaii for L-O-V-E. icing on the cake: my sis had a $150 gift certificate. we killed it. my not so eloquent but to the point analysis (copied and pasted from an email to friend): malbec: yum! my go-to red wine now.king crab mac + cheese: my absolute favorite. i want to come back here just to order this as my dinner. there were some huge chunks of crab.bone marrow: interesting. not sure if i was eating fat or what but the flavor was different. i liked the use of sea salt.wood fired tavern steak (my entree): it was a safe bet. i just needed some serious protein for the night and hadn eaten red meat in a while. i liked that they sliced it for me.blue foot chicken: chicken is chicken. eh, i didn care so much that this was the equivalent of kobe beef. but i did like the skin though. yum. quail: wow. this had serious flavor. if i was getting poultry, i would get this one.ribs: yummy. as expected very tender.crab cakes: i love the remoulade sauce!veal cheek: another interesting dish. it was like a shepherd pie. foodie lawyer was digging through the never-ending folds of mashed potatoes trying to find the meat. haha. nice touch of sweet potatoes. lobster: impressive portion and flavor.bdt triple deck fries: HUGE fries! one was enough for me. they supposedly cook it in duck fat, but i was just underwhelmed since i was expecting some intense fanciful flavors. fingerling potatoes: came with some kind of fried chunky bacon pieces, divine!!!bok choy: usualsweet potato n goat cheese grits: it was an interesting combination and i did enjoy the creaminess. but nothing beats the one i had at tabard inn.ice cream: good gracious, it came in like a huge frosted beaker with an equally big wooden spoon sticking out. 3 healthy scoops. i liked my flavor, coffee hazelnut, the best!loved the decor. there were so many glass panels i was sure i would walk smack dab into one. also liked the style of the chairs. very eames-like yet comfortable. i saved the menu. there was a quote on the bottom by thomas jefferson: taste cannot be controlled by law. no idea what that means, but it was a great dining experience and i had to have documentation., We went to the Blue Duck Tavern last night for my birthday (we will not say which one) and had a wonderful time. I was really excited when my man-friend told me we were going there, because I missed out going with his parents a couple of months ago (I had food poisoning- yuck). I love the decor- very modern meets homey/farmhouse. I like it- not too stuffy or uptight. It fits very well with the locally sourced foods and home style preparation and presentation. We started with Sidecars- an excellent cocktail that can either be very good or very bad. These were very good and very strong. So, strong that I didn have a glass of wine with dinner for fear that I wouldn make it into work the next day. That was a bit of a bummer because of the gigantic wine list they have. Next time, Gadget! Next time!So onto the food, we both had the Boston Lettuce salad with hazelnuts and a mustard vinigrette. It was excellent- but so huge that you could easily split it. Then I had the vegetarian option- it was half a spaghetti squash with wheat berries, chanterelle mushrooms, brussels sprouts. Overall it was very good, but you needed to make sure that you had a bite of squash with the mushrooms. They were pretty salty (I think soaked in soy sauce) and a little overpowering. But they balanced well with the sweet squash. I didn even come close to eating it all and the server was great about boxing it up. My Man-friend had the pork (he had a very hard time deciding- so much meat, so little time!) after he heard the server say it was brined. He likes brined. It was an enormous amount of very pretty pork. He also had to declare defeat and request a doggie bag. Oh and for a side we had the carrots. We originally wanted the braised leeks, but they were out (early in the night, too). The carrots were nice and buttery and beautiful and paired well with both of our meals. As a bit of an aside, the couple dining next to us ordered the Angry Trout, It did indeed look angry and I would too, if my tail were puled through my mouth. It was quite the show piece and we all gawked at it. The guy who ordered it seemed to enjoy the angry little guy quite a bit. It was quite amazing looking.Now for dessert! Ahhhh dessert! My favorite part of any meal and this wasn just any meal it was my Birthday. (Thank god Man-friend did not tell them that it was my birthday. I hate that.) So, we ordered the Made to order Chocolate Cake with Bourbon. It comes to your table in a flaming ball of wonderment (our Angry Trout friends were quite impressed). I totally was not expecting it to be on fire and surprisingly it burned for quite some time. We also had the hazelnut coffee ice cream . It came in a frozen ice bucket with a wooden spoon to serve with. (It made me feel a little better about my presentation at our dinner parties and it was cute.) I had a Latte- excellent. Man-friend had a Knob Creek on the rocks (who Birthday was it?) and that bartender has quite a heavy hand. Thanks bartender! So, back to the sweets, it was great! The bourbon helped to give a nice dimension to the intense chocolate of the cake. We both agreed that we would have it again. The food was really great. The service was excellent (our server was a fantastically witty man named Mike- I loved him.) Plus, it was very reasonable for locally sourced fancy-pants food. All in all a fantastic birthday!, My experience at Blue Duck Tavern was nothing short of excellent, the food was perfectly cooked and he decor was modern and posh. Noting the decor and trendiness, I was actually very surprised at the quality of the service. Our waiter was friendly, pleasant, helpful yet unobtrusive. But while service is important, no one reads reviews for anything except to hear about the food. So hear it is: my meal was excellent and I cant wait to go back.I had the scalllops and the duck. My date had the steak and we shared the BDT triple deck fries and the king crab mac and chesse.The scallops were delicious and juicy. The appetizer included three large scallops, although I could have eaten about thirty. My mouth waters just thinking about them.The duck was delicate yet flavorful. The presentation was well done, with slices lining the plate and a juicy leg on the side. the meat was as tender as i have ever had. I would recomend this dish to anyone who goes to BDT.The King Crab Mac + Cheese was absolutely fabulous and is much like the Lobster Mac and Chesse side dish that they have at Capital Grille.If you have never had it, I would order the BDT triple deck fries: as they are HUGE and tasty and a little different than most. That being said, I was glad I tried them but likely wouldnt order them again. t nothing beats the one i had at tabard inn.The hanger steak was delicious, but usually when i go to a restaurant with such an interesting and unique menu (tunique and interesting twists to your standard fare) I tend to order something different.Overall this place is worth the extra money you are paying for a restaurant in a hotel. The food is excellent and the service was perfect. Two thumbs up., Wow, that was amazing. A few weeks later, I can stop talking about it. I went here for brunch with my father, sister and the lovely Miriam W. We ordered more than anyone could even hope to eat, but it was fantastic. I have to say that some things about this restaurant are stereotypical upscale DC. Specifically, he wait and host staff are overly friendly to the point where you want to slap them a little bit and yell treat me like a normal human being! The brunch started out with the trout appetizer. I would have never ordered it if Miriam hadn insisted that it was the greatest thing ever. So we ordered it and it was amazing! There was a lot of it too, I think we weren able to finish it. It a bit salty and really full flavoured but oh-so-good. The table then shared the braised beef, chicken, crab cakes, sausage, grits, potatoes and a spinach-like veggie that was fantastic. Like I said, we ordered WAY more than we could possibly eat. But we couldn help it, everything on the menu looked so amazing, and when we got the food, it didn disappoint at all!I think the braised beef was a table favourite. It melted off the bone and in your mouth. It was full of flavour and incredibly tender. Amazing. The chicken was very well seasoned and put a new twist to chicken. You would think that you have had chicken every which way, but this was good stuff! Crab cakes... mmm crab cakes. They were juicy with huge lumps of crabs in them. Combine that with a great mixture of spices and you can imagine how these tingled the corners of your mouth. The sausage was interesting. It came with sauerkraut, which was very well done. Not the sweet American kind that you find, claiming to be German. So now we get to the surprise. The grits. I mean, I don like grits. They suck ass. They taste like cardboard and whatever you decide to put in it. I never saw the point in eating them. When Miriam ordered the grits, I have her a look. It was the I don think I want to be associated with you anymore look. But then the grits came out. They were amazing. They were a combination of garlic, oil and butter. It has a yellow tint and the oil was swimming on the top of it. It was full of flavour and tasted nothing of the crap you get elsewhere. I actually wanted more. It was pure comfort food. I was converted. For dessert, we had apple pie. It was amazing. It came with ice cream that came in a frosted vat and was served with a wooden cooking spoon. One thing I thought was cool that they didn scoff when we said we wanted to take the leftovers home. There was enough to feed my father and me again for lunch the next day and be totally satisfied. They packed the things up and the food was waiting for us at the door. Obviously, this was a fantastic food experience and I can wait for my next trip to DC to do this all over again!, WORST! SERVICE! EVER!Wow - I am utterly shocked by these high reviews. Our experience was pretty awful. Well, actually, the ambiance is really nice, and the food was pretty good. Normally I would probably go for 4 stars. But, the service was a DISASTER. I made a reservation the day before. I indicated to the host that we would be 3 adults, 2 children. All they had available was 6 or 9:30 pm, which was interesting because the place was 1/2 empty while we were there from 6-8:30 pm. We arrived. The restaurant was mostly empty. They sat us in a remote corner at a huge table isolated from the entire restaurant. The host faulted us for saying we were 5 adults when we called, which was not true. (They later contradicted themselves by saying that 5 is the magic number - it you have five there is nowhere to sit b/c Hyatt policy doesn allow you to change the architecture of the room) We asked to be moved to the main dining room. The manager came - condescending as Hell - and offered to move us outside to the 90 degree heat. We insisted NO, and he pressed us to the point where it was uncomfortable. He kept on reiterating that is all he could do for us and acted like he was bending over backward to put us at a 4-seater in the sweltering heat, whilst half the restaurant and patio were empty. We ordered a variety of appetizers and dinners. About 20 minutes later, we received one small appetizer of tomatoes. About 40 minutes elapsed without any contact with waitstaff. I was upset, and sought the condescending manager attention. The condescending manager came over like we were crazy b/c nobody had acknowledged us in our little isolated corner for 40 minutes and told us this is how long the food takes to come to the table normally. It took another 15 minutes for the food to actually come. This 40-55 minute preparation time is bunk because another asst. manager came over and apologized because the kitchen was swamped. We also saw multiple parties come and go in the time that we waited. The food was pretty good, especially the wild salmon and swiss chard, and scallops. The market fish (some kind of sea bass) was everybody least fave - in that it was simultaneously bland and fishy. However, to give Caesar what belongs to Caesar, in general, the food was fresh, tasty, and seasoned well.Though we were visibly irked by the terrible service, and made it known numerous times, the staff made absolutely no concession. My sister felt bad about giving only a 15% tip, which I insisted on. Though she then realized that she had no idea who our waiter was. I will not go back if I can help it. That is, until that AWFUL condescending manager gets fired. He truly is awful., Let me start out by saying Blue Duck only made the jump from 4 stars to 5 because of the service. The food was extremely well done, but somewhat ordinary. I had trouble finding something on the menu that looked unique and tasteful. The service, however, was on par with the best I have ever experienced. Everything was perfect. Next time you are eating someplace, watch your water glass. See how often it goes unattended. This a very basic thing that is often overlooked that you can use to rate service. Our water glasses didnt even get close to being dry. Nor did the tables on either side. Things were presented beautifully by the staff and quickly and accurately cleaned. I think I had just finished chewing my last bite and sat back in my chair when my plate magically disappeared and the table was instantly wiped clean. The staff was courteous and knowledgeable about the menu and, more surprisingly, the wine list. As I mentioned, the food was excellent, but seemed to lack an imaginativeness that the best restaurants share. They do recognizable things in new and incredible ways. Blue Duck serves recognizable dishes in recognizable but tremendously well done ways. Go for the service. It will raise your bar of what great establishments are all about., Let me begin by stating that this review is for the Sunday Brunch at Blue Duck - not their dinner.My experience began circa 12pm on a Sunday. A couple of friends of mine wanted to meet for brunch/lunch at Blue Duck (they are big fans of dinner there) and had gone about setting up reservations for our party via OpenTable. When we arrived at the restaurant the hostess could not locate our reservation and we were left to wait for close to 15-20 minutes while a table was prepared. Luckily they have some comfy rocking chairs in the lobby so we were mildly appeased by this. After loudly talking about how they could have lost our reservation and mentioned to one another comments such as How long could it possibly take to set up a table we were finally seated.The menu wasn the greatest nor the worst menu I have seen for brunch. I was expecting a little more but overall there were a few things that caught my eye. Our server - some young lad with a really horrible fake French accent took his time getting to us even though it was apparent we were ready for drinks. He swung by and took our drink order. We didn see him for another 10 or so minutes. By the time our drinks had arrived we were parched and quite ready to order. By the time the food arrived we had gone through all of our drinks and refills on the water and most importantly the alcohol were no where to be seen. Apparently there was some VIP next to us because god knows they were getting a lot better service than us.When the servers brought our food, they delivered the entrees to the wrong persons and we were forced to reshuffle the plates and sides - totally unacceptable in my opinion. They did not even mention the names of the entrees as they put them down - they just went ahead and dropped them wherever they wanted. Luckily for us, the food was rather tasty and I did enjoy the mushrooms. Our check came to be $150 for three persons - a bit on the high side but still less than the $80 brunch at the Four Seasons which is phenom-gorge (includes alcohol). This brunch did not include alcohol.It is unfortunate that the horrible service and experience will prevent me from going back to Blue Duck. I think Il stick with my usual Brunch at the Washington Monarch though I think now it is called the Fairmont. At least there the servers are attentive, polite, and ready to provide quality service., I just took my boyfriend here for his birthday. We had a fabulous time and the food was excellent. Expensive: Yes, Worth It: AbsolutelyGreat place for special occasions and for non-picky eaters. Not good for a girls night out but great for business meals and special occasions. The menu changes often and what sounds strange is probably VERY tasty., Made a reservation online via OpenTable and had no problem being seated -- granted, it was 6:30pm on a Wednesday -- but still, I had been a little concerned given the varied reviews here. My experience with the service at the Blue Duck Tavern was excellent, and the restaurant is beautiful. My friend and I commented that it would be a great date spot, and that the outdoor seating would be extra-romantic (as long as youe not in the throes of August heat and humidity).We started with the:1. bone marrow. This being my first marrow experience, I not sure whether it was amazing or not -- I got the heebie geebies with the gelatinous texture (I know, Priss!), but the flavor was great and it came with roasted garlic cloves and fresh rosemary. We then shared the:2. crab cakes (delish, full of lump crab meat with little filler, and a great remoulade sauce)3. braised rib (meat falling off the bone and with a rich flavorful sauce -- this was my favorite food of the evening)4. pickled tomatoes (ok but didn knock my socks off - Ie had much more flavorful tomatoes)5. grits with goat cheese (oh so creamy - wonderful)And we ended with the:6. Apple pie a la mode. Award-winning, so perhaps my expectations were too high? I admit it was pretty great -- an individually-sized pie, meaning you get extra crust (and it GOOD crust), and the 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream served in its separate bucket were lovely... but I always prefer a bit of tartness to my apple pie (I use granny smith apples when baking at home), and these apples were in fabulous big chunks but were sweet and not tart. Therein lies my disappointment. If you like sweet apple pie, youl be in heaven.Overall, it was a great experience. But nothing jumped out at me from the menu, and the prices seemed a tad steep. I would go again in the future, but not before I try a bunch of other great places in the meantime, ya know?, Loved the sprawling layout and open kitchen. Food was quite good, but nothing truly spectacular.Our service was sort of bad, but we were in a mood not too mind. One server was obviously being trained and not big on speaking English. He won last more than a couple weeks I am sure. It is in a hotel, so I am guessing they need French speakers for international guests. Our main server was really bizarre and a bit inappropriate. When he came to bring us dessert menus he leaned down conspiratorially and whispered that he was Going to turn us on. A little weird seeing as I was with my boyfriend and my mother. But we laughed about it later. One thing that annoyed me- If you order a mixed drink, they bring you a tall glass of ice and liquor and a mini bottle of tonic/soda/whathaveyou. It just looks kind of tacky sitting on the table., This restaurant is cool. How cool? Cool as in when you go to the bathroom, you walk through the very open kitchen (not even a counter separation between it and the rest of the restaurant), stand in front of what appears to be a wall, press a button, and the wall slides open. And yes, the ladies bathroom is split up into individual stalls, each one with their own large mirror and sink area.But enough on bathrooms! On to the food!Free Bread: Points for soft butter in a substantial amount. Nothing worse than little hard tabs of butter. Minus points for cold bread. Im a big fan of hot bread and soft butter, so this was just eeeh. Not that the free bread basket should sway someones mind, but still...if youre going to be paying this much, its good to know!Crabcake appetizer: Done very very well. Crab meat was appropriately large enough with filler being appropriately small. Remoulade sauce was lick your plate amazing. As Blue Duck Tavern is probably too cool of a place to do that, I instead opted to wipe the sauce off with my bread and eat it that way. Very yummy. Price is still a bit steep however with you getting only one crab cake for $15. Tomato Salad Thingy: I didnt actually eat this, so instead I will say that the presentation on this dish was incredibly pretty. Food Gourmet magazine pretty. Beef Short Rib: Enough has been said about this dish on other Yelp reviews. But in case youre too lazy to read the other ones (and have somehow grasped onto only mine for who knows what reason), 5 pieces of meat on a giant bone. Mmm....fall off the bone delicious. With excellent jus. Well worth $23.Grits with Goat Cheese: Aaaaagggghhh...so amazingly buttery, melty, good. Not gritty or grit tasting at all! Would it be wrong for me to go back and only order a side of grits? Amazing deal at however much it cost. $8? So good. Get it. Now. Mail me some. Dessert: Chocolate Custard...is..huge. No really. Its huge. Half of it is still sitting in my fridge. I dont understand how that thing only cost $8. At a bakery somewhere, that would be at least $15--and trust me, I stalk bakeries. Light custard and surprisingly not overly sweet as the bittersweet chocolate shines through. Is also actually better the second day around after having sat in my fridge.Ice cream: Again, I didnt try this...but there is a lot of ice cream in that bucket they bring out to the table. I suspect that my partner and I were supposed to share desserts instead of each ordering our own. But ah well. More happiness and yummy in the tummy for everyone. Service: Excellent. Good wine recommendations with the meal. Water glasses appropriately filled before they got too low. Escort to the bathroom. Folding the napkin of the person who had left for the bathroom so it wasnt in a pile on the table (Im a fan of this). Plus the take home bag for the leftovers was no cheap plastic bag either.Overall, not a bad deal. This is essentially simple food done right. In other words, a raising of the bar as to what food should taste like when cooked properly. Prices were definitely reasonable (especially for the large desserts and entrees....I mean really, 20-25 is not bad for a main course) with the possible exception of the appetizers. If I were going to do it again, Id skip the appetizer and just tack on more sides., I took my husband here for a special birthday dinner last week, and we both thoroughly enjoyed the experience. A few notes:The Atmosphere: The restaurant space is light and airy, with soaring ceilings and large glass windows overlooking their outdoor patio, but the rustic dark wood furniture and open kitchen overflowing with fresh produce and a roaring oven lend warmth and coziness. We asked to be seated at a quieter table, and were given a table in a relatively private nook with another table that remained empty until we were finished with dinner. The rest of the space seemed pretty noisy with chatter, but we had no problem having a distraction-free conversation between ourselves.The Food: Fantastic. We had foie gras as a starter (alas, no bone marrow on the current menu), followed by braised beef and crab cakes with sides of gourmet mushrooms and the most heavenly goat cheese grits I have ever tasted in my life. The foie gras was very good, but didnt blow me away. The braised beef was very good, tender and falling off the bone, but again not a life changer. The crab cakes were moist and tender and just stuffed full of fresh chunks of crab meat. The mushrooms were divine, and well, Ive already told you about the grits - I really had to stop myself from licking the serving bowl. Overall, not overly complicated food with lots of big fresh flavor. Alas, we did not have dessert, but based on the faces of those around us who did, it is not to be missed.The Service: Perfect. I was a little worried by some of the complaints lodged by other Yelpers, but the staff treated us so well from start to finish. Our servers were prompt, helpful, and friendly, and the little touches they added to celebrate my husbands birthday were very thoughtful and generous. No complaints.Overall: Four stars for a delicious meal, impeccable service in a lovely, sophisticated space. Worthy of a special occasion when you want a meal that is decadent and sophisticated but not obnoxious or overly complicated. Well definitely be back again - after all, we still havent tried that infamous bone marrow., Its pretty good and the outdoor seating is really nice. It isnt the best ever though, thats for sure., This review is for the Bar only. I used to work across the street from this place and on occasion my coworkers and I would venture in there for an after work drink and some cheese. They have a cheese bar, which I love! The drinks are good - they are quite expensive though so I liked it for one or 2 drinks MAX. What I really liked was that I love dirty martinis with bleu cheese stuffed olives and apparently that is hard to come by. Well, they typically dont have bleu cheese stuffed olives, but this occasion they made them for me and my friend. Its kind of nice that customer service still exists!, The Blue Duck Tavern, the signature restaurant of the Park Hyatt Hotel at 24th and M Streets in the West End, delivers American cuisine crafted in an old fashioned European hotel style. Let cut to the chase: This is a pricey restaurant, best enjoyed on an expense account. We visited it recently when we decided to make brunch outdoors the only meal for a Sunday. We opted for a table under one of the large patio umbrellas. At 2:00 p.m., the Blue Duck outdoor terrace was an otherwise charmless sunken courtyard framed by a large raised multi-tier fountain. The birds liked the fountain. We enjoyed watching the birds. Diners arrived wearing jeans, shorts, and flip-flops. One emptied his shopping bags and left the trash at his table. (So much for the concept of business casual.) Our server was a young Frenchman just finishing four months in the United States perfecting his English. He was personable and very knowledgeable about the preparation of each of the dishes, and his service was unrushed. The brunch menu is hefty, moving seamlessly from Belgian waffles and eggs-anystyle to steaks and chops, but the wine list is truly enormous. Care to start your meal with a $280 glass of wine? The Blue Duck Tavern offers one. We demurred in favor of two $12 glasses of cabernet sauvignon. All of the dishes our server brought us were sizable, rich with butter and cream, and -- especially to fans of Escoffier -- perfectly prepared. We shared a Maryland soft-shelled crab sauteed in butter, a pateof smoked mackerel and creme fraiche with capers on yeasty French country bread, a smallish fresh jumbo crabcake in remoulade sauce, an oversized helping of spaghetti squash in butter and herbs, and a piece of apple pie with caramel sauce -- really a French apple tart on steroids -- and every dish was excellent and fattening. In a return to reality, the bill for brunch for two nudged into three-figure territory, and but for that I would have considered giving the restaurant another star. For a special-occasion brunch outdoors, preferably on an expense account, the Blue Duck Tavern delivers., A colleague and I took a job candidate out for an interview lunch, which seems to be a popular use for this venue. Id heard mixed reviews about this place, mostly related to the service. We, however, had no service-related issues.On to the food. We started with the bresaola and a green salad. The bresaola had a nice flavor; the greens were peppery and well-dressed. On to the entrees. I had the roast chicken, my colleague had the scallops, and our candidate had the braised short ribs. We shared the carrots and the fries as sides (the sides are served family style, as were the appetizers). The carrots were terrific. The fries couldve been better. I would go with something else. Next time, perhaps Ill try the roast mushrooms (if theyre still on the menu). The chicken was very, very tender and juicy, and well flavored with a hint of tarragon and a nice lemony jus. I picked up only a touch of the rosemary sprig that was on the side. Dessert: I had strawberry rhubarb ice cream, colleague--the goats milk custard, candidate--banana peanut butter ice cream. I also had a cappuccino. The cappuccino was inferior in a way that tainted the rest of my dessert. The milk was scalded and Im not sure what sort of espresso they were using. As for the ice cream, the servings were colossal, the flavor acceptable. The strawberry rhubarb was sweet and creamy but really nothing to write home about. The banana peanut butter wasnt that great, and I didnt chance the custard. Next time I think Ill try the apple pie (again, if its still on the menu). I saw some cooling in the open kitchen--by the way, Blue Duck is a nicely designed space--and they looked delicious.Anyway, its one of the better restaurants around my workplace (Id rather be closer to Metro Center, these days), so Im sure Ill head back and update my review once Ive tried more of the menu., really nice, we went just when it opened. i had the housemade brats and they were a texture like no other ive ever had. highly recommend., Blue Duck was a nice restaurant, however I must say that I was disappointed. I must be spoiled since I am from the San Francisco Bay area (restaurant mecca), but the ratings in both zagat and yelp seem inflated.I was told the place was romantic, however it really depends on where they choose to seat you. From where we were seated, there was no fireplace in sight and the open kitchen was obstructed by a divider in the center of the room. The different seating areas are odd... it like multiple restaurants in one large area. And, on top of that, the service was inattentive and cold. The food was also hit or miss. The crabcake, which was recommended by the waiter, was EXTREMELY fishy. I cringe thinking about it. My boyfriend steak (the most expensive item on the menu if I recall) was probably the worst thing we ate there. The texture was off, the meat quality wasn good, and their cooking method was suspect. Onto the highlights: The spatzle mac and cheese was delicious and indulgent, the lamb shank was well-cooked, the mashed potatoes were very creamy, and the fries were unique and enjoyable. The concept behind the meal is interesting: a la carte, sharable portions for every menu item. It kind of reminds me of Thomas Keller Ad Hoc in Yountville, CA... except that is about 30 times better. Overall, it is a decent dining experience if you order the right thing, get seated in the right areas, and go there on a good night., Often times, restaurant designers choose modernity over functionality. The design on paper seems splendid, but when the restaurant is done, it is too stuffy, or too casual, or (gasp) too blase. This is my feeling about the newly designed Corduroy. The food is fantastic, but the atmosphere is both a tad stuffy and overly uninteresting for a restaurant of that magnitude.Blue Ducks designers, on the other hand, should be lauded for envisioning a place that is both invitingly proper, casually formal, and generally just warm all around. Giant doors open into a lightly colored stage that looks out over much of the restaurant. There is a beautiful hearth off center near trays of fresh bread that activate your salivary glands as you enter. The open windows and patio make it feel secluded, despite the fact that it is in a high traffic area. We ate out on the patio because it was such a nice night and it felt neither noisy nor as if we were being intruded on by pedestrian traffic. The fountains gush certainly helps.The food was also quite good. The Yelptastic community recommended this place and it did not disappoint. Highlights of the meal: the beet salad that had an amazing egg and something topping; the goat cheese grits that - for a person who doesnt care for a grit, let along many grits - was so decadent and creamy; the main duck course with a crispy, pastrami like skin that perfectly complemented the supple breast meat; and the lamb. Honestly, this is a treat of a restaurant and most definitely worth the money spent. Thank you yelpers for your assistance in this find. I will be going back!, If the restaurant owners actually cared about this review, they couldn be happier with the night I was there. It was an absolutely beautiful spring evening which allowed us to have dinner seated outside at Blue Duck. Blue Duck features one of the more interesting menus that Ie seen. You have appreciate the freshness that comes with the seasonal ingredients they feature, but I a little gunshy about a few items offered (e.g. hot pigs trotter). And I definitely was thankful for the plate of freshly sliced prosciutto that was given to us shortly after our basket of bread. I not normally one to indulge in the seafood selections when I have other options, but I figured when I that close to Maryland I would do myself a disservice by not getting the Jumbo Lump Crabcakes. The crab cake entree was two substantially-sized crab cakes with plenty of crab meat in each. They were very good, but I must admit that they were nothing compared to the Wood Fired Diver Maine Scallops, which were easily the best scallops Ie ever eaten. Consider that Ie already stated I don eat much seafood, but I love scallops. For sides we went potato times two. The Roasted Fingerlings with bacon and onion were maybe a little under seasoned, but nothing that couldn be addressed table-side. Or maybe they were very good but overshadowed by the Hand Cut BDT Triple Fries which were delicious, though I did wonder what might be a fun dipping sauce for them. When you walk into Blue Duck, you are conveniently herded past the station where their popular apple pies are prepared. They recommend one to share, and it is plenty big enough for two people. Would you like vanilla ice cream with that? Of course I would. A small, nearly-personal pie with a delicious caramelized brown sugar top served with three big scoops of vanilla ice cream. I guess I should mention the bottle of 2005 Montes Alpha Cabernet Sauvignon from Chile that we had. It, as well as everything served, knocked my socks off., This is a beautiful restaurant located in West End. The entrance is off of a major street, so it nice and peaceful as you approach the big blue doors to go inside. Once inside, the restaurant is very tranquil -- high ceilings, nice open space, good street view, not too loud at all.I love the interior, and how the kitchen is open. To get to the bathroom, you actually walk through the kitchen itself, and chefs are there working.In regards to the food, everything was of top quality. My problem, however, is that it simply didn taste amazing. Take the starters, such as the fisherman soup, which consists of one small cup of fish broth, two mussles and one clam. At 9 dollars, one would expect some fish...not just three (small) pieces of shell fish. To be blunt, it just does not taste incredible either, and even worst, the broth isn served all that hot. The entr39es are better, but again, not fab. Take the beef short ribs, considered by many to be the standout entree. They are tender, and delicious, but frankly are they any better than the short ribs at Daily Grill? It would be hard to discern between the two in a blind taste test. To hone down this point, the scallops are tasty, big, and fresh, but the fennel sauce really throws off the subtlety of the scallops, and it is a dish that could easily have come off the menu of another restaurant that is of lesser quality. As for the sides (which are all al la carte), the garlic mashed potatoes are creamy, but where is the garlic? The other sides were also vin ordinaire, especially the fries, which are crispy and good but pale in comparison to the frites at Les Halles.The desserts are a mixed bag. The ice cream is really delicious, and it is served in a freezing bowl with a salad serving spoon. The chocolate fondant cake is also fantastic, and the presentation is terrific. But the caramel custard lacks the creaminess and sweetness of a delicious caramel custard and its presentation is average at best.In short, the food is of high quality, but the presentation and flavors are a mixed bag. Furthermore, the items on the menu lack a creativity that other restaurants of similar quality offer. The chefs here played it safe (a couple of beef dishes, fish dishes, a pasta...) and they can only be paired with similarly boring sides. Many lesser quality restaurants offer similar dishes.As for the service, it was extremely attentive, but they made plenty of errors -- dishes were served to the wrong people (or didn even come out at all until we told them), and what really bugged me is that they served the coffee and tea well after we had finished our desserts. All in all, this is a fine restaurant, and you will certainly not be disappointed. However, if this restaurant were in NY, Paris, San Francisco, or LA, it would be considered quite average. I love DC, but the food here is really not up to the standards of those other great cities, and this restaurant, which is considered one of the best, confirms this belief., The french fries are so good. They blow McDonalds french fries out of the water. The place is pretty pricey, but it is worth it. Ive had dinner here a couple of times and everything is delicious. The service is great-they are very attentive to your needs. Ive also had drinks inside and the cheese plates are delicious. They have the greatest selection of cheese., I think there appears to be 2 traditional styles of writing your 100th review. The first is to write about something quirky, funny or random, such as an Exxon station or your own ass, and the second is to do something really memorable and satisfying. I have decided to go with the latter, and the Blue Duck Tavern for my 28th birthday dinner is the lucky recipient. It all the more memorable because I got to dine once again with my favorite companion, Nicole, who makes every meal more special for me, but the really great ones I would hate to eat without her. Last night she looked like 6 stars, and it a gift in itself to be the guy in the restaurant with the girl that everyone else looks at. I am a damn lucky man, and not soon to forget it.I don typically ask for a lot on my birthday, if anything at all, but the one thing I do want is to have a really great meal along with fantastic wine. Luckily my cellar at home means the second part usually only costs me a corking fee, which happens to be the standard $25 here, and the choice for the night was Andre Brunel Les Cailloux Chateauneuf du Pape Centenaire from 2001. It could have easily sat another 10 years before opening, but I couldn resist last night, and I was so glad I chose it once I saw the menu. I scoured for quite a while trying to find the perfect spot to eat, something near the edge of the culinary scene, but still traditional enough to be somewhat familiar. The chefs at Blue Duck delivered the meal part spot on, and while it wasn the best Ie had in DC, it was nearly flawless in its delivery.The family style servings here are not what I consider your normal restaurant family style, so don expect a huge bowl of anything that you can split between the entire table. They are however a genius idea if there is just a pair of you, because it makes sharing these wonderful creations so much easier. Even the meat is pre-sliced for you, so you can just use the tongs and serve some to your partner. We tried to photograph as much as possible, so you can hopefully tell exactly what kind of portion sizes to expect.Up first were the two appetizers we ordered, the pumpkin custard with huckleberries, rosemary and pumpkin seed praline & the mustard spaetzle mac and cheese with duck confit. They were both rock solid, outstanding dishes. The pumpkin custard had a really nice bitter tartness to it, and the praline on top gave it almost a creme brulee type texture. The spaetzle with duck confit was heavenly. I could have just ordered 2 of these for dinner and been very content. They do not skimp on the amount of duck in this dish at all, and the bread crumbs retain a good bit of moisture so it really tender to eat, very much like a really expensive and delicious casserole. I want the recipe!For dinner we decided to go with the smoked duck breast with confit of leg & the braised beef rib. We also ordered the heirloom grits with bleu cheese & the vegetable of the day which was broccoli rabe. After reading several other reviews I was expecting to be blown away by the grits, especially given my affinity for anything bleu cheese related, but in the end they turned out to still be much like what you expect from grits. I guess it hard to turn some things into what theye not, but don let that deter you from ordering them, they are still quite good, just not life changing. The broccoli rabe was the one mistake of the night. I have tried the vegetable before, and I know it is supposed to have some bitterness to it, but this serving was completely off the charts. It literally ruined my taste buds for the rest of the dishes, thankfully there was plenty of water to rinse with. Fortunately BDT redeemed themselves with the two meat courses. The duck breast was some of the best I have had, and the layer of fat was absolutely perfect, with a great spice flavor. The confit was a little disappointing, and tasted sort of like duck BBQ, but it was still good. The braised beef was phenomenal, as it should be considering it takes three days to prepare. There is no need for a knife here, this meat just falls apart at the touch, and they even give you a spoon to get out all the extra sauce in the bottom of the pan.We were so full we could have easily stopped after the main courses and been content with our heavy caloric intake of the night, but it just so hard to pass on dessert, especially when you can see them making the pastries as soon as you walk into the restaurant. We took the advice of another Yelper and went with the apple pie and the cranberry white chocolate ice cream. Both were incredibly delicious and a fitting ending to a very filling night.As others have said, the decor here is second to none in DC, and the atmosphere is great. Unlike others, our service was fantastic in both the lounge and the restaurant, and we got the table we requested right in front of the kitchen, which was a spectacular, unique view in such a nice establishment., We screwed up. We were much too proud about our comfort with family-style eating that we misjudged our choices, which tainted our experience at Blue Duck Tavern. Get ready for it...Our meal was...mediocre. (Oh, it hurts...)I was so excited to come to Blue Duck Tavern last Friday that I had it on my profile for more than a week. After reading some of my favorite yelpersreviews, I knew that we were in for a treat. During his week-long visit in DC, I wanted to make our one night out something really, really special. So we got dressed up, found the best parking space (avoiding the $10 valet fee) and got seated by some super friendly hosts right away.Alexander, whose sole job seemed to be to tell people about the menu in excruciating detail, came over and - you guessed it - told us about the menu in excruciating detail. Since it was our first time there, he explained to us how everything is served on casserole dishes that go in the middle of the table to share. He also highlighted a good number of dishes and told us a lot about them. Our server then came and took our order. Here what I would change if I could: we ordered the Mustard Spaetzle Mac and Cheese for our appetizer, and for our entree, I got the Rack of Black Berkshire (pork), and he got the Braised Beef Rib. As a grits-lover, I couldn help ordering the Heirloom Grits w/ Goat Cheese for a side. So let think about it. Mac & cheese for our appetizer, and for our main course, we have a huge slab of beef, two huge slabs of pork, and cheesy grits. Can you say heavy? Can you say meat overload?? Don get me wrong - the food was great. The mac was of course different than anything I ever had, the pork didn seem to need any sauce or seasoning because the flavor was pure pig - delicious. The braised beef rib could be torn off the bone with a fork, and it was really tasty. The grits -omg, the grits! - were divine (though it failed to turn my dining partner into a grits lover, which I was hoping for...).Anyway, here my advice. If youe going with a party of two, get an appetizer, decide on ONE entree, and get a number of the side orders. Not only is it a better value, but youl really get to sample some of BDT best, and you won be on a meat overload like we were. We decided not to get dessert since our stomachs were practically mooing and oinking at us, but we were pleasantly surprised to get dark chocolate-covered apple slices with our bill!All in all, a very pleasant experience. Just be careful with what you order!, Maybe its the economy, maybe all the politico types were busy, but the restaurant was maybe half full on Sunday night of a long weekend.Regardless, it was the perfect night to sit outside in their courtyard with their fountain. The space is very spacious and modern. I think Justin Cs review sums my experience up. We also got the duck confit, braised beef, and apple pie, all amazing. Seems like they change their sides seasonally so we ordered the pumpkin which was so fluffy it almost tasted like air. If you like pumpkin (who doesnt at this time of the year?!), this is a must try!Their apple pie was to die for, especially the crust!, What an awesome restaurant is the Blue Duck Tavern!! Firstly, the d39cor is impeccable. It modern without being bleak and warm without being stuffy. The perfect mix between elegant and comfort. Secondly, the service is outstanding. Other Yelpers stated to have received poor service but I have to disagree. The service was extremely attentive but never to the extent of intruding on us. From the second we walked up to the towering entry doors (which they opened for us) all the way to the moment we departed (also opened for us), everything was sensational. This is the level of service I can easily refer to as ideal. I have three words to describe the food: de-li-cious! Dinner was an amazing, taste-exploding meal that can easily qualify as one of the best meals Ie honestly ever had in DC. The generous mustard spaetzle mac and cheese duck confit was rich and delicious and the huge braised lamb shank was fall-off-the-bone succulent and tender. The juices from the shank was so good I was half-tempted to lick them off the serving dish, had I not remembered my surroundings. I scarcely had room for dessert, but I dug down deep and managed to find the space in my distended stomach. I read quite a bit about their apple pie from other Yelpers but I decided to go differently with the bittersweet chocolate cake flamb39ed in a dessert liquour. It was sinfully good and I was now sinfully lethargic. The price of the entire meal was very reasonable, given the food quality and preparation and the level of service we received. This was a stellar dining experience and I have absolutely no gripes to give at all. The only thing I would do differently the next time is to request to be seated near the gorgeous open kitchen and watch, in complete fixation, the chefs work their magic!!, 3-1/2 stars.I went expecting fabulous, but it was something less. Good and enjoyable, but less than fabulous.The room is beautiful. Warm and modern and totally unstuffy. It LOOKS like a high-end restaurant. Service had a kink or two, which is okay except when you are paying almost $300 a couple for dinner. We had timing issues throughout -- nothing major, but for that price it should be better. Example -- I like, and a good restaurant should offer, a cocktail when you sit down. It took a long time for anyone to come to us, and before the waiter took our cocktail order, bread was delivered to the table. Odd.Food was hits and misses. Take the warm beet salad, for instance. The beets were good, but the blue cheese was minimal, the lardon was just a slice of bacon, and the egg ran so that the bottom of the bowl was a soupy gloopy mess. My boyfriend had the spaetzle mac and cheese with duck confit for starters. It had an overwhelming mustard taste that overpowered anything else.Entrees fared better. My boyfriend had the pork shoulder and I had the smoked duck breast. Both were delicious, truly.Sides -- buttered cabbage was a big hit as was the pumpkin gratin.Desserts were good but nothing stood out.Don get me wrong -- I had a really enjoyable evening here, and the restaurant has a great vibe. It just that for the price, I expected something superb, and I was just left a little deflated., We had blue duck tavern a few months ago, they have a very cool kitchen, actually so did some other restaurants in DC. The most striking dish was the fries that was fried from the duck oil, they were the best fries we have ever had at $9, I believe. The entrees were just okay. The salmon was tasteless, so I would not recommend getting that. The steak was okay, not great. The best entree there was the beef shoulder but comparing to other really good french restaurants, it is just decent., My experience was actually very similar to Jim D., even down to the dishes we ordered (braised lamb shank, duck confit, spaetzle mac-n-cheese, warm roasted beets frisee salad with poached hen egg, molton choco-something-yummy, etc.) and the service we received. I always hesitant to listen to anyone else opinion on a restaurant service because I have a very different view of its importance. As long as it doesn hinder or interfere with any of the dishes I order, I don care how (in)frequently a server comes to my table (too frequent is just as annoying as never). I there for the food first. The server at BDT was appropriately available and solicited the right amount of opinion on the dishes when we asked for it.The food was heavy and rich and delicious, exactly what I would expect in a restaurant that calls itself a tavern ...so to speak (i.e., this is a once in a while kind of place where the dishes actually do line your stomach for the cold winter nights to come).My only real complaint (and this hardly constitutes as a complaint) is that they didn have their beloved bone marrow dish on the menu when I went, the one that I heard so much about. Will just look forward to that for next time., Very good, but I was expecting greatness. The food was excellent, but not the best I have had in DC. Portion size was good though, no elf food here. The sides definitely outshined the main courses, although that is no stab at the main courses. My husband loved his hanger steak, and I have no complaints about the lamb. The pumpkin gratin was amazing, beet salad was good but Ive had better. I think the biggest reason it only gets four stars from me is the wine presentation. We were not offered any assistance in selecting a wine, and after it was brought to us and poured, it was just placed on the table. It seems that a place that upscale would spring for a chiller for a bottle of white wine. Good place, but I expected a little more..., Stef and I took advantage of Blue Ducks Saturday brunch in order to try the restaurant without shelling out for dinner. We really are clever that way :-)The kitchen and dining area are all open to each other, and so amazingly clean and minimalist that it is nearly (just nearly) creepily sanitized. There were only a few tables filled, so we received plenty of attention from the servers. In fact, at times, the attention was intrusive. But everyone was so deferential and eager to please that it was easy to forgive them. I started with coffee (mmm, smelled so fresh), and sliced bread (mmmm, also very fresh). We ordered our entrees and decided to split a side dish of mac and cheese. This turned out to be a good decision -- the entrees were of good size, but not ridiculously large, and hence we were able to eat the side dish as well.My Eggs Benedict were cooked perfectly, and served perfectly. Stefs goat cheese and leek quiche tasted exquisite. The mac and cheese spaetzle with duck confit was amazingly rich. We enjoyed all of the flavors.We lingered over our food, and chatted for quite a while, but in no way were made to feel rushed. I have to believe that not many people know that they serve a Saturday brunch, otherwise it would be much busier, and we wouldnt have had the pleasure of relaxing there for so long.One thing is for certain -- I feel confident that I will in fact come back for a special occasion dinner sometime soon, and that I will be happy with the experience. Blue Duck has charmed me with its food and attentive service., Very good. Not five stars, but very good. For appetizer, I got the mustard spaetzle Mac and Cheese duck confit, for my entree I got the crabcakes, and I also had some of the blue cheese grits and a taste of the sturgeon. The crabcakes were not as good as the ones Ie had in Baltimore, but theye pretty darn good and about as good as one is going to get in DC. The mac and cheese was incredibly delicious. The blue cheese grits were okay, maybe a little too rich, as I felt somewhat uncomfortable after eating a lot of them. The sturgeon was decent, but nothing earth-shattering.The decor is pretty nice, if a little crowded. They have an open kitchen, which is neat, and it eerily clean. The service was very good, attentive and encouraging without being officious. They also offered plenty of non-patronizing advice about the wine, which I think is pretty rare. It definitely a fine restaurant, but given the price, I think there are better deals and/or more intriguing cuisines in DC. Il come back at some point, but not before exploring other places first., Second time dining here and can wait for my third. First, the restaurant has such a unique concept - a rustic tavern set in a trendy modern atmosphere. You will find a mixture of colonial rocking chairs and lots of glass. To me, it a pretty surreal environment. The service is very attentive and non-pretentious. You know instantly from walking through the doors that this is a very upscale place - but the servers really make you feel at home and never out of place. Thirdly, the food is spot on. Started out with the mustard spaetzle mac-n-cheese with duck confit. One word: unbelievable. Moved onto the tavern steak with peppercorn steak and triple BDT fries. No complaints here. Dessert delivered a warm chocolate cake with caramelized bananas. My wife got the homemade fudge brownie ice cream served in their trademark glass pitcher with wooden spoon. Blue Duck surprised us with a couple complimentary glasses of Moet Chandon Rose Champagne for our anniversary. Everything was perfect yet again. Even though we swore to keep this place in our special events only pocket - I am hoping to convince my wife for another visit real soon., My parents are very traditional Chinese. They really only appreciate Chinese food, finding western flavoring bland, and the use of ingredients boring. Knowing this, my brother (foodie extraordinaire) and I arranged a dinner with them at Blue Duck Tavern. They gave their unequivocal two (four?) thumbs up!We were able to get a table with a view of the open kitchen. While this was amusing and gave us something to talk about (other then my unwillingness to bear them many many grandbabies, or my brother state of unwedded bliss), I eh on the whole concept - I like my food to magically appear before me, I don find watching the drudgery of my food being prepared as especially tillitating or interesting. The dining room was sparse and serene, and the view of the wine cellar gave Blue Duck their first thumbs up from my father (raging alcoholics that we are).For appetizer, we had the grilled bone marrow, which was succulent and delicious (but be sure to add some of the sea salt that it is served with - our server didn explain, and it makes a world of difference), the fois gras creme brulee (which is not very PC, but who says no to fois gras?) which was a little too sweet for me but my brother enjoyed greatly, and the perfectly fried pork belly, which I will marry as soon as Congress passes a law which will allow me to marry my food. All in all, the appetizers were a great open for the meal - and although I enjoyed my entree hugely, I could have been quite happy just dining on the appetizers alone!For our entrees, my dad ordered the lamb, which was thick and perfectly medium-rare and seasoned with such a careful hand, that he neither needed soy sauce nor hot chili oil to enjoy his dish (and yes, my father will ask for soy sauce - or more accurately, make ME ask for it). My mom had the whole rainbow trout - which seemed to be more of a bass then a trout - but still flaky and moist. My parents did note that the fish was cooked a little longer then they normally like their fish, but I think this is more of an Asian thing, then a problem with Blue Duck cooking methods. Ie noticed that Americans tend to like all of their foods more well-done then Asians. Yes, my parents know this of western cooking, but I refused to ask the waiter to undercook the fish (I could just see the chef spit into our fish with a request like that), so I did get one or two baleful glares from my dad for this dish misstep. I had the cod cheeks which were so flavorful that I could have happily bathed in the sauce like Elizabeth Bathoy, and my brother had the beef short-ribs which were falling off the bone perfect. We were beyond stuffed by the time we were done with our entrees, yet...yet we ordered dessert. The fruit compote was tasty but nothing spectacular, however the chocolate cake with the vanilla ice cream was practically a review in itself. I normally don like chocolate cake (yes, I female, and no, I don crave chocolate cake...chocolate martinis are a different story) because it usually too sweet and rich and heavy. However, this chocolate cake was moist and rich without being heavy. It was a touch sweeter then I liked, especially paired with the homemade vanilla ice-cream, however, the flavors combined so well together, that for once, I understood the allure of chocolate cake a la mode.Our server was quite excellent, despite not explaining how to eat the bone marrow dish. He was cheerful without being annoying, and checked up on us just often enough to make sure that we had a steady flow of wine and water, without being cloying and irritating. Very wisely he waited until after we were finished with our entrees before having a short conversation with us about our meal (I hate it when the wait staff tries to make conversation while I greedily inhaling my food). Full and mellow from the marvelous meal, we allowed him to talk us into ordering more dessert then we could possibly eat. Although, we did finish everything, so perhaps he could see that our bellies were indeed bigger then our eyes., Still Fantastic.I went here for a late dinner after a charity event last night and I must say this is still one of my favorite places in DC. The service is top notch, the decor and atmosphere is sublime, and the menu is ever changing. The chestnut soup was perfect for this time of year and the seared scallops were top notch. This is just a quick update, but if you havent been to BDT recently, or at all, you should go., I am going to echo a review from below: 3 1/2 stars, with the potential to easily hit 4 or 4.5.I took my beau to BDT for his birthday and our meal was wildly up and down. Our table had a good view of the open kitchen (I highly recommend asking for a view); our waiter greeted us promptly; and our cocktails (a pear and elderflower martini) were perfectly balanced and more than adequately strong. The ambiance is soft and presents a nice balance of modernity and country, with handsome touches of marble, chrome, light woods, and glass. Good start.Then the trouble began. It took us a while to figure out what we wanted, and though everything the waiter said was in theory correct (take your time, etc.) his tone became increasing impatient and humorless. To boot, our appetizers were significantly delayed; they took at least 20 minutes longer than they should have. The upside: even though we did not complain, the manager was profusely apologetic, and told us our meal would be accompanied by extras courtesy of the chef. The downside: unfortunately, after three pieces of bread each, the notion of extra food wasn that appealing. The wait was worth it, though: the scallops. Kissed by a light anise sauce and nicely joined with some thinly shaved fennel, giving it just the right amount of textural variety, they tasted of clean, crisp, winter ocean. Probably the best Ie ever had, and the saving grace of the meal. Our second appetizer would have made more sense as a side starch -- the mac and cheese spaetzle, which, with its heavy cream, fatty duck confit, and cheese was far too rich and heavy to be contemplated alone. Delicious, yes, but two bites worth is more than enough Save it for your entrees, and share it with at least two people. The restaurant also gave us a complementary plate of perfect prociutto -- razor thin, soft -- an incongruous addition, but a delicious one nonetheless. The see-saw ride continued: entrees, unlike the apps, arrived immediately, giving us literally no time to digest and reset. Atfer three appetizers, we could have used it. The braised beef was perfectly cooked, served literally falling off the bone -- really the epitome of a wonderful, savory winter dish. The crabcakes were as fresh as Ie tasted, but otherwise unexceptional. They broke apart at the touch of a fork and were served with easily two tablespoons of tartar sauce -- so much that you could not avoid slathering the cakes. A restaurant of this caliber can do more. Our two sides reflected the rest of the topsy-turvey experience: one, the pumpkin gratin, was creamy, subtly spiced, and smartly topped with toasted pumkin seeds. The other, however, BDT french fries, were overcooked, so much so that some of them were actually leathery! French fries are too easy not to get right. Along with a second round of sincere apologies, the chef also sent us a third (!) entree of sausages atop stewed red cabbage. They were smokey and the cabbage was nicely bittersweet and cooked to an excellent consistency; but, again, the dish was incongruous especially because it was so heavy. Unfortunately, all of the food left us overfull and (despite opting for a big doggie bag rather than trying to tackle all of the food), we did not have room for desserts -- which was unfrotunate, because they looked fabulous. The parting touch was emblematic of BDT strengths: while we were waiting for our coats, the hostess saw us eyeing the cookies for sale by the entrance to the restaurant. She remembered that it was my beau birthday, and insisted that he choose a bag of his choice. (Hours later, we tried one, and it was superb.)My advice echoes Ina, below: If youe going with a party of two, get an appetizer, decide on one entree, and get three sides. My advice to the restaurant: when you run into significant timing issues, it makes more sense to comp the appetizers (or course) than to throw more food at the customer -- especially a party of two. Almost 24 hours later I am still full, and one shouldn leave a restaurant feeling like they are going to burst.Like the choreographed presentation of the many small platters at your table, the decor and the service (some quasi-sniffy waitstaff aside) are first-class at Blue Duck Tavern. Some minor fixes, and perhaps a slightly lighter touch with the cream, and it truly would be one of DC best., I love this place. Wonderful food and great service. I have never had a bad meal here. I look forward to eating here everytime., It is hard to explain how well executed this restaurant feels. From the moment you walk in (those doors are unbelievable) to the last sip of coffee, it is excellent. Not flashy or pretentious, just excellent. Though the fish can be good, it is not a seafood place; BDT strengths are in meat & poultry. The menu is ever changing and the wait staff is knowledgeable -- ask them What good tonight and theyl actually give a legit answer.I have occasionally had to wait a little longer than I like for a (reserved) table, but the bar here is a good place to wait and get a head start. The Martinis taste like theye made by a bartender who cares about his craft. And the warm pistachios are a nice touch.Highly recommended., Went on a Sat night to celebrate a friend B.Day. We were a bit early for our table, so we got a chance to look around the restaurant/bar/hotel lobby.Spectacular. My partner made sure to confirm the birthday guest while we walked around. Just before we were seated, we ran into Chef Brian M, who is a friend of some friends and were greeted warmly as we chatted about our friends as well as his new digs. Off to our table and the night feast!While our waiter was cute, he was not the greatest at answering questions about the menu-what were the Autumn Fruits in the Pumpkin Custard app? he did not know and came back saying it varies, but no additional information.. He was somewhat inattentive most of the evening. When we found a wine we liked on the pricey wine list, the sommelier came back to our table to inform us that they were out of our $90 bottle and suggested as a replacement, a $300 bottle! No other options were offered, so we picked out our own . All that being said, the food was OUTRAGEOUSLY wonderful!!! Had th pumpkin custard regardless and it was fantastic. Others at the table had the gravlox and the foie gras apps that were equally yummy!For our mains, I had the steak special-pricey but worth every penny!Others had the Guinea hen roulade which were just succulent.Had to have the BDT fries as my hubby had been there for cocktails before(amazing), and purple turnips and the baked beans w/rabbit confit. The best beans EVER! Dessert was a sampling of homemade ice creams and sauces too good to describe. We were so into the meal that it wasn until we got home that we realized that nothing was done for the birthday boy!So hubby sent an email to the hostess explaining our evening a few days later and she replied immediately with an apology for the missteps of the evening, and we received a call from the manager offering us another dinner, this time on the house as an apology. Cannot WAIT to go back!, Came here for some cocktails and snacks one night with family and friends. First things first, they have the coolest doors to this place - they are like 20 feet tall! It like youe opening the front door of a castle from a Disney movie or something. Once inside, you immediately feel warm and welcome - the decor here is very inviting. They have a big open bakery-type kitchen in the center of the place and it looks to me like a true French boulangerie. Walk to the left and youe got a nice bar, although somewhat awkwardly shaped (it has two parallel bars w/ about 5 seats each, and a whole bunch of wasted space in between - perhaps intentionally). They have these cool private dining rooms that are see-through glass - I know this because I almost walked into one (slight hazard?) I think it pretty cool that you can be seated in your own little private room that is quiet, and yet still catch the scenery of the restaurant and the hustle and bustle. They also have a cool cheese table w/ a big leg of cured pork sitting on it - I was salivating and was very happy when my family ordered the cheese sampler to snack on. I want to eat here, despite the fact that it in the West End which is technically further than I generally go to hang out. I definitely intrigued enough to break my rule of not eating at hotel restaurants because this place is cool!, my favorite place in the entire city!!awesome spot for a date ... service is amazing, and the food is wonderful for both their brunch and dinner. going in the summer is fun when they have open seating on the patio near the fountain., My friends and I had decided to come here for a little celebratory dinner. We thought it was a good new place to try out and we were not disappointed. The restaurant was a little hard to find in the dark. The sign was relatively obscured. Fortunately, we were able to identify the location from the valet of the Park Hyatt. We meandered from the hotel lobby through the maze like path of the bar/lounge area and found our way to the front desk of the restaurant. The establishment is very roomy. The ceilings are high and the decor is very modern and very elegant. The ambiance is high class without being aloof.We started out with some interesting appetizers. We ordered the fishermans soup, bone marrow and winter salad. The soup was served, deconstructed and then combined at the table. The flavor was excellent. The broth reminds me of a bouilleabaise reduction. The bone marrow was decadent and rich. For a carnivore like me, the taste was heavenly. The winter salad had some grilled cornish hen and fois gras that made it rather a standout from the usual salads.I ordered the signature smoke duck, while my friends ordered the peppered steak and vegetable pot pie. The entrees were served on their pan and lets you share with your table mates. My smoke duck was exquisite. It was sliced duck breast served on top of a ragout of dark meats. The duck was succulent and the flavors were outstanding. My friends steak was perfectly prepared. I had a few bites of it and it was very good, but I thought it a little bland. I had expected a little more spice given au poivre treatment. The vegetable pot pie was light, crammed full of vegetable with a nice sauce. I had also ordered a side dish of fennel that was really well-prepared. The light anise/licorice flavor and sweetness really complemented the entrees.edit: oh how could I have forgotten so easily. One of my friends ordered the BDT triple cut fries. The fries were large cuts and deep fried in duck fat. They were O M G, so good. I could feel my arteries clogging up, but there are drugs to take care of that and I MUST have more fries!We finished off our excellent dinner with an apple pie and chocolate cake with ice cream. The apple pie is dutch style. The apple was just the right amount of sweetness with the cinnamon. The chocolate cake was really rich and potent. And the cappuccino was strong and invigorating.The wine is predominantly California wines with some French and a smaller selection of Italian and Australian. We started with Belles Glos pinot noir recommended by the waiter. It was fruity with deep cherry flavors and a short finish. I ordered an additional bottle of Jordan cabernet sauvignon that was fuller body with exceptional tannins and oak. Very chewy. Both wines were very good.I must point out that the service here is exceptional. From the valet, throughout the dinner and to the point that we left, the services were all first class. There were some spotty moments during the dinner with the plates, but the wait staff was exceptionally expedient and rectified it all immediately. This was one of the best dining experience that I have had in DC and is nearly deserving of 5 stars. I reserve the last star because I like to make sure a restaurant is consistent and that requires more patronage., Ive been to Blue Duck a few times, and each time, I am left wondering why people rave about this place.The food sounds delicious from the menu and servers descriptions, sure. But the execution leaves something to be desired. Examples? The fries are soggy and bland. The butter lettuce salad is ordinary at best. The burger is not even close to worth the money. No exaggeration, almost EVERYTHING needs seasoning (which is interesting, considering the tables do not have salt and pepper shakers). I always feel like the food has so much potential but cant quite live up to it.The service is attentive to the point of annoying, including the constant not-so-subtle upsell. But when you actually need something, the staff is MIA! On my last visit, I got halfway through my steak (literally) before I was offered a steak knife, albeit with profuse apologies. The busboy graciously topped off our water glasses -- with tap water, not the sparkling water we already had in them. The sommelier even spilled wine on the table when he was pouring.I want to like Blue Duck, but I just cant. I expect better than this.
8|boqueria-washington|Upon first glance, I was enticed by the clean lines and cool yet inviting ivory and tan color scheme. Compay Segundo was playing (major points for hitting the right notes right away in the sultry category) lightly in the background, setting the stage for an interesting night of tasty Spanish treats. More to follow after I work my way through what the promising young Boqueria has to offer., I had the opportunity to go here tonight(opening night), and what a great find. To sum it up, great food, great service, and great atmosphere but read on to hear more about the food! It is a tapas restaurant where you can see some of the action by the bar. Not your traditional tapas place as they also have cured meats like Serrano and cheeses like Valdeon there, both of which are amazing. I went with a group of 4 people and we ordered multiple dishes to include the lamb meatballs(which we ordered twice!), lamb skewers(awesome), shrimp in olive oil(wow), bacon wrapped dates with Valdeon cheese(holy crap, what a perfect combo of sweet,salty,and sour?, one of my favorites), hangar steak with salsa verde and coarse salt(amazing), and we also had the cojonudo which is a small piece of bread with chorizo and quail egg(very delish), and I almost forgot about the coco mallorquina which is one of their signature flatbreads, and again very different and tasty. We also got desserts and tried the churros with chocolate sauce and the chocolate torte which came with berries and a scoop of ice cream, the inside still gooey with kind of a molten center. The churros fried to perfection with the right amount of sugar coating(not too much) and then of course the nice hot chocolate sauce for dipping. A perfect way to end a great meal. This is definitely a nice new place and we will be back!, Before i start, I will make it very clear that I have taken into consideration that i did come here on their opening night. And yes, i have been to the one in NYC once before.With that being said, my experience was somewhat bitter sweet. We started on a positive note, and $140 later(w/1 drink), ended with some Julias Empanadas to fill that void. I was pleased at the fact that my party of 3 didnt have to wait for a table, and the staffs were friendly. As far as food, the highlight of the night were the Razor clams... all 4 of them. Thats it! they were 4 clams in one order, which works out to $3/clam. I understand that this is a novelty seasonal item, but when they are available, Estadio on 14th offer an order of 6 for less $. The grilled baby octopus came with a tossed salad of sort that came with 3 or 4 pieces of grilled calamari scattered around the salad itself. This left me heart broken bc I had expected so much more. A few nights prior, at Estadio, i had the grilled calamari there, and it came with a whole plates full of calamari that was made to perfection. They technically didnt need to wash the plate after i was done with it. We then had the blistered Shishito peppers that left us wanting more... literally! There were maybe a dozen peppers total in one order, and although it was made well, I expected more of them. At Estadio, they give you at least 50% more peppers for a dollar less, which brings me to a conclusion that Estadio is a better tapas restaurant for me. We had several other dishes that i dont care to bring up, bc they were also quite forgettable. This place earned a 3rd star on my review because they had razor clams. These things are hard to find in this area, and it is always nice to find them randomly.Aside from opening nights kinks, our friendly waitress made things smoother with her upbeat energy. The place was decorated quite nicely with the layout more spacious and comfortable than Estadio. The music was appropriate, and not too loud. I liked Boqueria in NYC when i first went there, and i still do want to like it here in DC. They just need to learn to adjust accordingly. There arent that many tapas bars in the area, so competition is scarce at the time being. Boqueria needs to either lower their prices, or up the serving size, and maybe think about expanding their menu selections. Also NY prices will not work in DC, so doing some research there might not be a bad idea. I wont be coming back anytime soon, but i may give it another shot down the road to check out the condition and see if things have changed for the better., Props to reviewer Casey N. for really nailing it. I took came in on the first night and also have been to the NYC version. I am giving feedback because I hope the owners of this location will take a few things into consideration. Our bill was also about $140 and we left hungry. The grilled squid plate was insulting. The flavor was good, but it was mostly a nest of greens. The cheese selection and jamon selection were great, but the price point for the bellota was high even for the quality. The dates were great. The salted cod fritters were way to salty. You gotta soak that fish longer. The server was very friendly and helpful. The music was so loud we could not hear each other. The playlist was all over the place. It started out well (Enanitos Verdes, Mana), but ended up cheesy by the end of the night. Petty I know, but my opinion. They could also use more Catalan dishes. Maybe some fideos and calcots. Maybe that will come in the future. I will give it another shot in a few months after the kinks are worked out., Went on opening night, yesterday. The place is very nicely designed with the focal point being the bar. Music was great (although it is a Spanish tap place the music was mostly Cuban -- my favorite). Beer selection was very limited but I was assured they will be getting more soon. The food was good, not great. A bit pricey. The menu also seemed a bit limited. Service was great., Had the chance to see the place before it officially opened- beautiful space, very tasty food, most notably the churros and the tempura, the bacon wrapped dates too. Can wait to work through the rest of the menu, particularly the hunter rice with quail. I thought the setup and atmosphere was really nice. Slick decor yet comfortable. Huge windows peering out over the street, a good spot to spend an evening and a good location to start or end one. Definitely a place to keep an eye on., After operating two amazing restaurants of the same name in New York City, Boqueria has come to DC! Boqueria has only been open for a few days (since Thursday 3/15) and I have already made a point to visit twice. The service was great. Everyone was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The location of the restaurant is convenient, located in the heart of Dupont. It has a large bar overlooking the Dupont scene, and a patio for outdoor seating. The way the tables are organized invites conversation and passing the delicious food and it also has a large back room for private events. If its location and service are not enough of a draw, then consider the really good stuff, the food! Ive sampled way too much Cojonudo (Fried Qual Eggs and Chorizo on toast....these are phenomenal) and Datiles con Beicon (dates wrapped with bacon). These two tapas alone will get me coming back for more. Boqueria is great for a group of people, but also provides an intimate setting for a date. This restaurant is sure to become one of DCs finest, make sure to check it out and work your way through their menu., So we went on opening night - it couldve been a total disaster, but it wasnt. However, I didnt walk out totally satisfied.If youre going to survive in DC as a tapas restaurant, youre going to need a HH. $6 Port City and DC Brau isnt gonna cut it for long. However, our waiter was great - he was obviously trying very hard and gave us lots of suggestions and always kept our water glasses filled.Food wise, the pan con tomate was good - the bread was delish - but it was entirely too salty. We got another order with our cheese plate, but I had to remind our waiter, who at first seemed confused and checked the menu to see if it was included. the cheeses were amazing - manchego, manchego rosemary, and idiazabal, but the portions were TINY. TINY. TINY. The cheese came along with about ten golden raisins, a couple olives, and maybe eight little pieces of raisin bread. For $15, this was ridiculous. HOWEVER, the mushroom flatbread was delicious.I dont think well return without the advent of weeknight specials, but it was a pretty good showing for an opening night. Minus the ridiculous amounts of salt!, I had a great girls night dinner here. Good music, bustling without being too loud (at about 2/3 full), and very upbeat, attentive staff. The pepper-infused margarita had a soft kick and wasnt too sweet. Six tapas and one drink apiece came to about $115 for three of us but left us all full (not an experience others seem to have had, but we picked some heavier items). We started with the basic salad, which was a great size to share, not overdressed, and very fresh. Bacon-wrapped dates and the mushroom flatbread were hands-down favorites--really rich and decadent. The spinach with chickpeas and raisins and the albondigas were also delicious, super flavorful without being too heavy. I was ambivalent about croquetas with beef and potato--they had fine taste and texture but werent anything special. Overall, Id recommend it for an upscale-casual dinner with a small group (most things seemed hard to share beyond three people) or a fun date., The service was great, food delicious and music fabulous. When we arrived, we were told that we were going to have a 20 - 35 minutes wait, which was fine. Then, when we sat down for dinner, although we didn have to wait longer than 30 minutes, our server gave us each a glass of what we had ordered at the bar as a thank you for waiting. The servers were all friendly. The cheese and meat platters were generous. The wine list is a bit expensive for D.C. as most bottles are $40.00 and up. But, all and all it was a great experience and I look forward to going back., I just came here with two of my girlfriends upon hearing that a new tapas place opened up in my neighborhood where penang used to be. Although it is somewhat pricey it is comparable to my other favorite tapas restaurants: Jaleo and Zaytinya. Although the menu is somewhat limited for a tapas place, we loved everything they put in front of us. We started with drinks and the Sangria is creative, delicious and appropriately boozy. The patatas bravas were a little spicy (in a very good way) and some of the best I have had. The mushroom flat-bread had a lot of interesting ingredients and flavors. We also got the croquetas which were yummy and the chef selection of cheeses which was nicely balanced.Our waiter was very attentive and courteous and it was all around a really great night out with my friends. I will definitely be making this a regular after work and dinner spot., A group of girlfriends and myself went out for dinner and drinks about a week post Boquerias opening. The individual who called to confirm my reservation was able to work with us on our timing (on his own accord!), and pushed our reservation 30 minutes even though open table showed no availability. The space is gorgeous. I had been to penang many times before, and the transformation Boqueria did with that space is amazing. The mussels could use some work- the broth was very watery/runny. The Espinacas a la Catalana was our least fav, as the spinach was pretty wimpy, but it was a large serving. The Pan con Tomate was a fav at the table, as was the Patatas Bravas. There was also another dish with crispy chips served under a fried egg and some sort of cream. We dont remember the name of the dish, but it is a must try. Once the egg broke on the chips, it had a great texture and the runny egg worked perfectly with the cream. White sangria was great. I believe they took into account the suggestions on HH and HH prices, as the sangria was all under HH prices (I think $5 a glass?) and there were about 4 tapas that were $4 during HH. HH lasted until 7pm. The AC broke/wasnt working mid way through our meal. We were definitely sweating but were pleasantly surprised when our waiter offered us a round of drinks due to the heat. Exactly what any restaurant should do when they have a problem like this. The Chef, Mark, came out and greeted us once we were served our desserts. He even provided us with a free lava cake like concoction with a birthday candle in it, in addition to the Churros con Chocolate we ordered. The cake was great, but even better were the churros-crispy on the outside and light on the inside and the exact amount of sweetness from the chocolate sauce to compliment. The Director of Operations (I believe, as I asked if was the manager and said no, but he was something else high up), provided us with a complimentary bottle of cava to thank us for choosing Boqueria for our birthday celebrations. Blown away by Boquerias customer service. I worked in the restaurant industry for 4 years and believe that Boquerias service/the way they handled their obstacles, was stellar. The server even let me charge my iphone at one of their outlets so it wouldnt die., OMG! Nice concept but awful performance when it comes to food expectations! Poor servers are trying to do their best with the little that they have..., My generous friends took me to Boqueria for my birthday celebration and celebrate we did! The decor is fantastic - very natural with warm lighting, light colors and an openness not found often in this area. Yes, the air conditioning was broken and it happened to be an unseasonably hot day, but management more than compensated for it by buying us a round of drinks.As for the comments regarding the price - you obviously did not go during happy hour. Sangrias (which are great!) are $5 and there is a limited tapas menu with selections for $4 each. I had the white sangria per our waiter recommendation and it was perfect. We shared at least 10 different tapas treats including a charcuterie platter and all were good. Most were even on the HH menu!Zack (sp?), the operations manager, is in town from the NY outpost and took time out of his day to not only visit with us but to pour complimentary prosecco to top off our celebration. They also brought dessert for my birthday - free of charge as well.It just opened so there are still some kinks to work out, but the wait staff is all very pleasant, everyone is accommodating and has a good time ensuring that you enjoy yourself as well. The tapas portions are large, 4 people paid at $35/pp (which isn bad the way we were drinking), and the staff was fantastic. The only downside were some of the hoity toity patrons that are typical DC, can enjoy themselves regardless of where they are and feel the need to analyze everyone, but you can find that anywhere in DC.Thank you for making my b-day great and for opening our new firm HH spot! A++++++++++++++, Amazing new spot in DC. Loved everything - the red sangria at HH, cheese & meat platters, lamb meatballs, shrimp, bread, wine and beer. We had it all and cant wait to go try it again. Special shout out to Julie and Zach!, I came here on opening night with a group of coworkers. This NYC transplant is located near the Farragut North Metro and it was packed! The decor was very modern and chic and the restaurant had a good amount of seating. We sat down with a group of about 20 who staggered in at different times so ordering was a bit of a nightmare. I was disappointed when I asked the waiter about happy hour specials to find out there was none. I work in international development and I dont make a lot of money so I wound up ordering the cheapest drink on the menu, a $6 Estrella beer. (I understand there is happy hour now though!). We tried some potato dish that was good as well. Most of the dishes are served tapas appetizer style and run about $5 - $15 a per plate. I would recommend ordering at least a few for a group of friends if you are hungry. Wine and sangria seemed to be the intended substances by the bar as the back wall contains a wine cooler and several versions of sangria are available.Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Boqueria. I never felt rushed by the waitstaff and they were attentive to our needs. It was a little pricey for me, but Id be willing to give it another shot. Settling a check for 20 people is a nightmare I hope I dont have to go through anytime soon..., This is just what the West End needs!! Boqueria is one of those places that when you walk in, you just feel the great energy. My wife and I came here on Friday with another couple for Happy Hour and had some very tasty, authentic Tapas. We arrived around 6 and the bar was hopping. Let me tell you, this place is gorgeous! As soon as you open the front door, you see a display of cheeses and meats that are being cut a la minute. A beautiful black slicer on one side of the bar and a leg of Jamon Iberico on the other side. I was able to get a taste of the pata negra from one of the chefs and he explained to me about the raising of these animals and why the meat is so unbelievably tasty. It is $32 an ounce, but if you are into the finer things in life, you won want to pass this up! We also ordered a few of the HH montados, Gambas, Baby Squid ala Plancha, Croquetas, Papas Bravas and Sauteed Mushrooms. Not one was less then great! The food comes out of the kitchen in waves and is perfectly timed. Not once did we feel rushed or did we feel like the food took too long. We all agreed on which dish was the hit and it was definitely the Gambas (Shrimp with garlic and Oil). The shrimp were perfectly cooked, the oil was full of flavor and the bread we used to dip in the oil was perfect! On to the drinks. We started off with a cherry Sangria which was delicious and then moved on wine. The Sangria was very refreshing and I totally can see myself enjoying a pitcher of this sitting outside on the patio when Boqueria opens that (hopefully sooner than later). The music is very cool with a variety of lounge, Spanish Pop, Rock and during this visit I even heard Hurricane by Bob Dylan which is one of my all time favorites. I definitely plan on making Boqueria a regular spot and can wait to go back. Thank you Boqueria for bringing a little bit of Spain to DC!!!, Went there last night as a going away dinner with coworkers. We had to wait 10-15 minutes between receiving plates. Most tapas places, youe overwhelmed with the amount of food on the table. When I asked if the kitchen was backed up or if something was wrong, I was told No, it fine. And that it. It didn speed up much after that.Once we got the food, it was delicious. Wait staff friendly (for the most part). Maybe the kitchen is just getting their act together., I really wanted to love this place, especially with so few good options right around the office in DuPont. Unfortunately the salad listed on their web site that I had been dying to try - the Ensalada de Pulpo (Salad of octopus, marinated potatoes, celeryfris39e, pickled eggplant, cherry tomatoes) isnt actually available in DC. I opted for the Ensalada de Hinojo y Gambas (shaved fennel, citrus, avocado, marinated shrimp), which was a mountain of limp fennel with a few slivers of avocado and grapefruit and some small overcooked shrimp. Maybe I got the wrong dish, but not worth a second try to find out., I arrived around 9:30 and the place was jumping! I found a spot at the bar and grabbed an Estrella. I scanned the menu and ordered the Bacalao cod fritters with citrus vinaigrette. Albondigas Lamb meatballs in tomato sauce with sheep milk cheese. Baby squid a la plancha with fris39e, tomato confit, crispy shallots and romesco sauce. Grilled Spanish Sardines with pickled cauliflower and arugula. Tortilla Espanola. All around great flavors! Best Spanish tortilla in the area! Keep up the great work!, We have walked by this place several times and signage for sangria and suckling pig were what drew us there on a Saturday night.We were disappointed on both counts.  Sangria had virtually no alcohol in it. We had a $34 pitcher and neither of us had any buzz. Suckling pig was sold out @ 8pm.The dishes we had were so-so. The best of the lot were beets, carrots and cheese - simple and tasty. The octopus was close second, points for being very fresh and perfectly roasted on a bed of garbanzo beans. We had been excited for the rabbit paella and this was a win on the rabbit - tender and not gamey, but the rice was under-cooked and too greasy.*The crowd inside the bar area was lively and if I were to come back, I would order wine + cheese or meats and skip the food. **note for those with a nut allergy: there are many many items on the menu I wanted to try but was steered away from due to having hazelnuts. Kudos to our waiter for knowing which dishes I should avoid, but odd that so many items had nuts., Great tapas and sangria. Forget Jaleo for good. Boqueria is absolutely delish! Try the serrano ham or lamb sandwiches, and the croquettes. The sandwiches are served with patatas bravas and fresh salad. Yummy!Service is a bit slow at lunch, but you can manage to get out in time., We had dinner with friends and we wanted some tapas, so we decided to try a new Spanish restaurant in DC.We had gambas al ajilo, patatas bravas, croquetas, tortilla, carne a la plancha and octopus. The croquetas, shrimp and carne a la plancha were really good.We also had sangria, it was good.And I also tasted some churros, they were crispy and very tasty.One of the waitresses was very nice and helpful, she had a good Portuguese.The other one was super pushy and a little rude. We explained her that we have to enjoy the tapas but she was super nervous about take our plates..., Yelpers, if you know me (or have read any of my original works of fiction available through my mail-order catalog) you know I like a good prison rape scene as much as the next guy... but, what Boqueria did to me (and my wallet) tonight went beyond Shawshank, and made what happened to Edward Norton in American History X look like an episode of Mr. Rodgers. To begin, Il admit this place occupies a sweet-ish corner location with a great view of a Wells Fargo ATM and a shitty knock-off Irish bar, and the wait staff was helpful, if a bit clueless - but that is where the positive remarks end and the aforementioned shower rape begins. In a town with more than a few tapas joints, I rank Boqueria offerings just slightly below those of its next door neighbor..... Chipotle. Oh, what that you say? Chipotle doesn do tapas? Well, neither does Boqueria. Actually, that comparison might not be completely fair to Chipotle. From over-heated and undersized cheese plates to soggy specials of the day that had clearly been under a heat lamp from time immemorial, my entire visit (sans the nice wait staff) was about as gratifying as playing with a bag of Richard Nixon nickname. The food was the living embodiment of Sloth from Goonies - without the awesome catch-phrase or pirate ship. And, instead of being entertained by the asian kid and his hilarious antics, I was repeatedly double-teamed by the ridiculously high prices and microscopic portions that were often too poorly prepared to even finish! Truth be told, I was expensing the entire meal and wasn internalizing a dime of this mess, but I still felt ripped off.Bottom line, as Justin C. said, I rather eat tapas from any of the other tapas offerings in the city - Chipotle included - than come back here and drop any of my own loot (or soap). So, thanks, Boqueria, for giving me a reason to write a one star review! Hooray!, Went to Boqueria for the first time this Friday night. They didnt have a reservation until 9, but I did call day of. The sangria was delicious and gave my friends and I a chance to catch up (of course we arrived early to see if we could snag a table pre-reservation, but alas, no luck). The food was great! The bacon wrapped dates were a hit as was the gambas al ajilo- which comes with a side of yummy crusty bread- bonus!, what a spectacular experience! and i do mean experience. our server, Irene, was absolutely fantastic. I literally wanted every single thing she described so passionately. We ended up getting 5 dishes to share and all were absolutely delicious (the spinach i could eat every single day) and had delicious margaritas. while i will admit, the food ended up coming out a bit slow, we were in no hurry and the slow pace made it even more enjoyable to savor each dish. but it really was Irene and the entire staff who made the night. i HIGHLY recommend Boqueria for a fun, lively yet relaxing night out!, The food and wine list were very good, but the service leaves a lot to be desired. I practically had to break out air traffic controller moves to get the bartenders attention (about 8 other people were sitting or standing near the bar) and once I did order a glass of wine, he forgot to give me change - and I used a large bill so its not like he should have thought I was over tipping, even if he did warrant a generous tip!Moreover, I didnt realize until the next morning that they never brought one of our dishes and yet we were charged for it. The food was good, but Im a bit weary of returning to this restaurant., Fantastic tapas place! Very spain open market feel.. Il def be back :), This is a very nice place, but something about the experience didn fully sell me on it. The setting is very pretty. The whole restaurant -- except for a decent-sized outdoor patio in the front -- is on the second level of its building, open to lots of natural light. The large main dining room wraps around an open kitchen and bar, which are both full of activity and energy by the staff. The d39cor is great -- modern bistro style maybe? (I know little about actual style names, but this is what it made me think of.) Light-toned wood covers the walls and floor; plush white cushions are on the benches at the tables, contrasting well with the dark leather on the comfortable (and high, as others have said) stools. The lamps hang from the ceiling in brass fixtures. It looked like at least two more dining rooms were located farther back in the building, up a few stairs.I thought the food was very good also. Although the menu relatively small, there were many interesting things to try. And the small plates were good sizes for 1-4 people to have a decent taste of each item brought. I wasn at all taken with the sangria though. The sangrias were unique (to me and to those I was with, at least) in that they were rum-, tequila-, or gin-based instead of wine- or cava-based. This in itself isn a bad thing, but they seemed watered-down, which wasn pleasant, and tasted more like cocktails than what we thought of as sangria. The very small amount of fruit didn help the cause.The wait staff was friendly and mostly efficient. However, there seemed to be a number of times when confusion reigned briefly between us and the staff or among the staff themselves.Overall, it was decent . . . I just wanted more based on the very pretty setting., Heard about this from a friend so had to check it out. Was very pleased with the whole experience. Sat outside on the patio, enjoyed the wine that our server helped select, and all but the patatas bravas were excellent. We had the fried quail eggs, wrapped dates, shrimp and lamb meatballs were all delicious and satisfying. I would definitely recommend this place for a nice night out with friends., Went for there tonight for red Sangria (one pitcher, $34) and tapas. Absolutely love every single dish we ordered - spanish omelette, ham and mushroom croquetas, beef meatballs. Will definitely be back soon for their Paella! Place was packed with music in the background. Will try to hit happy hour next time., Went last night (June 23, 2012) for a light dinner here with my significant other. We enjoyed the food very much, but the hostess was not so kind. We were placed in a table outside that was leaning on one side due to the terrain and the plates were sliding. It felt like Titanic for a moment. My theory in life is that if you have an attitude, dont work in a place where people are willing to splurge because the place is not cheap considering the theme of the food. We may be young, but we are fortunate enough to make a good living and are also willing to enjoy and splurge when it comes to food. We dont cut corners. So the hostess kind of killed the mood. We get better service at the likes of Chipotle so the expectation in these types o restaurant is a bit high :). Not sure if we will be back again. We will stick to Taberna when it comes to this kind of cuisine. Thank you!, My first visit to Boqueria was years ago at one of their locations in New York and I am thrilled that theres one in DC now!Not only are their tapas delicious, prices are fairly reasonable. When I went to dinner with three friends, it came out to around $20 per person after tax and tip.Some recommendations for tapas:gambas al ajillo - shrimp in garlic, ask for extra bread to sop up the olive oil and garlic!paella de mariscos - minimum order of 2pintxos mournos/lamb skewerspimientos de padr33n/shishito peppers - 1 out of 7 of these peppers is really spicy, a fun game for the table to see if anyone is lucky enough to get one!They have daily specials for dinner, so definitely order from that menu too. On my first visit, we ordered a squid ink vermicelli paella, which was really interesting. I still prefer the traditional paella, but this is a must if you see it on the menu! The waitress said theyre taking it off the menu for now, but might bring it back. For brunch, there are some dishes that arent tapas-style, if youre craving a benedict with Serrano ham, suckling pig, etc.Theres also a nice patio for al fresco dining, although it may be a little noisy if youre sitting there around rush hour., Tapas and tapas inspired is quickly ending up on every street corner in DC. I not sure what the differentiators are between a number of aforementioned establishments. The food was middling and as others have noted, a bit over priced. The execution of tapas was there but again lacking something to add some flair to the DC tapas scene. Estadio has better food and execution.The service was Spanish paced, I not sure if this is what they were going for but it was god awful on a mid-week night. 15 min for water and another 15 min for cocktail orders to be taken. Waiter quipped DC finest when we ordered tap water... I don need jokes, just good food and good service. I know I can find it elsewhere., Fantastic service. Great outdoor dining and trendy bar. Reasonable wine list and very yummy food. Went with three friends and we all deemed it to be as good if not better than their NYC locations and one of our top,5 in DC, My friends and I went to Boqueria for happy hour a few weeks ago. The bartenders took at least 10-15 minutes to get you a drink. Not to mention the a/c by the bar was broken on the hottest day in Spring. The bar area is very limited so you are playing musical chairs w/ the servers delivering food to tables. On the bright side, the food was good. It was overall not a fun experience., Pros: central location, cool looking menu, great service (it is so hard to find great service). Cons: expensive, some of the dishes were not cooked correctly and the ones that were frankly did not taste that good or even exceptional for the price. Take your dinero to Estadio or even Jaleo., I have been going to this place for years, only at thier original location in NYC (19th between 5th and 6th), and when I found out they were opening in DC...I WAS SO EXCITED.Boqueria was one of my staple spots in NYC. You knew the food was going to be good, atmosphere fun/loud but still intimate, and you general knew what the bill was going to be. Boqueria DC delivered and I might add we got in on their grand opening night, which I know can be shoot or miss. This particular time my dining guests were my g/f, my work wife, and her b/f. Since it was their first time and I was the veteran they asked that I lead the charge on our order. Boqueria DC did not let me down. My consistent favorites are the dates, garlic shrimp, croquettes, cojonudo, and the morunos with a pitcher of the white sangria. All were as expected and the manager even came over to apologize for some kitchen hiccups that slowed down our food delivery but we were having such a good time I dont think anyone noticed. I was glad to see that the service was paying attention to everything.Overall, everyone was having fun, the servers were nice and welcoming, and the food and drink was on par. This has again become one of my dinner out staples!, Loved this place. My friends and I watched the EuroCup final here and had a great time with delicious food. Other perks: friendly bartenders, the bartender that mistakenly put in an extra order of the Tortijo and gave it to us for free, the windows, the complimentary post-game sangria, and the food was delicious. I ate wayyyy to many patatas bravas. However I will be going back for more. I would definitely come back here for a happy hour or weekend brunch. Ole!, Boqueria is amazing. I went there twice in the past week. The drinks are great. The cocktail with Kaz soda, fresh pressed lemon, and vodka was refreshing. I especially like the spicy Patron Margarita, with its red pepper flake goodness and just the right amount of salt and heat. The service is excellent-- enthusiastic, friendly, knowledgeable, and not intrusive. The food is special and delicious. The bread spread with fresh tomatoes and sprinkled with salt has fresh clean flavors and is simple and tasty. If the crab ceviche salad is available as a special, try it. Who knew that sorbet belongs on top of chunks of crab? Great also are the croquettas (any variety), baby squid salad, gambas al ajillo-- shrimps (salty, garlicky goodness). My personal favorite is the bruscetta with arugula, chorizo, and a fried quail egg, a perfect bite. The food here is spot on and authentic. It is at least as good as Estadio was, once upon a time. It not cheap, but I don believe it over the top expensive (Shawshank?) as another reviewer; it basically on par cost wise for the District dining scene.Truly authentic Spanish flavors, without the plane ticket., Ive been here 3 times and have never had a dull moment. The ambiance is fantastic and the place is always lively. I love the booth seating against the wall. Great selection of drinks including spanish reds and sangria. Everything Ive tasted here are fabulous but a few of my favorites are the patatas bravas, gambas in oil, and bacon covered dates. Pricepoint is indeed higher than many tapas places around but its so worth it., This was my first visit to Boqueria. I found the decor pleasing and restful after a hard day at work. However, the service was a bit too fast, and the sangria a bit weak. The tapas were excellent and priced in a way that its easy to combine small plates without spending way too much. The Bu31uelos de Bacalao and the dolce de leche crema with peaches and yogurt ice cream were well worth my visit., While DC is certainly not short on Tapas style restaurants, I felt there was something refreshing about Boqueria. Maybe it was the beautiful modern interior, or maybe it was the lack of pretension that usually accompanies those type of places.Everything on the menu sounded drool worthy. Shared the Seafood Paella with a couple friends. We all agreed it was delicious. Even our Spanish friend. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their plates as well.Their Sangaria however was the biggest disappointment which is the reason for the detracted star. For a steep $34/ pitcher, there was not a hint of alcohol in there. On the other hand, they make a pretty mean Cortado espresso.Like how they have their kitchen openly displayed on their storefront. My friends and I probably spent a good 5 minutes drooling over the selection of cheese and charcuterie nestled behind the window., There was 4 of us that came here for dinner, mid-week. I got a reservation just in case- wasnt sure how crowded it was. Didnt really need it during the week, but maybe on Thurs/Fri/Sat it could be beneficial. Our whole party wasnt here, but they let us sit. Overall, the meal was great- everything that came out was very tasty. Our favorites were: dates and bacon, sheeps milk plate, and some of the daily specials. The only negative thing was the initial service- took a while to order a drink and then to get one (probably close to 10 minutes overall, when it wasnt too busy). Otherwise, the rest of the evening was great. Well definitely be back- great choice of wines, tasty sangria, and great atmosphere. The decorations/atmosphere was fantastic- fairly light, tables spaced out well and great food., A friendly wait staff and healthy wine pours combine to make this a nice post-work gathering place. Remember that Spanish wines are still Old World, so don expect the fruitiness of Argentinian or Chilean wines (or Californian, for that matter). The food here might not satisfy purists at Santceloni in Madrid but for DC, it worth the trip., This is one of, if not the best, tapas place in the DC area, Id say. Ive been to La Tasca, Oyamel, Jaleo, and Evo Bistro (McLean), and this ranks above all those. Ive never been to Spain, so Im not going to vouch for any Authenticity. Everything we got at Boqueria was excellent except for this one rice dish which appeared burnt -- the only reason Im not giving them 5 stars. In spite of that exception, I heartily recommend Boqueria -- the traditional dishes were expertly prepared with terrific ingredients and balanced flavors. The non-traditional dishes felt right at home with the rest of the menu, were interesting without screaming novelty, and seemed to focus on seasonal, choice ingredients. Even simple things like the olives were absolutely terrific.We went on a Saturday night, early in the evening. It did get quite crowded and loud as night fell, but we were out the door when things started getting frenetic. The space is excellent, with a modern, but warm interior. I was not crazy about eating on the high stools, but I didnt think about it during the meal. There is lots of glass with a pretty decent street view. The waitstaff was attentive, but relaxed and friendly. We spent quite a bit, but it was a first-class meal. I was thrilled with the lamb meatballs and lamb skewers, but the most memorable dish was probably the tomatoes on toast. It sounds strange that something so simple would be so amazing, but it really was perfection and is the one thing I recommend not missing., This is one of my favorite spots in Washington DC! The pink grapefruit sangria is awesome and definitely order the Patas Bravas and the shrimp dish. This is tapas style dining, so you can try a bunch of different dishes. For dessert, go for the churros with chocolate. Yum! Boqueria is a little pricey but does not disappoint. The outdoor patio is amazing for late summer nights., Totally awesome! Everything was delicious. I recommend the squid-ink paella..., They definitely have some service issues and my night started out poorly -- waitress was kinda clueless and rushing/interrupting us from the second we sat down. And they were out of our preferred sangria at 8 PM Saturday night (and it wasnt that crowded!). But what started out poorly ended up excellent. I warmed to the waitress and she had some great recommendations (and she was very nice and trying hard). The food was fantastic.. Lamb skewers were out-of-this-world good. Great dates wrapped in bacon. Great shrimp, great everything. A little pricey? Yes. Service a little mixed? Yes. Will I be back? Regularly. Easily the best tapas place in DC., Great service, wonderful food. My favorite is the meat and cheese tablas served with a variety of bread with tomato, raison bread, olives, grapes., We ordered literally everything on the tapas menu and it all tasted basically the same. For the prices, Id expect the base seasonings and flavors to vary from dish to dish. The service was friendly, but nothing extraordinary, and the server managed to screw up on most of our orders. Not worth the hassle in parking and the cost., I had a great experience at Boqueria and will definitely go back.The ambiance was perfect for a relaxing Saturday night. We were told the wait would be 30 minutes, but the hostess steered us toward a high-top booth near the front and we got settled right away.The decor and service were lovely. When one of our orders was delayed, the hostess and server apologized profusely and brought us another tapas on the house.The food was good, but nothing exceptional. Our favorites were the few unusual tapas, like the ostrich eggs and the cantaloupe., I rarely give 5 stars, but I was so surprised by this place. I had not heard of it and went there for a business lunch. I felt as if i was transported to a trendy restaurant in Spain. You wont think Spain when you walk in, but the menu reminded me of every cafe and restaurant in all the cities of Spain I have been in. The have the Serrano Ham out on the counter and great appetizers. I only had the croquettas (serrano ham and mushroom), Lamb meatballs and then a Serrano ham sandwich which came with a side salad and the Spanish potatoes. I love Spanish food and this is as good as it gets in the US! I cant wait to go to brunch. I wish they had better brunch drinks specials and this place would be home. It will be a special occaision for brunch since so many other places have such good drink specials. If the restaurant reads this -- you will get even more business if you give better brunch deals., This was recommended by a friend and were VERY happy we went.We went for a Friday happy hour. The bar was super busy, so we decided to go to the restaurant for dinner. The tapas were ALL good, except for one: the melon and ham tapa. However, that was even satisfying.Our server was very pleasant. Shes a good sales person; she convinced us to get the Beer Sangria. I know, I had to visualize it too.So it came and it really was just like it sounds, hence it was not good.However, the whole dinner was absolutely amazing! The ambiance, the server, the food, ALL wonderful! Parking was hard, just because where its located: 18th and M, but its well worth it. Well definitely be back!, cool atmospheredelicious foodok sangriathe only bad part was the price. and too many olives. i want to go again.ive been to bodega in gtown. i think bodegas happy hour is better., I went here with three of my co-workers.We also had the Patatas Bravas as an appetizer. They were tasty, with this sauce that had just a bit of a kick.I got to try the cold Chorizo sandwich my co-worker ordered. It was good. Everyone else ordered the Bocata Moruno (grilled lamb, salsa verde, pickled shallots on toasted Stirato bread). We were still talking about this sandwich when we got back to the office. It was ridiculously delicious., I was looking forward to trying Boqueria after reading all the wonderful reviews.Unfortunately there are better tapas places in the DC area. The food was good - but nothing spectacular - and certainly not for the price. Dishes that should have been warm to hot were served cold. The chef did not stagger the dishes well. The wine selection could be expanded but the Vi31a Alberdi Reserva tempranillo on their wine list was fantastic.But, the atmosphere is cool and the service was excellent. Maybe the place just needs some time to settle in., Pretty good! pretty amazing and unique selection of tapas. * cheese plate was good-had pickled garlic for the first time...amazing. The tomato paste bread was OK. * paella de mariscos (seafood paella) was awesome* the shrimp dish...that sauce was great for bread dipping-we asked for so much extra bread....like seriously the waiter just ended up bringing more bread automatically. * I dont eat pork, but the bombas were apparently amazing, as we ordered another round... * The tortilla espanola was very flavorful and the texture was interesting. * Their selection of wines was unique but delicious. They also have some fresh sangrias that look delicious.The atmosphere is definitely classy, and its on the pricier side, but the servers were very accommodating, made good recommendations, and were friendly overall. It wasnt too noisy in there, and I love love lovveee the menus with the map on the back :) Im all about that decor., Ive been here twice, both for lunch and both times it was delicious! The first time I shared the Sauteed Wild Muschrooms, Manchego Cheese and Thyme Tapas and then had Bikini de Tres Quesos Sandwich. The Mushrooms were delicious, and they had a little citrus flavor to them. The Sandwich was good too, and it also came with some patatas bravas and a side salad, make the mushrooms completely unnecessary. The second time I got the Ensalad de Alcachofas which had the the perfect amount of Goat Cheese and Artichoke ratio! Loved both main dishes!, we came here for lunch last fri, and it was pretty good. i shared the gambas, shishito peppers and sauteed spinach. everything was pretty good. if you are more hungry, you can also get a sandwich, which is what my husband got. sandwiches are large and come w/ salad and patatas bravas. we also got the choc torte for dessert, which was nice to share.
9|bourbon-steak-washington|I have long been a fan of hotel bars, not just when traveling for work but also when I simply want a well-made drink, a comfortable spot to relax and an opportunity to people watch in my own city. After some fruitless shopping (save a red velvet cupcake) in Georgetown yesterday afternoon, my favorite Washingtonian and I popped into the Four Seasons for a drink. We parked ourselves on a comfy couch near an expansive window and ordered drinks. As we waited for my Pumpkin Cream cocktail and his glass of wine he pointed my attention to the bar.What is the name of the star of 24? He asked.Having never seen the show, I considered this for a moment, paging my memory for an article I read.Jack Bauer? I replied.He nodded. Indeed, Jack Bauer was sitting at the bar cheering for the Colts who were playing the Patriots.Our drinks arrived with nuts and snack mix, a staple youl find in any good hotel bar. We munched, alternately watching the game and catching sideways glances of Kiefer Sutherland and his 24 crew, who, by the way, are currently filming episodes of the hit show in DC.WHAT TO EXPECT:Impeccable service, good selection of single malts, fine wine and well-crafted cocktails at commensurate prices. The Garden Terrace still has a bit of the stodgy air of hotel bars past but it is a great place for a respite after hoofing it around Georgetown.Characters in this hotel bar range from tightly wound society women in St John suits to families to young couples on holiday.And of course, the odd celebrity., 2 weeks in a row, brought the folks this time for the holiday and I have to say that the second week was even better than the first... Once again the service was impeccable (Josh is a true pro, trust every word) and the venue does nothing less than wow the guest. I branched out this week and ordered the special, a 10 ounce rib cape steak, generally what I would refer to as a butchers cut, this is by far one of the beefiest cut of the steak, melt in your mouth marbilization that creates such a beefy tender peice of meat that it is a brush with heaven. Once again the service is 5 star, make that 6 star, they anticipate every move and are there to provide not only what youd like but perfect recommendations that you would have never thought to order. My fellow diners had the lobster pot pie, a wonderful meal, served table side, and prepared so well you would have thought it was prepped in a kitchens sole purpose was to make this dish look spectacular... The somolier (Max who has a gift) once again wowed us with a fantastic recommendation and this item was such a fantastic value that we had to order a few bottles. Bourbon has once again exceeded my expectations and surpassed any experience I have had at a DC venue. 5 stars, time after time, I cant wait, I hear third time is a charm., It was my birthday and as a surprise my husband brought me here. Ie been to Michael Mina Seablue in Atlantic City several times and love the food and environment. This was no different in quality and exceeded my expectations for a celebratory birthday dinner.The restaurant is located in the Four Seasons and its interior is as rich as one would expect. It has a graceful modern wood design with a light smell of wood (smoke or cedar?) hinting of Mina grilled meats and fish. The service from start to finish was attentive and friendly while respectful and helpful, and never overbearing. Light nearly inaudible music played in the background; a mix -Pink Floyd, Roxy Music, an odd but pleasant variety actually- that worked.Mina has total concept restaurants. As such, his drink menu is presented as important as the wine and food menus. (It begins with ...our beverage program parallels the philosophy of the menu - a modern twist on the classic american steakhouse.) This clues you in to the fact that youe not just having a meal here.For cocktails we ordered saltwater martinis. They were exceptional Chopin vodka martinis with a slight salty taste, served with two olives: one green and the other dark.While we were waiting for our drinks, the server brought a trio of fries and dipping sauces which were really very good, followed by four warm enjoined truffle rolls which were truly amazing. They were slightly sticky and buttery. Mmmmm.For our meals: I tended toward the seafood side of Michael Mina personality which is well represented on the menu. My husband leaned more toward the steakhouse side. I ordered Jonah Crab Beignets followed by grilled Big Eyed Tuna along with a side to share of Leaks Vinaigrette. Dan ordered Kobe Beef Tartare, a 14 oz New York Strip (dry aged) along with grilled Fois Grais as an accompaniment. We each shared with the other so we had a taste of all.The food was exceptionally prepared and flavorful. The beignets were tender light dough puffs around light crab served with a slightly sweet sour aioli that was a perfect complement. The steak tartar was seasoned exactly right not to overpower the fresh taste of the raw beef. My tuna was precisely prepared with a gentle taste of lemon which accented the subtle taste of truly fresh tuna which has been grilled over a wood fire. Dan steak burst with a smoky, meaty flavor and his Foie Gras was sweet and rare and simply melted in the mouth. The Leeks Vinaigrette was a highlight - a bright, lemony taste of subtle leaks with breadcrumbs - something Il try to imitate in the kitchen one day. For all of this, Dan picked an Olivier Leflame Meursault from Burgundy, a white wine with a complex and rich enough flavor to accompany the meat which is subtle and light enough (with a very nice fruity finish) to accent the seafood. A perfect choice.While stuffed, I had room enough for a bit of dessert. It was hard to choose among so many really interesting sounding flavors. I settled on, and we shared, the Passion Fruit Panna Cotta which drew an excellent choice when I ordered it. It truly was. Fruity, lemony, fresh and light. It rested easily on my stomach full of food and I was still able to walk out of the room afterward.Unless youe wealthy or have generous friends this isn an everyday or even once in a while place. It is, however, a very special occasion restaurant or one to come to when you have some money to burn on a really exceptional meal. (In my case it made getting a year older worth it.) Michael Mina is the latest of the celebrity chefs to come to DC and he is, in my mind, among those at the top of the list in knowing how to do exceptional, interesting (not weird) things with food and drink to create a truly enjoyable and memorable experience., Bourbon steak is a good restaurant, and runs a close second to BLT for me (the popovers keep me going back to BLT). I love the dim lighting, amber glow of candles, and the clubby and intimate atmosphere (yet energetic, too) of Bourbon steak. The service is impeccable, and definitely beats BLT on that front. My steak was perfectly cooked, my crab beignet appetizer was awesome, and my butterscotch pot de creme was yummy. I guess the only 2 reasons this place is not my #1 are a) the popovers at BLT, and 2) the lack of accompanying sauces to the steaks. But, its a great night out-just go!, My first Yelp review. Yay for me!I took my husband here for his birthday last week...love love love!! I canceled reservations at Black Salt and chose here instead and boy oh boy am I glad I did.First of all, the service was excellent. The entire staff (hosts, valets, busers, servers) was warm and totally unpretentious. What a relief. Once we were seated, we noticed an envelope addressed to my husband laying on a plate in the middle of the table. It was a note from the manager thanking him for choosing Bourbon Steak to celebrate his birthday. Such a thoughtful and nice touch. The menu was all recognizable and the food, while basic, was all prepared exceptionally well.The run down: We decided against an appetizer after filling up on the duck fat fries, (saving room for dessert!) and ordered two sides to share-the brusell sprouts with green apples and bacon and the black truffle macaroni and cheese. Both extremely yummy! I actually surprised myself by enjoying the brussel sprouts just a tad bit more. Hubby had the filet for his meal and I had the NY strip...mine was prepared perfectly and although he ordered his medium rare as well, his came out medium. But he enjoyed it just the same. Both steaks well seasoned and I agree with the melt in your mouth assessment. Delicious.We each ordered a drink with our meal. I chose a red wine blend which I really enjoyed and his favorite drink is a mojito..and, although it was January, that what the birthday boy wanted. He said it was good, but not the best he ever had.Immediately after we ordered came the black truffle buttered rolls in a cast iron skillet. OHMYGOD! They were perfectly seasoned and the best rolls I have ever eaten. I so glad they didn bring more though; otherwise I wouldn have been able to eat my meal!We had the Bitter Chocolate Cake for dessert...good, not excellent. But the presentation was what made it the highlight of the evening. The plate was decorated to look a like a mossy garden with the cake in the center and Happy Birthday (hubby name) written out in chocolate. Such a beautiful piece of work, I felt a little bad about eating it. ;)All in all, a great way to spend two and a half hours. Lovely meal, great atmosphere, exceptional service. A memorable experience...I will be talking about those rolls for years! Hopefully I get back there before then...all you yelpers should jump at the chance to go!, In a word, amazing. Bourbon Steak offered one of the finest dining experiences ever. It all begins with the assortment of duck fat fries with an assortment of dipping sauces which are simply delectable. Following the fries are the truffle butter rolls which are even better than the fries, which leads into the appetizer (if ordered) or main course. The root vegetable soup was excellent, I normally dont like cooked carrots but in this case I had to make an exception. I followed with the roasted duck served perfectly medium. The duck was exceptional as well as the seared foie gras side. My date had the chicken which was unbelievably tender. All courses added up equal a relatively heavy meal but save room for dessert and coffee... The date ordered the banana split which is very tasty; I should say so since I actually cannot stand bananas. I had the Michael Mina organic blend coffee served in a French press. Nothing really special in the coffee but a good way to bookend the meal. If you arrive early for your reservation do not hesitate to visit the bar. Im not sure where these folks learned to make drinks but I can guarantee that whatever you order will be the best youve ever tasted. I only have two drinks, a perfect Manhattan and scotch neat. The Manhattan was superb and they serve Johnnie Walker Blue so it goes without saying that the scotch was great as well. The wine and spirit list is fairly extensive so you will find something to please the palate.Bourbon Steak is worth the price and the time spent from aperitifs to dessert. The waitstaff is very helpful, not overbearing, and very attentive., The best part about my meal was the duck fat fries and the prime rib steak. Chef Mina, you need to teach me how to make this steak... I want to know exactly how many pounds of butter is used and how long its poached for before you throw it on the grill.The oysters were delicious. The ipswich clam was too bready... (I personally prefer the one from Kinkead) The able-side prepared steak tartare..... I was disappointed...While the concept of preparing the steak tartare right there in front of you is nice, I came to enjoy Chef meal, not some random guy/food runner explaining from left to right we have lemon peel, capers, salt, etc... etc.... If I wanted to see a show or someone preparing a dish in front of me, I would have gone to a Hibachi restaurant. And because the Chef effort/touch wasn there, each bite wasn consistent... some bites were too salty and some tasted too lemony. After 3 bites, I was really turned off. Had it been good, I wouldn complain about having it prepared at the table.The ribeye was absolutely delicious!!!! Desserts -- was the second best dessert I have tried in DC (first is at Adour)Oh!!!! The butter rolls...... UhhhhhMazing!While the steak was magnificent, the rest of the appetizers didn impress me at all -- minus one star. While our waitress was absolutely gorgeous and my friend couldn keep his eyes away from her, why do you insist we order a bottle of wine IGHT NOWwhen wee still working on our glasses of champagne? If two tables are seated on each ends, why must you seat another party of 4 right in the middle? The restaurant is practically empty... spread out!!! The restaurant gets very loud. Thus minus 1 star. Go try it!, First visit to a Mina restaurant. Ups: The restaurant decor is quite nice and fresh; an excellent addition to the style of the four seasons. The sommelier was attentive and on point with suggestions - among the better sommelier, certainly in DC. Wine list is terrific. Rib eye was perfectly prepared and flavorful. Black truffle mac n cheese was terrific. Downs: Despite all the staff rave reviews on yelp, the wife and I were disappointed (exception sommelier see above). Our waiter did not know the preparation differences of foie gras and was hesitant to clarify if both were Hudson V. The foie gras was missing an accompaniment (satsuma tangerine) and was under cooked. Our entrees were served before we finished the apps. The hosts were a bit pretentious (perhaps an anomaly based on other reviews Ie seen). Waiter was pleasant but too inexperienced. Generally: Think wel give it another go in a few months., Boyfriend: Sooo where does the birthday girl want to eat dinner tonight?Me: 2 Amy definitely. I am CRAAAAVING some pizza.Boyfriend to Hart text message:I will be home around 7:15.Put on the blue dress and be ready.now, why would one need a blue dress to go to 2 Amys? clearly, I could go to 2 Amy in my jeans!Arrive outside of the Four Seasons-Me: I don think this is 2 Amys....So, my birthday is my ABSOLUTE favorite day of the year...scratch that month. I think February is just awesome all around. I would have been happy with some pizza and peroni. Instead I in my snazzy blue dress and high heels walking into this swank restaurant confused.We walk to our table and on it, big present box and flowers...boyfriend NEVER buys me flowers.Clearly, he trying to impress me.We start off with cocktails... I wish I could remember, I just know they were strong and satisfying.Then a cold course, of oysters and lobster with a lemon-butter (yum).THE DUCK FAT FRIES ARE HEAVEN ON EARTH! Three types of fries, one sprinkled in white cheddar with their barbeque sauce, one sprinkled with herbs and a sour cream sauce (think they were aiming for sour cream and onion? either way delish!), and I cannot remember the third but it came with pickled ketchup. I swear my meal could have ended there..... but it didn.Out come the buttery rolls with black truffle sprinkled on them (orgasmic).We also got compliments of the chef, geoduck with poached shrimp...first geoduck experience...it was pretty tasty! I ordered for my entree the filet mignon, while boyfriend ordered the duck...both really great. I also ordered what seemed to be a deep fried bake potato. It was so buttery and delicious already, that I lost my patience for the added toppings included. The meal was great, the duck was fabulous and the steak was incredibly juicy!Now, a birthday isn complete without a dessert!I ordered the pot-de-creme with pumpin cake and pepitas drizzled with Macallan 18 butterscoth. No words could describe my love of this dessert. I couldn stop eating. From start to finish the service was great and not overbearing. Boyfriend was fabulous for surprising me! I definitely give this place 4.5 stars, but because of the occasion and the staff, I have to give it a 5!p.s. I am salivating at the thought of those duck fat fries. mmmmmmmmmm, Oh my Lord, how could I have forgotten to review Bourbon Steak?! Michael Mina is probably my favorite restaurant in San Francisco. There have been a few slips, but Mina is generally on his game in a way most celebrity chefs are not. I moved to DC a month ago, I read Mina had just opened a restaurant at the Four Seasons, I made reservations immediately.When you arrive you are greeted with a trio of duck-fat fries and dipping sauces, which is great because you can be in denial and be like, I would have never ordered fries but since theye here I might as well eat them. I mean, there are starving children around the world and it would just be ungrateful to let them go to waste.Second complementary surprise: truffle butter rolls that are like savory mini cinnabons on buttery-goodness overload. They just scream, And you thought nothing could be worse for you than those fries you just wolfed down! hahahaha! Too bad, must eat them, starving children would want it that way.The food itself (the stuff on the menu) is typical Mina excellence. The tuna tartare was slightly off from his normal pristine preparation; it tasted like it needed acid and maybe a little more heat. It forgivable, however, since it is still the best tuna tartare in the country.My boyfriend had a steak and baked potato, which was sensational. Sublime. But really, I am sick of talking about the food. I love Mina food and all, but I am totally leaving out the best part....OPRAH! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, there sitting approximately 15 feet away and facing me directly was Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, and a small entourage!So I have a slight obsession with Oprah and the honest truth is that I really couldn even talk at dinner. I may be lying about what I ate. I don know. Can remember. I in an Oprah-encounter induced daze brought on by her Jesus-like aura. And no- she wasn 700 lbs and scarfing down the tablecloth. She looked beautiful.Bourbon Steak: 5 starsOprah: a zillion stars, I went to Bourbon Steak on New Years Day with my best friend to ring in the New Year in style and I was not disappointed in anyway. When I first arrived at the Four Season Hotel I was greated and shown to the restaurant where my coat was taken and checked for me. I was slightly early for the reservation so I took a seat in the bar and waited for my friend to arrive. The bar alone is a sight to be seen and comes complete with comfy lounge seating and the perfect amount of light. The cocktail list was very impressive and spanned over 15 pages. They offer almost every type of liquor imaginable and the bartender is a master at mixing and muddling. My first drink was a Vesper those of you who are James Bond fans will know what this is (The drink Bond creates in Casino Royale and names it after his female partner). It is the perfect mix of Stoli 100, Bombay Sapphire, and Lillet Blanc. The drink was amazing and it was the first bar I had been to who offered it. They easily transfered the bar tab to our table as we were seated.The dining room is done in elaborate style and the decor screams classy steak house. I was very impressed with the attention to detail that is sometimes overlooked in steakhouses. Upon receiving the menu I was shocked at the amount of entrees they had that did not involve steak. I would say this is the perfect place to go if somebody in your group does not eat steak. Despite these options I clearly went for the Boneless Rib Eye (throwing calorie count to the wind) and an amazing tuna tartar for an appetizer. The appetizers arrived and they made my tartar at the table getting my input about how much of each ingredient I wanted included in the mix. It turned out to be absolutely perfect. They then brought us complimentary fries with 3 different types of sauces, all the types of fries were hand made and delicious. The main courses arrived in perfect union being placed on the table at the same time and the side all accompanying them. We got the Truffle Mac and Cheese and creamed spinach, both were done perfectly and served in individual mini-pots right off the stove top. I also got a second drink with dinner, a Manhattan made with Noah Mill small batch bourbon. I had never had Noah Mill before but it was of course on their list and I gave it a try and was not disappointed. It was one of the best Manhattan I had ever had. Finally came dessert and I had the Macallan 18 pot, and it was the perfect way to end such a decadent meal. I enjoyed even min of this amazing meal and I would happily go back in the future. I put this right with BLT as the best steak house in DC, but it is so much more than just a steak house. I would give this place 6 stars if possible., Immediately the best modern steakhouse in DC - tied w/ BLT Steak. Charlie Palmers should be closed, boarded up and sent on a boat to Baltimore before being shipped off to a 3rd world country because it has no place in the city/country/continent now that Bourbon Steak has arrived. I purposely waited to write this review until I had a chance to eat dinner, lunch and hang for some bar scene time, and Ie come away overly impressed with each experience. The redesign of the Four Seasons is great - very NYC feel.For lunch, order the burger. Best one in town. It comes w/ the duck butter fries and pickle ketchup, so if you like salt lick more than horses like I do, you won be disappointed. I didn even feel full after eating this and going back to the office for work - which you can say after eating a lot of $19 burgers in this town. Looking forward to checking out one of the special lunch salads on my next visit. For dinner, I took my girlfriend here for her birthday on a Thursday night. 830 pm reservation a week after they opened. We had one of those great dinners that if you eat out as much as I do, you feel like you never get where everything goes right...over the top service from beginning to end, the place was packed but we got seated right away, incredible apps, super helpful sommelier (hat tip for recommending a spanish red (x2) that we wanted to pair w/ our steaks that was not overly expensive), perfectly done steaks and not enough room left for dessert. Summary - if you want to spend $200+ on a dinner in D.C., Bourbon Steak is the best bet for my money., Took the lady out to dinner on sunday night, what a surprise! choices are few for sun dining but bourbon really stepped up. The place had a great vibe (busy yet relaxed) and the cool music complimented the cool decor. We started off with cocktails which were fresh, imaginative and downright delicious. While we were enjoying them a selection of piping hot french fries with sauces were offered, my favorite being the onion fries with onion dip. the server recomended several appetizers and I took the plunge with an octopus special, simply grilled over oak with a brilliant herb sauce, fingerling potatoes and some very crisp fresh herbs. she ordered the hamachi sashimi which had jalepeno, fresh coconut and lime, so refreshing and the fish was pristine! They sent out these little buttery rolls out of the oven that were at once crispy, perfectly chewy, warm and savory, perfection. I chose to indulge and ordered the 16 oz boneless dry aged rib, did I mention it was listed as usda prime on the menu? I ordered mid rare and it arrived perfectly seared and juicy with that smoky aroma and taste of dry aged beef. it was AWESOME! (and worth the hefty price tag 59$). My girl ordered the scallops which were caremelized and served with squash and a airy foam that the server said was malted milk, very interesting and the sweetness of the scallops with the malted milk was really cool. We ordered the Chinese broccoli and mac n cheese sides which were really tasty. I typically order cheese and she is a chocoholic and we were both pleasantly surprised. My cheese plate was the most innovative presentation I have seen in the city, three cheeses and a whole garden of paper thin crispy vegetables, sauces, and pickles to accompany them, warm toast capped it off nicely. she had the obligatory molten chocolate cake which was also presented in an innovative fashion with a killer ice cream. We enjoyed a bottle off of the sommeliers selections page which was unexpectedly good and rounded out the evening perfectly. It is pricey but as long as the deliver the goods worth every penny. We will be Back!!!, Yes. Go to the bar at lunch. And have the fish and chips. Or the hamburger, the best in town, with the fries made in 1/2 duck fat 1/2 canola oil and the pickled ketchup and homemade pickle. And then the very subtle MACALLAN 18 BUTTERSCOTCH POT DE CR38ME pumpkin spice cake, pepitas, butterscotch caramel, even if that is not your thing. And then wash it down with a glass of the relatively inexpensive Paso a Paso Tempranillo. Expensive and worth it., Went for drinks the Monday of Inauguration (saw Denzel) and for dinner on a Friday. The bar scene is hot. Full of DC hot girls trying to work their way up the social food chain. The bartenders were not. Took 20 minutes to get a drink. It was just ridic. There were like 6 people behind the bar, but they could not get their shit together, which was really surprising. They seemed to spend more time polishing glasses than making drinks. The dining room is well designed, although the tables are long and you have to scream across them. The food was pretty great. The menu was intriguing, lots of options in addition to basic steaks and fish. I got the pork trio (loin, cheek, and belly) The belly was so amazing, but thank god they only give you a 1 inch cube because I could feel it coating my arteries. The service was very meh, hence the rating. Our server was often absent and was very obviously trying to get out of there. When I was in the bathroom and he dropped the dessert menus, he asked my friend if he could order for me. Tre tre tacky. Oh, check out the specialty drink list. Lots and lots of interesting options. Some of the flavor combos reminded us of Gibson., Service for type of restaurant: C- Food: on scale of 1 to 10 (10 being best)Duck Fat french fries: They are very good fries but not magnificent. 8Truffle Butter rolls: Not good for a roll but not bad : 5Lobster Appetizer : Best thing we had that night and in general set the meal over the top for us. 10Braised oxtail: A bit on the greasy side. Good if you enjoy wine braised flavor: 6 Porterhouse (we split this): Great. Cooked perfectly, good flavor, however not magnificent for the price. 8Desserts: Dissapointed. Banana Split - 4 (good but too expensive for deconstructed banana bread with some ganache ice cream)Mcallan 18 Butterscotch - This is NOT GOOD. It is bitter and tastes weird. I found this unplesant and totally not what i expected. Maybe this is a great dessert for the lover of savory foods. Meh - 2Coffee- Very good.Ambience - Super (saw CNN People having coffee there too. Wolf Blitzer and some other dude)Service: Ordered a second Long Island Ice Tea (never came). Ordered Bone Marrow as a side with the Steak- never arrived. Waited 10 min for server after we finished food. Had to ask bus boy for check, for dessert menu, for drink refill. Basically if this was a cheaper restaraunt i would rate it higher but paying what i paid and going to the Four Seasons and etc i have a certain expectation of service and food from this class of restaurant that this place did not deliver., Mmmm, Michael Mina, you done done it again. The sleek and modern space makes you feel like a celeb (unlike Amanda C, I didn get Oprah in my midst, but Il settle for Wolf Blitzer) and the food is tremendous. The duck-fat fries seemed to go over big (remember, I an American freak and am not into this classic comfort food), but were outdone in my book by the tremendous truffle butter rolls that make you mentally apologize to BLT popovers, because theye just been replaced as your fave steakhouse bread. I actually think the sides outdo the mains here, which is only to say that theye off the charts and the entrees are excellent. A rundown of what my table ofour had: Starters: 2 A+ red king crabs, an OK autumn vegetable salad to share (ratio of veggies to lettuce made me a little sad inside) and 2 outstanding tuna tartares. Entrees: 2 fillet mignons made mouths happy, the tuna was excellent and turns out, I like tilefish. Love that their fish is simply grilled/prepared here, as opposed to crusted/stuffed/drowning in unnecessaryness. Sides (again, the scene-stealers of the night): black truffle mac & cheese, wild rice with peas (we asked for our peas unbuttered, good move, Mom), golden beets with orange slices (best beets Ie ever had) and the magical mushrooms live up to their name. One side I side against: the Chinese broccoli. I don know why we ordered it, but it remained hard to explain upon tasting it. Dessert: banana split, which was a sweet twist on the classic dish. Deconstructed means more banana: LOVED it. I was considering a 5 star review until our waiter approached us asking if we would like anything else just as we started tucking in to the bananas. Upon saying no thank you, he placed our check (which was already in hand) on the table. I get that this place is stacked with reservations, but keep it classy, guys, wee barely been 90 minutes. Besides that odd ending, the service was fine and the food, as youe gathered, can be denied., Best steak Ive ever had. Strangely, however, Im not completely blown away. It wasnt anything I havent had before; it was just better. Not a ton, but enough to notice and in every possible way. Probably the best service in DC, but the hallmark of excellent service is how unnoticeable it is: Unobtrusive yet never left wanting. Very pretty restaurant - may be the best, but its not a no-brainer. Its a steak place, but its not uninventive like most. For example, I had lobster corn dogs. Unlike Central, however, this use of lobster was not gratuitous and wasteful. All told, this place is truly great - but whats perhaps more stunning is how understated its greatness is., Hubs dines here a lotHe says I will prize - true, word.Five stars as Yelp ratesWoohoo!

The space was absolutely beautiful and the hostesses were very accomodating. I requested a corner table and was seated in one despite running 15 minutes late (I, of course, did call to let them know - can help raining day in DC).The service was decent - not fabulous or mediocre. I thought the service was a bit slow, but I am not sure if they were trying to accomodate a business dinner by leaving us alone. I did, however, have to often flag down one of the servers for assistance.The sommelier that evening did not seem very knowledgable in wines. I know it definitely wasn the gentleman mentioned in previous reviews. When asked about some different wines, her response was, that wine is very good. Ummmm... can you get a bit more descriptive than that? I am sure the wines were placed on the wine list becuase they were good. So we first order a $260 bottle of Barolo (you will know why I am mentioning the price in a sec). It definitely needed to breathe a little but was served rather in haste.We were served the famed duck fat fries. They were good but not mind blowing as I had anticipated. Perhaps I was salivating too much while reading the reviews. The rolls were, however, phenomenal. I think it can definitely be the new crack. The rolls were so savory, buttery, and delicious.After what appeared to be 30 minutes of sitting around, we ordered our appetizers and entrees. I ordered the fluke sashimi followed by the New York Strip, medium rare. Fluke was light, refreshing, and tastefully done; the New York strip melted in my mouth. I did get a chance to get a bite of the sweetbreads appetizer - they were to die for!!! It was a cross between (the chef will definitely cringe at this) fried chicken and sweet breads. Yummi!!! Two of my favorite foods merged into one!!!As we finished the bottle, they asked if we would like to continue with the same bottle. I responded no and proceeded to choose a $90 domestic syrah. Wow... that when the level of service started dropping. A $90 is not the cheapest wine, especially in this economy, but there was a noticeable difference in service. Had the MaCallan 18 Pot de Creme to finish which was unremarkable along with a glass of Tokaji wine. Overall, it was a decent experience. I definitely do think that the most memorable part of the meal was the rolls, sweetbreads, and the New York Strip.
10|brasserie-beck-washington|I writing this with quite mixed feelings. Wel start with the good: the space is gorgeous! Crisp, clean lines; a windowed open kitchen; lots of nooks and crannies of dining spaces to create a more intimate feel. Then there is the food, which is phenomenal. We started with various salads. They were each delicious and beautifully presented. I had a shrimp, tomato, and avocado, and one of my guests had the tomato and goat cheese napoleon.Next came the entrees. We had a variety, from duck breast with pork belly to this delicious puff pastry thing (some french word I can remember) that had a tasty sausage and other goodness inside to...wel skip the last entree and move to the downsides.First the bar - theye going to get killed if they don speed it up. It seemed like an eternity before we got our first round of drinks while waiting for our table. But that pales in comparison to the effort it took to close our bar tab and move to a table. After 10 minutes of trying to pay the bill, I asked the maitre  if they would take care of it (we finally did get the check), and they very graciously did. Definitely a kink to be worked out.Brasserie Beck apparently does that obnoxious team service concept, where you have 2-3 people coming to your table to ask you the same thing every step along the way. I know people who love this. I not one of them. I more the guy who likes a professional server who can read the mood of the table (more importantly *my* mood) and deliver the desired service. This is really, really hard to do and a difficult standard to live up to (see my reviews of Sushi Taro and Acadiana), but it done regularly around our fair city. These kids at Brass Beck seemed like it was 1.) their first day on the job and 2.) their first day waiting tables. They stumbled across each other. They smothered then ignored us.And it gets worse. We placed the orders for our first and second courses, and there was quite a while before our first course came. Not a problem for us - we were enjoying the conversation and it wasn noticed until after the table was cleared for the second course. Waiting...waiting...then the big boss came up again and told one of us that they just ran out of their entree 5 minutes ago. This would be an understandable gaffe for a new restaurant had (and wee skipping the two other people who did the same jig at our table) our primary server not said, That just speaks to how popular they are. HOW IN THE HELL COULD A RESTAURANT THAT NOT OPEN YET HAVE THAT PROBLEM??? I smart, I forgiving, but don lie to me. That was part of the laundry list of service failures.I generously giving 3 stars to the restaurant because the food deserves all 5 stars. The beer and wine list deserve 5 stars. The room gets 4 stars only because the beautiful clocks (think old school train station) that adorn the space...didn show the same or the correct time. (Yeah, I impossible. But details matter, right?) The problem here from people on the inside is service, and unfortunately I have to agree. This problem is not unique to a new restaurant though, and I look forward to updating this review to reflect the improvements to the experience that I know Chef Robert Wiedmaier demands.All in all, Brasserie Beck is one of DC young hopefulls., I thought of starting this with love at first bite or something corny like that, but decided to spare yll. Because I only did a quick first visit, I withholding one star.In short, I love the space, the expansive beer list and the food menu full of choice that tempt me. I can wait to return for lentils with lamb sausage, duck confit, more of that incredible potato gratin with pork belly and pear tarte tatin. Il have another Bacchus (a Flemish red ale available on tap; I also recommend the similar but more tart Duchesse de Bourgogne available by the bottle). And maybe Il even check out the wines.Oh, and the $22 charcuterie plate, full of housemade cured meats, condiments and pate, is worth every penny.Service at the bar was pretty much what you expect for primetime (Friday night) just days after Brasserie Beck opened: a bit harried, but friendly and well-intentioned.In spite of greatly different styles, I have found myself comparing Brasserie Beck to still somewhat new Central. While the food quality is similarly high, prices are much gentler., As a huge fan of Marcels, I was happy to see another Weidmaier creation. I was impressed by the food and presentation as well as the space of the restaurant. I have to agree with Aaron about the bar service being slow - as molasses. The dining room service was better but needs a lot of room for improvement.On my first trip there, I was seated by the hostess at a very nice table in the middle of the dining room. My first shock was that all of the four menus we recieved were caked with dried sauce and other food stains. I looked around at my party nervously hoping that no one else at my table got a menu as bad as mine but someone finally spoke up and we ended up joking and comparing stains - trying to decipher what each stain was. The waiter came over to us and gave us the usual speil - he offered no information to us. In fact, I wasnt sure if he even knew the menu. I ordered my mixed drink and my friend ordered an iced tea. The iced tea comes bottled so watch your wallet and drink slowly. It surprised me that our appetizers arrived before our drinks did not to mention the fact that we were also the only ones in the restaurant at the time. On to food: I tried the mussels which are delectable and beautifully presented in a cast iron skillet. I was pleasantly surprised to see on the menu that the mussels are prepared in different sauces - I tried the apple and curry sauce and also the traditional white wine and garlic broth - my personal favorite. One word of advice: if you order the mussels, save the bread they give you because the mussels are not served with bread and the sauces are too good to give up. For lunch, I ordered the monkfish which was disappointingly bland. I was almost ashamed to ask for salt since there was no salt or pepper shakers on the table (which is par for the course in many restaurants nowadays.) However, when I returned the second time and ordered the skate, I just had to ask. The skate too, was underseasoned (in my taste). The salt is presented in a small dish with three compartments, each with a different kind of boutique salt. I would tell you what they were but the waiter failed to give me a description and just walked away.The sausage and lentils are wonderful as is the country pate and the very generous charcuterie plate. The french fries are okay but dont really live up to all the hype. I prefer McDonalds - BUT! the trio of mayonnaise dipping sauces was clever and a surprising treat to come with the fries. Definitely do a side of the brussel sprouts gratin! Its rich and cheesy and easily masks the flavor of the sprouts for those who dont normally enjoy them. The dinner chicken entree (waterzooi?) was rather unremarkable. The lamb shank looked fabulous but I was not able to get a bite in - my friend was already gnawing on the bone. In my opinion, the best way to go is just to get a variety of appetizers to share. I found that the apps were much tastier than the entrees and much more interesting. Ill be glad to return again and again despite the shaky service - plus, I cant forget that its new and still running on training wheels., First of all, best selection of beers on tap in Washington DC. If you like Belgian beers, this is the place -- the only place that can contend with Beck is the Burp Castle in NYC (cask ales from Belgium, served by monks -- though they arent real monks)....the have an amazing beer list by the bottle too. Amazing. Wine list is very nice as well -- and the mark up isnt too bad.The food was really quite good. The mussels and frites were not as good as Bistro du Coin....great salads and appetizers -- and all of the dishes were marked by wonderful, flavorful sauces........Pea soup with veal chuck meatballs -- different than any pea soup I have ever had -- very flavorful and comfortingLamb sausage with lentils -- amazing sauce and lentils -- the sausage was a bit mealyToasted garlic baguette with poached egg and fricassee of mushrooms -- deliciousService was friendly and attentive. Prices were very reasonable.Will return.I have returned to Brasserie -- I love their French onion soup, pork belly with rice and beans, Lamb shanks looked quite good......service was slow, apologetic, inferred that a round of drinks was on the house, but was on the bill., As a fan of Belgian food, we decided to check-out the newly opened Brasserie Beck on a Friday night. The wait was about 45 min. without reservations so we enjoyed some great beers at the bar (try the apple-flavored one) from the extensive menu and had a dozen west coast oysters which were very fresh. The bar area was a little chaotic and slow, but it was a busy Friday night. The lay-out of the restaurant is spacious but at the same time feels intimate with the separate seating areas. My only complaint is all the servers walking around frantically and almost running into us and the only bathrooms which are all the way on the other side of the restaurant by the bar. The house-cured salmon was delicious and a great appetizer to share. I had the mussels with curry and apple which was decent, perhaps not as good as bistro du coin, and came on an alarmingly large skillet like they didnt have time to put it in a pot. It was also a little gritty and I kept cracking me teeth on bits of sand. My boyfriend had the braised rabbit which was juicy and a little gamey but overall pretty good. We were stuffed afterwards, so no dessert, but definitely a great up-and-coming place that watch out for., After reading about this place in the Washington Post Magazine, my wife and I thought wed give it a try. The promise of 50 Belgian beers alone was enough to get me interested.When we arrived, we were met by very friendly staff, a gentleman, who I assume was a manager, and the hostess were both very cordial.We had a drink at the bar first. The bartender asked both of us what type of beer we liked and made spot-on recommendations to us both. If youre going and like wheat beers, order a Whittekerke, it was phenomenal.The charming, open dining room was very elegant, yet casual, and reminded me of a place you might find in one of the resort hotels on the Strip in Vegas. Our service was outstanding. Our waiter made great salad recommendations and gave us a detailed description of several of the entrees. My wife ordered the pork and I had the skate. Her pork was outstanding, and I RARELY eat pork. My skate was cooked perfectly and the sauce and accompanying spinach were very tasty, although I was not a big fan of the fish itself. I think this was a personal preference and did not reflect the quality of the dish.Overall, I would give the atmosphere and staff a 5 and the food a 4. If I could rate this a 4.5 I would, but Im rounding up, and giving it a 5. Give it a shot!, Now this place is a winner. Talk about a great variety of delicious beers. Unlike the Brickskeller, Beck actually has those wonderful beers you see on the menu. The bartenders are nice, helpful, and recommend great beers if youre a bit too overwhelmed. And they dont just recommend the most expensive thing on the menu, which is usually the easiest thing for them to do. I cant give this place 5 stars yet, though, as I went there solely for the brews and didnt taste any of the food. But the folks next to me ordered the mussels and oh mama did they look and smell good. As some people have pointed out in there reviews, it gets a little crowded. But if you get there on the early side (i.e. right after work), you can usually grab a spot to sit (because who doesnt want to sit after a long day of sitting at work?) pretty easily.The only problem with this place is that its a bit out of the way, at least with respect to the other places I frequent. But its close enough to most offices downtown and/or government offices that its a great place to catch after work. Check it out!, Man, I really wanted to like this place, but it just fell short in too many areas. Things I liked: -The truly fantastic beer list. Becks has the best and deepest selection of beers in DC, in terms of breadth and quality. I had an apple beer from Wisconsin that was one of the most delicious brews Ive ever had. -The delicious bread basket. I know that sounds funny, but I think a lot of establishments nowadays forget this is the first impression they give most people. The bread was piping hot and oh, so tasty. Be careful not to fill up on it.Things I didnt like:-Poor service. Our waitress hadnt learned how to serve and clear dishes properly, reaching across my face (!!!) several times to remove empty dishes. Her sleeve got in my food! When the cheese course we had ordered arrived, she just plunked it down and took off, with no explanation of what was on the plate. Finally, she presented the bill to the sole male member of our party, even though I had placed the reservation and had ordered our drinks. Nice. And then there was our water guy, who kept on checking our glasses every 10 minutes (I wish I was kidding). This was horribly annoying and intrusive. -Over-salted dishes: the famous fries were crisp but way too salty. Likewise the croque monsieur - its actual name is the croque sel. -Food temperature: I had the shallot-onion soup* and it was served at too high a temperature, masking the flavors. (It was also too salty.)-Portion size: I know people have differing opinions on this, but I think waiters should give their tables an idea of how large the portion sizes are when they place their order (i.e., ordering a cheese course and fries as appetizers is not a good idea when the each of the main entrees can easily feed two people). -No low-fat creamer option with your coffee. Apparently the chef has philosophical difficulties with the concept. *insert eye roll here*To sum things up, go for the beer, stick with the appetizers, and be prepared for waiters who dont know what theyre doing.(*Not the traditional onion soup I was expecting and a fact that should be noted on the menu.), Unbelievable restaurant! The rabbit is to die for. By far the best item on the menu. The Moules Frites are also excellent, and the beer list is unmatched. The fries are great, Hanger steak is only good not great. A great brasserie/bistro type restaurant. Strongly recommended, Based on a friend very strong positive review and the mix of positives and negatives on this site I was not quite sure what to expect last night when a friend and I walked into Brasserie Beck. All I can say is that when we left my friend and I agreed that we would be back very soon. We received great service (ask to be seated in Chip section!!!), the food was great, and when the moment of truth arrived we realized that we were going to spend less than usual on our regular nights out.I tried to make reservations online with Open Table but that service did not list anything available at our desired time. So I called the restaurant and after lots of ringing talked to a rather terse woman who took my reservation for slightly earlier than I had hoped and then informed me that reservations were only held for 15 minutes after the appointed time and that everyone in the party had to arrive before the party would be seated. I realize that these policies are not uncommon and really are a response to a trend where common courtesy is not observed by patrons, however, when they conveyed as a bit of a threat it is a bit off putting.So, of course, I was a bit concerned when my companion and I were both running about 20 minutes late for our early reservation. I was afraid that we were going to be relegated to one of the bar tables up front. However, there was no problem and we were seated immediately.So after a bit of apprehension the fun began. Our waiter, Chip, presented us with our menus, a beer list, and a wine list. We were a little overwhelmed. Everything looked so good! We were having difficulty deciding and Chip was a HUGE help! He did a great job listening to our preferences, recommending beers and appetizers, demonstrating the funky Belgian glassware that the beer is served in (my companion beer required a glass plus a wooden holder), and generally keeping an eye on us. He really helped make the meal fun and I will definitely request to be seated in his section when I return!The food was very tasty and plentiful. We shared two appetizers--a shrimp, avocado and heart of palm salad and the mushroom fricassee which were so good that we had to get more bread for all of the tasty sauces. I ordered the mussels and was presented with a cast iron skillet full of musseley goodness. My friend followed Chips recomendation and ordered the skate which was nicely breaded and fried. We decided that there were too many dessert options and defaulted to sharing a 3 cheese plate for our final course. Although the portions were a bit smaller than I expected it was just right to finish the meal.The damage for all of that food plus two rounds of Belgian beer (@ $8-10 per person per round) was just over $100. Of course, this did not include the generous tip for Chip either. But all in all, I felt like we received a very nice meal for less than I have paid for lesser food and service at other Washington establishments. I highly recommend Beck and will be back soon.So after such a glowing review you may be wondering about only four stars. I found myself wanting to give five and not including the other part of experience at the restaurant but then I realized that the other unpleasantness should be included too. The fifth star was removed for the less than welcoming reservation experience and a situation where it seems that the restaurant staff forgot that customers can see them!!! While I was waiting for my dinner companion I was standing near the entrance of the restaurant. A man and a woman came over and were standing by me and began having a very heated exchange, he began questioning her in a way that made me VERY uncomfortable. I thought I was witnessing a spat between a husband and wife so I moved away from the developing situation, in fact I continued my wait outside. I was very surprised to find the two people that had made me so uncomfortable at the host station--they were restaurant staff that were having an argument in front of customers! Maybe that was part of the French ambiance that they were trying to share with the customers but I really could have done without that unpleasantness at the beginning of my meal., The Good1.The Waiter was excellent, attentive, insightful, great recs2. The dessert was impeccable, pear tart 3. Bread basket was great4. Beer list and beers were terrificThe Bad1.Saltiness of food,-Salmon tasted like it was salt encrusted or the dispenser broke and they decided to serve it anyways2. Size of fry dipping sauces-Fry basket was big enough for four people, the dipping sauce was good for 5 fries3. Portions-soso, dont want or need huge portions, but some were too big and others were too small4. temperature of food-steak was served luke warm overall at bestAll in all I will not hurry back, it has potential, would definitely go for a drink, front bartenders seemed professional and attentive., Im a Belgian food and beer fan so I was excited to have yet another option in DC. Frankly, any place with a great Belgian beer selection is my kind of joint. I joined friends for lunch at Beck last week, hoping for another fun-filled meal of great beer, good frites, and creamy, buttery dishes. Sadly, for me and my party, we were disappointed. The beer was wonderful, the wine good, the service impeccable, but the food was plain. You heard me right. Plain. Franks lemon sauce fish was not even discernibly lemony. Sheilas salmon was just salmon. The experience went on and on like this. The frites were boring in their friedness. The dishes just didnt have a pop or zip or zing among them. And this was true for all four of us (I checked). So Ill go back and check the food, but my emphasis at Becks will be the beer., I have no complaints whatsoever about Becks! Each of the times Ive been there Ive had a great time and great food and even better beer! The steak tartare was great! I couldnt even finish it because it was so filling, but it was fantastic! The Croque-monsieur was equally tasty and the fries are tasty. As I mentioned, they have a great selection of Belgian beer, while other places in the city have bigger selections, Becks is almost exclusively imports and you cant go wrong there. Talk up the bartenders, they know what good, but if you are looking for a really tasty beer, check out the Scaldis - an amber ale, with caramel and fruit and a great finish., I made it back to BB. Luckily I live a hop, skip, jump, and a block and a half from it.I still gotta say: Daddy like! Had the oysters again. Went with a friend of mine and his fiance. She doesn usually eat/like oysters. We coaxed her in to trying them. Not a good idea. She loved them and started eating into the goodness.the Lamb shank was great. the Pork tenderloin was tasty. But what was the best part of the evening? The Belgian waffle for dessert. This evening was a caramelized peach/white grape waffle. I believe they do a special Belgian Waffle each week. So good.I too had the Bavik. great beer. My Friend had a Ciroc martin. (vodka made from grapes.) the first taste is a subtle sweet grape but finishes really smooth.Possibly the only knock i would have against this place is it loud. something about the acoustics in the building carry every sound in the bar area to the tables which sit on the perimeter of the restaurant.-------------------------------------------The food is good but can be pricey depending on what you order. The bartender was cool. Some of the waitresses were cute. But everyone was nice to me. ( Little playful banter between the waitress and I. ) The major selling point for me were the oysters. If you like west coast oysters, this place had the sweetest, creamiest, smoothest Oysters. 100% satisfied with them. Highly recommend., I went to Brasserie Beck last night to celebrate a friends birthday and had a good time and great food from a great waiter that provided okay service. We started with a drink or two from the bar and the selection of beer is excellent with choices running from about $6.50 to $150 for a beer (something for everyone). I had the Bravik which was light and not too strong; just what I was looking for at the time. The server in the bar did have trouble on a couple of occasions with serving the wrong beer to the wrong person or just the wrong beer all together, but problems were addressed quickly (however, we had one of the wrong beers show up on the check as well).Then we moved on to our table and were promptly greeted by our server. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu (with a few exceptions...read on) and offered up some great recommendations. I had the salad frisee and the steamed mussels prepared with curry and apple, both of which were very good choices. I also sampled from the people seated near me the brussel sprouts, steak tartare, 5 cheese sampler and lamb shank, all of which I would order on a return trip. Everything looked great and tasted even better.The major issue with the service during our dinner more affected our friend who is a vegetarian. She inquired whether or not the potato and leek soup contained meat. The waiter indicated that he would check with the kitchen and then never returned with an answer. When the appetizers were served, the soup was served to our friend and it ended up containing bacon. The soup was returned and she received the cheese sampler as a replacement (however, we ended up being charged for the soup). She also ordered the Tomato Napoleon which was served with a slice of prosciutto, which we just removed. The problem was well handled, but just beware if you happen to have an objection (religious or otherwise) to meat that you may want to double check your meal choices and ask a lot of questions.All in all, I would recommend Brasserie Beck as the food that I tried was excellent and the beer selection was outstanding. The only thing that kept this from being a 5 star experience was the few missteps with the service. I definitely plan on a return trip, if not only for the beer., We came here for dinner on a Saturday night with a 9:00pm reservation - the place was hopping (where did all these people come from??), even though the general downtown area was a ghost town. We had to wait in the bar area before they called us to the table - even that was crowded.My meal - a huge pan of mussels in curry & apple broth with a generous side of frites. Delicious and highly recommended. We also tried the Belgian waffle dessert, which came only with measured topping of some kind of berry and a spoonful of ice cream. Service - it took a while for us to get our food, but once the first course came out, the rest came out in good rhythm. Our waiter was consistenly pleasant the entire time. The only complaint I have is the cramped seating in the back (where they seated us at a table of 2 right next to a loud table of 4 and there was not enough distance between these two tables). If theres room, definitely request an space closer to the front. All in all a very enjoyable meal. I look forward to coming back with a larger group., Little pricey but a good lunch spot with great food and a one-of-a-kind beer selection. Seems like a good happy hour location.....to be continued., I love this place the food is GREAT, the portions are very generous and cook to perfection!!! Ive been here twice, once at the bar the second time sat at a table with a party of six.BAR: The bar is nice, it gets crowded, mostly cause you can eat there if you choose. They have like 50 different beers, although I dont drink beer my friends really enjoyed what they got and there seem to be one for each of there taste buds. The drawbacks are the bartenders they have a crappy attitude they act like if you ask for anything your putting them out of there way, dont bother asking a simply question they dont have time for it. They have the attitude that they were put back their only to serve drinks and nothing else, so if you order food they give you the look of hatred.HOST: I called to make reservations and the girl on the other end was VERY nice and answered all the questions I had without problems. When we arrived we got sat right away. (Side note: MAKE RESERVATIONS)SERVICE: The server we had knew the menu well and answered any questions we had, she was very nice and took care of the table. It wasnt outstanding, but then again this is DC and theres not really A GREAT server in this city.FOOD: The food is great, great portions, flavor, everything about the food is outstanding. Everything Ive tried has been great. A couple of recommendations: You have to get the mussels to start of with, just be careful if you get the ones in the garlic, you wont be making out with anyone all night but its worth the Sacrifice!! But no matter what you need to get for a starter the Roulade of Duck Confit Pomme Puree, not a big duck fan, but I cant get enough of this dish, it has such GREAT flavors. For the main course I seem to always go for Grilled Trout in a Lemon Caper Sauce, not fishy and to rich. In all honesty all the food I tried off my friends plates with great. Even though we were full we got desserts to share, the bread pudding, Gateau of Chocolate, and Pear Tarte Tatin with Cinnamon Honey Ice Cream, none of them could I find anything wrong with.Overall all I think I found my new go to place, besides the bartenders I cant find anything majorly wrong. The FOOD is so good that it makes up for them. If you must choose a place this week to eat I strongly recommend this place!!!!, Ill keep it short;Appetizers;The raw seafood is excellentThe mussels were greatThe avocado / hearts of palm salad was delicious and the presentation was nice. Probably a bit too much Mayonnaise.Entres;The pork loin with cabage was very niceThe beef was *mediocre*Dessert;Tart tartan - the pear was under cooked but the icecream was delicious (*disappointing*)Beers;DeliciousService; Very goodFacilities; Very nice, unless you need to get to the bathroom.. to get to the bathroom you have to pass through a narrow gauntlet by the bar.. its nearly impossible to avoid having someone step on your toes or elbow you.., I try not to review places that have a lot of reviews however, Brasserie Beck is that exception. My former boss took me here for dinner. From the moment we went in the service was exceptional. The place is fairly big with high ceilings and there are clocks everywhere noting the time all over the world.The food was excellent. The spinach salad for devine and big enough for two. When we told them we would share they brought it out on seperate plates and we didnt have to ask for this. Next they brought our entrees which have such a lovely appearance. I ordered the rabbit which was devine.I wish I had of reviewed this place sooner because I cant remember all the details. I will return to this place soon., Dinner was great, but the real treat was the French bread. Otherworldly. Ill go back just for that., Ie been here twice now, and Il definitely keep going. Everything Ie had is excellent: the skate, the braised ribs, the cassoulet, the duck. Another thing: I don drink beer. Hate beer. So when the beer sommelier (who is apparently knighted?!?) stopped by our table and heard that I don drink beer, he said, Then I know exactly the beer for you. I was skeptical. He brought me a tiny mug of the Duchesse De Bourgogne, and he was right. It was delicious. Who knew I was a Flemish-red-ale kind of girl? Full disclaimer: We know someone who works here, so we get great treatment when we go. I can comment on the service from any other perspective., I really love good beer.Match that with excellent food and attentive service and I am pleased. Before we sat at our table, I had a few beers at the bar; the campus was good if you like sweet, fruity beer. We ordered the frites and clams to start and they were both terrific. The dipping sauces for the fries were good and the fries crispy. The best part of that was the clams, though. They were big and delicious. For dinner, I had the rabbit and it was also good.Our waiter was very attentive and knocked down the price of the wine to the bottle I had originally ordered but was out of stock. All around, this was a very good experience and I look forward to going back., I finally made it to Brasserie Beck to celebrate my roomies first quarter-century on Earth. We were a bit early for our reservation and prepared to camp out at the bar, but the host offered to seat us early. Fantastic!The decor is very open and inviting, with uber high ceilings and small tables scattered throughout. There were no booths or private areas--- I definitely wouldnt describe it as cozy. This luckily gave us the opportunity to openly check out the hottie seated at the table next to us. As we scanned the menu we all had a very difficult time coming to a decision: duck, pork, salmon, soups, bass, chicken, steak, croque monsieur (my fave!), salads, skate wing: it was almost too much to take in. I asked our waiter for his recommendation and settled on the grilled steak with green peppercorns. We also decided to split the Napoleon tomato salad.My roomies loving father had pre-bought a bottle of wine for us, which was great. Im much more of a beer person so I made a point to scan the menu--- impressive. I will definitely return to camp out at the bar and try a few more of these, but the Bavik pilsner I had was mighty tasty. The tomato salad was solid (and spurred a discussion of how everything is better with goat cheese) and I imagine it would be lightyears better during the summer. My steak was also very good and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. It was VERY peppery (which I love) so be careful if thats not your thing. Both roommates raved about their dishes: the striped bass and the pork tenderloin. The waiter also brought out a piece of their chocolate cake for the birthday girl, with candle. The cake was great: topped with ganache and a rich mousse-like filling.I will definitely return to Brasserie Beck, especially because I was surprised that the final tab wasnt too high... definitely low enough to come back without having a particular reason.A tip: when making reservations, you may be better off to call the restaurant than deal with OpenTable. They had many more spots available when I called., My husband had been here with some coworkers for his summer job, so we finally decided to go to Brasserie Beck for a date night. The atmosphere inside is quite on the mark as far as brasseries go, with large steel clocks and tiles floors. The beer menu, as expected, is thicker than any food or wine menu youll see here. I was kind of disappointed that our waiter couldnt really make a confident beer recommendation to my meal, but I think it was also his first day so I forgive him. The way to go at Brasserie Beck is to order one of the three mussel dishes - I would go with the traditional white wine and garlic broth - with fries (comes with three kinds of mayo dips - garlic, curry and something else). They also have a party room that probably fits about 30-40 people, which can be set up nicely for private events., Brasserie Beck, you have my heart!The five stars is for a wonderful experience with a huge assortment of AMAZING Belgian beers; the food on its own would get 4 stars.I had dinner here with two friends last night, and what started at 6:45pm somehow ended at 11pm. Thats how much fun we had. Our waiter, Joe, was the best thing since sliced bread. I know Bill the Bald Beer Sommelier is the king, but Joe is damn amazing, too -- he knew the beers like the back of his hand, made recommendations to us each based on what we already knew we liked and also what we were eating -- and at the end of the evening he even just took back a bottle that we didnt like just because we didnt like it (one of their most expensive bottles!) and gave us a couple new different beers on the house. Joe also knew the food menu inside and out (details about the oyster varieties, spices in sauces, etc). Really great waiter. He also never made us feel like we were taking too much time to get our drunk asses out of the restaurant (over 3 hours for dinner!). I am a wine drinker, but I still cant get over the beer - it was AMAZING.The food -- muscles in white wine/garlic were HUGE and the soupy sauce was great soaked up into the fresh hot/crunchy French bread; the duck confit starter was really quite delicious (salty, and the sweet fruity sauce its served with makes the dish); main courses were a bit more boring (the rabbit was yummy, but a halibut special and the bass were both just a bit dull). We tried a waffle with mango as well as a strawberry banana mousse topped with chocolate ganache for dessert, and though both were as yummy as I expected, neither one caused me to get up on the table and dance. It was the beer that did that. I have the hangover to prove it.:), My wife and I live close to Brasserie Beck, and we really wanted to like this place. Weve tried BB several times. Each time its been bad. When we went for dinner, I had absurdly over-salted steak frites, my wife had an over-salted Spaetzle. We went for brunch another time and I ordered a Belgian waffle. Instead of bringing me the breakfast waffle with fruit I ordered, the inattentive waiter brought what I can only guess was the dessert waffle. It was covered in ice cream and two (maybe three) strawberry slices. My wife ordered eggs over easy with potatoes and the dish arrived cold. Bogus! When I went for some frites and a beer at the bar, the bar staff was friendly and helpful, but they were out of the beer I tried to order--de Koninck, I think. The frites are more or less long salt crystals. The mayonnaise sauces that came with the frites had skin. So, in summary, if youre in the mood for some salt, definitely check out Brasserie Beck., Great beer selection- great food. A little pricey., Roommate: Did you hear that Brasserie Beck is opening an outdoor patio for the summer?Me: Word. That dangerous (we live at 10th and M)Surprisingly, my roomie hasn gone yet, but I made it a point to do so after pounding a few Deutsch biers at Cafe Mozart up the street. I suppose you could say we went to brasserie beck for 4th meal. Yes, I just used a Taco Bell marketing slogan to describe my experience at the Classerie Brasserie Beck, but merely because it was a 4th meal! That where the similarities end....We sat down at about 9:30 pm on the patio. Our waiter, who I believe was already discussed up top, was Joe. He was extremely personable, knowledgeable, and professional. His schpeel was a little bit long given the condition we were in, and that it was just two buddies grabbing a bite to eat, but nonetheless impressive - went through those specials flawlessly. Reminded me of me, back in the waiting days. Joe also scored points for confirming that truly fine restaurants don let their wait staff wear name tags or say Hi I so and so - they let the patron ask if they want to. This settled an argument my buddy and I were having over why I thought Ruth Chris was nothing more than a Fridays w/ better beef. Moving on....some basic rules to follow: RULE #1: YOU MUST ORDER BEER HERE! Gotta start with some good olbelgian beer here. And don go ordering Chimay, because that lame and you can buy that in stores. You need to try the truly unique beers - ask the waiter or bar tender at these joints for a recommendation based on your personal preference, theyl pair you up with something good. Me? I had some apple beer that I can remember the name of. Normally would have gone for the Delirium Tremens, but opted for something new - since it was 4th meal, I was thinkindessert. RULE #2: YOU MUST TRY THE MUSSELS HERE...They have AMAZING mussels at Brasserie Beck. Generally 3 different types of sauce accompany said mussels - you choose the one that suits you best. We tried the yellow curry and apple (went well with my beer) sauce, and it was delicious. Pretty rich, as you can imagine, but awesome. I have found with mussels that generally youe bound to get one that doesn taste all too good, and most are small. NOT HERE! These are enormous mussels, each of them delicious. RULE #3: DIP YOUR DELICIOUS FRENCH BREAD IN THE DELICIOUS MUSSEL SAUCE. I am a bread critic. I one of those guys who will go into an Italian or French place and be really disappointed if the bread sucks. The bread here is amazing, and very important when you consider how great the sauces are with their dishes. RULE #4: BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR ENTREE CHOICEBuddy and I decided to order sandwiches. Idiots. At that point in the evening, we thought don order the $40 entree, youe too drunk to appreciate it. Also makes sense that we crave the more greasy sandwich - I can recall what he had, but I had a Salami + Prosciutto sandwich. It was way too greasy, and way oversalted. I dontknow if they take the already sodium-filled cured meat, and just cover it in salt or what, but it was literally almost inedible. Okay, not inedible, but definitely like DAMN, that a lot of salt! We skipped dessert, as that would have been 5th meal and we didn want to be gluttonous, and went straight for the check. Prices here are expensive enough that you do not want to be getting popped here, as beers can be upwards of $10-12/glass, but definitely worth a nice dinner to celebrate an occasion, a fancy date, or a round of mussels and beers when youe looking to just enjoy the outdoors and people watch on a Sunday afternoon. Bottom line: Well done Richard Wiedmeier, you rock yet again - but ease up on the salt, would ya?!?!?!?!, Brasserie Beck has been on my list of places to try for quite some time. My friend and I decided to come here to celebrate her graduation from college and we had a fantastic evening! This was really the perfect place for our night out.Our reservation was at 7:30 but we both got there a half hour early. No problem - we checked in and then wandered over to the bar to have a beer while we waited. Friendly bartenders presented us with the big beer book. My friend got a Delirium on draft and I got a bottle of Chimay. Now, I know what youre thinking...COME ON, ALICIA...be more adventurous than that. Well, before you yell at me (especially Liam), Belgian cuisine/beverage isnt a special/rare occasion for me. My parents live in Brussels - so Ive tried a lot of beers and foods, etc... and I just wasnt feeling adventurous to try new things that night because Id been really sick most of the week and didnt think my stomach could handle it. And as it turned out, the Chimay paired well with my entree.After about 20 min, the host came over to the bar to let us know our table was ready. We closed our tab and then were seated. We probably should have asked to have been seated on the patio, but we were seated at a cozy, quiet table inside which suited just fine. The restaurant is bright, beautiful and clean. The kitchen is pretty much open and the staff - from busser/runner/servers were really friendly. Our server was Brian - and he was really great. There when we needed him, answered all questions, was able to make recommendations, etc. He had a cute accent too.To start, I had the 3 cheese sampler and my friend had the tomato/goat cheese napoleon. I have no idea what cheeses I had and I didnt ask - but they were all delicious! They were served with some almonds, cippolini onions and some sort of gellied somethings. Hah. I used the bread with the cheeses. Ahhh the bread. God I love carbs. I could never do Atkins...Id fail everyday. The bread was perfect - warm, crunchy crust but soft on the inside - this is the kind of baguette that I dream of. S o g o o d!! (Picture of the cheeses posted above).Okay. Now before you yell at me for a second time.... Yes, I read the reviews. Yes, I know the mussels and the frites are what I should order. HOWEVER, ((said in a tiny voice)), I dont like mussels. I know, I know...Im hanging my head in shame. But I dont. My friend does - so she got them. She chose the white wine/garlic sauce. I ended up getting the Duck Congolese. My friend LOOOOOVED the mussels and the sauce - she said there was the perfect amount of garlic and flavor. And yes, she used the bread to mop up the sauce in the pan. The frites that came with the mussels were great! The trio of mayos were also very tasty - a curry one, a plain mayo and we were a little uncertain of what the pink/orangish one was - but still good. My duck was cooked perfectly to medium. Overall, I really enjoyed the dish; my only complaint was that there was an overwhelming amount of raisins on my plate - in the couscous and on top of the duck. The sliced almonds were a nice accent in addition to some sort of creamy greens on top of the couscous.I was stuffed by the time we finished second courses. But we trudged on...we were not going to pass on dessert. The original plan was to do the waffle of the day...that is, until our server told us there were bananas on it (I hate bananas). So we ended up getting the chocolate cake. I was so glad it wasnt a big cake... sort of the size of a regular hamburger patty. The cake was pretty rich - but so good. There was some sort of a mousse and a crunch in it. I ate as much of it as I could, but my friend was the one who ate the majority of it. I was just too full! (See picture posted above)We were both in a serious food coma by the time we left. We had an amazing time and both are looking forward to planning a second visit - on the patio., Excellent. The food, the BEER, and also the BEER! A group of 7 of us went here last night to celebrate a friends birthday. He had recently traveled to Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands and was missing the cuisine. He left a very satisfied birthday boy.There were nothing but compliments about all of the dishes we ordered to include spaetzle, pork belly, croquettes, steak, beef carbonnade, salmon, and of course mussels (fennel and chorizo sauce for the record). Our waiter was very patient with us and was more than happy to recommend beers when we became overwhelmed by the big beer book. I enjoyed the Bacchus (dont be fooled by the dark color, it is sweet and tastes like cherries), Piraat (very smooth, a little spicy), Kwak (not too sweet, just a little hoppy which I love), and Scotch de Silly (one of my favs, full flavor, rich, a little smokey). The highlight of the night came when we were getting ready to call it a night. Bill the beer sommelier had been traveling by our table all night between the bar and what we learned was a beer tasting he was holding in an adjacent room. He noticed we had a ridiculous amount of empty beer glasses on the table so he stopped to chat. After he learned of our great appreciation for beer, he allowed us to sample a rare 1997 Samichlaus (allegedly the last keg in the world) which he had been showcasing in his beer tasting. Sweet jebus this is good beer!! You would never know it is at about 18% (until you try to walk out the door). It is mildly sweet, spicy, malty, smooth, and flavorful all at once. One of the best beers Ive ever had...and Ive had A LOT of beer., I really enjoy this restaurant. My mediocre star rating is an average of my two experiences. The first time I went was excellent - five stars worthy. The second time was barely two stars. The difference is mostly in the service.The first time I really treated myself. I was there to taste beer. Having spent some time in Belgium, the beer list was dear to me. :) I ordered the tomato-goat cheese Napoleon to start. Very good - nicely prepared. FYI - it comes with bacon on top, so if youre veggie, you should request without. The salad was very good, exactly what I expected.I asked my waiter, David (fantastic guy!) what he suggested for a main course and he directed me to the striped bass, which I would never have chosen. It was excellent! I was so pleased that he suggested it. I also had the potato gratin with pork belly - very tasty!The beer sommelier was incredibly helpful in navigating the beer list. So helpful that I was quite drunk by the time I left! :)The second time I went, I started with the appetizer special - veal sausage. It was very good. I decided to go traditional on the entree and ordered the moule frite. The mussels were the biggest Id ever seen and too grainy. The frites were good and the sauces they offered were excellent.The dessert of Belgian bread pudding was quite tasty.It fell short on the service, this time. I suppose it could be the difference between a Friday night and a Saturday night.I will be back, Ill just request David and more beer. :), Bill, Brasserie Becks beer sommelier, is a total and complete rock star. This guy totally made my Wednesday night by teaching me more about beer over the course of a few hours than the combined knowledge Id gained in the time Ive been legally allowed to drink beer.Sour beer, smoky beer, beer in a wine-like bottle, a taste of the last of an extremely rare keg of beer.If you want to go on a beer adventure, belly up to the bar and ask for Bill! No one should leave DC without this experience., Hands down, the best thing about this restaurant is the beer. Ie got to admit, it quite overwhelming when youe handed a 10-page beer list, but our server was quite good at making suggestions and bringing us samples of a few of the Belgian brews to try. Ultimately, my friend and I both got the Bacchus, which is described in the beer menu as having the aroma of sour cherries and aged in oak barrels. It was wonderful.The food was good, but nothing to write home about. Had a potato leek soup - and then two appetizers - shrimp croquettes and a salad of hearts of palm, shrimp, and avocado. The croquettes were quite good, but the salad was over-onioned.The atmosphere is all about money money money. Everyone there looks like theye got a lot of it, and wants to show it off.Still give it three stars though - lots of points for the beer, and I still had a great time with a friend I hadn seen in 12 years. I go back again, but just to sit at the bar and drink beer., My parents took my family and me here for my college graduation and we sat in the special chef table by the kitchen so we could watch them prepare the food. The restaurant had just opened and they were still figuring out operations & whatnot...but the place was incredible!! The food, wine, service, was all perfect! I couldn have picked a better night! When our main courses were ready, about a dozen food runners came out with one plate in each hand, and we were all served simultaneously. It doesn get much better than that., Just a quick business lunch on 7/11/08. Food was well-executed though unremarkable, but it was just lunch. Deserves a second visit for a more complete meal and tour of the beer selection., Great food, great beer, great atmosphere. Good place for a date as well, although it can be a bot loud..., I really wanted to love the food here but I found it to be just OK. First, I had a beer at the bar while waiting for my friends. It was a rare beer not carried in the U.S. and the bartender did a great job of explaining some things to a non-beer drinker like myself and I enjoyed my glass of Alveder (sp?). Then when seated, my party requested to sit outside, where there were many tables open, but we did not get greeted for at least 10 minutes. The waitress seemed a little frazzled but we were just enjoying sitting outside. We ordered the garlic and white wine mussels and I have to say they were the best part of the night. The mussels were a nice size and the broth was so good with the crusty bread. The entree I got was a different story. It was basically duck a la almond, with cous cous. The duck was horribly overcooked and covered with flavorless almonds and some apricot. The couscous was overpowered by raisins, apricot, and what I think was allspice or nutmeg or clove - either way all the flavors just did not meld together well at all. My friend had an OK salad and my other friend had the traditional french ham and cheese. Oh and the pomme frites were good but I did not care for the mayo dipping sauces that tasted like they were just thrown together with no thought. So to save yourself some money, I would say go to the bar, order a nice beer or glass of wine, get mussles as an appetizer, and just chill :), Dropped in for a late lunch and they were still serving Sunday brunch. Had poached eggs with hollandaise and goat cheese. It was delicious! Also, had a weird craving for more carbs, so I went with the pomme frites, which were perfect with three different mayonnaise for dipping. I would have given more stars if the service wasnt average. The waiter seemed to be going for pretentious ennui but came off as tired with bad feet. Also, I hate to walk into a restaurant and receive a blank look from the maitre d. Duh!?, Another place thats a victim of its own success. I was there last night and like the 2 prior visits it was: (a) A total insane asylum in the bar - just getting to the lady handling reservations felt like I was back on the rugby pitch, and to be seated we had to literally push our way through to the (relatively) open air of the restaurant. Total fire hazard.(b) Seriously deficient service. When our waiter did show his face, you could tell he was in a massive hurry. Though he expertly answered our Qs about the menu, his impatience was rather annoying. Then our beers didnt show up until 10 minutes after the food. 45 minutes later, no sign of our waiter or even a busboy to clear our dirty dishes, and it was impossible to catch the attention of any other waitstaff - they must take a class in avoiding eye contact.(c) But, the saving grace is the food. Everything youve heard about the mussels is right. They ARE wonderful. But the pork belly appetizer is even better. Dont let the name fool you - its divine. Just melts in your mouth. Ive found the fries hit or miss on different occasions but the belgian beers are always good.Verdict: the food and beers make it worth it, but be prepared to fight for your seat and attention from your server., Let see, Ie been to Beck many many times this past year. First time was just a month after they opened, and I was hooked then. They have great service, great mussels/frites, and great beer, what more can you ask?Favorite main courses include pork tenderloin (love the cabbage sauce), best grilled trout in town (it the light yet wonder lemon caper sauce), and the steak. Not that crazy about Choucroute en Croute, it a lot of food, but I think it more a guy dish.I had my bday there, my bf bday there, and another friend bday there, and because we love their dessert! I love their bread pudding, bf loves their belgium waffle, and the chocolate cake is yum too.One tip, they serve dinner Sunday night at lunch price, that a few dollars savings per dish. Good deal., The FRIES that come with the moule frites. I love the 3 dipping sauces - curry, sun-dried tomato/tomato and a standard aioli. Of course the moules (a.k.a mussels) are probably the best around town! This is what I had the first time. On 7/28 we paid our second lunch visit to BB. The weather was perfect and sat outside. Coming on a Monday is a nice change from the typical fast-paced and crowded ambiance at BB. Downers: the (2) Hoegaarden (HG) on tap we requested, we had to wait for as the lines were frozen. Then my hubby asked for a different beer and it wasnt available and then decided to wait for the line to unfreeze. Our server was attentive enough to bring a tasting portion of another beer that she felt was comparable to the HG. At the end of my meal I asked for a soy latte, but they didnt have soy! Soy milk? I know BB isnt pushing much soy milk, but for their clientele it should be available.Subpar: Tried the skate and it was OK. The pomme puree was solid and the spinach...it was spinach.. I prefer the skate at The West End Bistro at The Ritz-Carlton.Uppers: Split pea soup: DELICIOUS and the presentation was lovely. LOVE THEIR ICE TEA PRESENTATION. I feel simple syrup (or even agave syrup) should always be offered as you dont have to wait for sugar crystals to...well...never dissolve. DESSERT: great sorbets and I had their lemon cake (not official name), which was divine. Looking forward to our 3rd visit...., I read a lot of the reviews here. And agree with most. Brasserie Beck is great. I give it 4 stars because if you dont have a reservation you can wait forever, and they still might stick you at a bistro table near the bar. Which is probably fine on Sunday night, but any other night its loud. Get the reservation, and then you can give it 5 stars.That being said, everything else is amazing. The food was great. I had the Pork Tenderloin. Its well worth a try. If you like trout though, get the trout! My wife had it, and its awesome. The beer menu is unbelievable. If you like Pils I would recommend the Bavik. The Delirium is another great option from the draught selection. Chocolate Cake.....GOOD! As for the service. I read many reviews knocking it. I have been to the bar a few times and dinner once. This is not Bennigans, its a little more refined, so the staff is going to have more attitude. However, they are very knowledgeable and efficient. I asked the waiter a few questions, and I know they hate that, but he was very helpful.I will be going back ASAP. I want to try the Sunday brunch in the fall outside on the nice patio., Fantastic, incredible, amazing! On a gorgeous Saturday night one of my fellow beer geeks and I indulged ourselves at Brasserie Beck. I arrived early and was greeted promptly and was escorted to the bar for pre-dinner drinks. This was great, I had some time to look through their very impressive beer list. The bar staff was attentive and helpful in trying some new things, and also poured the beers correctly. As you are escorted to your seat, you have the opportunity to glance in the kitchen, where you see all the magic happening and the decor is comfortable. We started our meal with a visit from Bill Catron the house beer specialist, which i must say has the best job ever :) We picked his brains on what to have with our first course Mussels and the frites with the trio of sauces. He told us about one of their brand new saisons that hadnt even been updated on the list, the pairing was spot on! The second course was their Braised Pork Belly with Rice Beans. The pork was so tender and delicious, it literally melted in my mouth. Bill again was more than helpful on selecting another fantastic brew to pair harmoniously with this plate. Before we could move on the third course Akim our waiter encouraged me to soak up the jus from the Pork Belly, extra brownie points for him :) On to our third course we selected to go with the Roulade of Duck Confit with the Pomme Puree. Again the kitchen did another phenomenal job with presentation and flavor, if you got a little of everything in one bite, mmm delicious. By this time Bill was elbows deep with everyone wanting recommendations but he still had time to fit us in and make sure that the pairing was working. After all that we still had room for dessert and an espresso. I highly recommend the Pear Tarte Tatin, it was very good, and after all the beer the shot of espresso was a very welcomed shot of energy. In Short- Anybody who proclaims their love for beer this is most definitely their mecca and should bow down to the beer gods and thank them. The food, service, an atmosphere were accommodating and more than inviting. I can not wait to go back! The dreams i had last night were incredible, i can not wait to take my friends and loved ones to Brasserie Beck., Yum, yum yum. Yumyumyum. Im no longer a Beck virgin! Thank goodness for an office expense account and the need to take my chairwoman to dinner! Beck was simply amazing. And I didnt even have beer! (Yes, you read that correctly.)Everything about my experience at Beck was top notch. The service, the atmosphere, the food. I am so glad I picked this place to entertain one of my volunteers - she loved it too. STILL talking about it.So, to start, my dining companion had an order of the mussels with fennel and chorizo. She just couldnt believe that mussels and chorizo would work. She was also expecting just a small bowl. In reality, she got a HUGE bowl of mussels in a fabulous tomato-ey broth with chunks of chorizo. It is definitely enough for a meal, or an appetizer for two. I sampled some of the mussels and they were divine. Oh and lets not forget the frites that come with the mussels and 3 wonderful dipping sauces. They were perfect. I had the spinach salad to start and it was also quite tasty - a HUGE portion to be sure. Yeah, we were going to be full before dinner.For dinner, we each had the monkfish that was served on a bed of whipped potatoes and olives and peppers. It was actually perfect. A nice light option after those huge appetizers. The fish was perfectly cooked and I loved the combo of the olives and peppers with the potatoes. It just worked. My fellow diner also agreed that it was tasty to be sure.So, we were absolutely stuffed. But then our server comes and tells us about the Pear Tarte Tatin. He sold that thing. SOLD IT. We ordered one to split. It was heaven. Baked to order, served with vanilla ice cream and a caramel sauce. Seriously, no words. No words. Just take the plate away before I lick it (and embarrass everyone around).This is a fine example that other restaurants should try to follow. From the comfy decor to the open kitchen and great looking bar, to the highly trained servers who know their stuff. Brasserie Beck is a wonderful place. I have already told others to give it a try and I know I will be making a trip back. Oh and I hear theyve got some beer there too., Brasserie Beck is one of my DC staples. But be forewarned: reservations are highly recommended.The restaurant is very chic and well decorated. The staff all look polished and are eager to help you to answer any questions or take care of any special needs. I really enjoy the atmosphere because it is slightly loud so you can bring a big party and not feel out of place or obnoxious.Having recently returned from a Euro Trip, I was very into Belgian beers and Brasserie Beck does not disappoint. The selection is wide and varied and has something to hit the spot whether you like darker beers or lighter wheat beers. If you have never tasted a Kriek before, this is a great place to try it. It is a specialty cherry beer and is delicious paired with their chocolate bread pudding with dark cherries.The food, for the most part, is all very good. The mussels with white wine and butter are fantastic and the waiters sweep the table when they open up your mussels pots which makes for a nice touch. The chorizo and fennel and curry versions are different but interesting and enjoyable nonetheless.I was not so satisfied with the skate entree but that may have been because I thought the portion of fish was not very satisfying. The fish was also pretty salty.There is a delicious pear tarte tatin that is even better when paired with a sweet beer. The staff there is extremely knowledgeable and knows exactly what to recommend based on your tastes. Even better, they always have a beer recommendation for each of your courses as well!Mussels, frites, and beer. What else could a guy want?, Had dinner here last night (Friday) and it was really good. The restaurant is pretty impressive. My wife and I lived in Brussels 5 years ago so we were anxious to have some Belgian dishes again. The menu has a good range of choices to meet different tastes. We started with a 5 cheese plate which was really good. The bread they serve was excellent. The wine menu is very large and the beer menu is incredible. We shared a bottle of red which was relatively cheap.For the main I had the NY Strip which was very good and my wife had a salmon dish which she liked. The portions arent big and not small, just right we felt. We also shared a chocolate cake which was really good.We found the service to be pretty good. Our main server was nice, but he didnt know much about the various dishes. We asked about the different cheeses we were served but all he could tell us was that they came from different animals (Cow, Goat).The prices are on the higher side, but we would try it again in the future., do i really need to write another review for this place? if you are reading this and wonder if you should go there? well, yes do. a colleague at work asked me the other day where he should go to for dinner for his 10 year wedding anniversary, preferably someplace with a touch of french food. i told him i wasnt sure about a french place, but that Brasserie Beck is quite close to french food and amazing. at the end of the day he came back and said he asked a bunch of others, and all had Brasserie Beck as the number one choice, without being asked about the place, but just being asked where to go for dinner. and yes this is how good this place is. and if you like beer, then you will not only be in food heaven, but also in beer heaven., I had dinner here on Saturday night - It was really good, and it was my first time there.I had the mussels with frites - lovely but the sauce was too thick for my taste - I like a lighter sauce with less cream so I can eat my fill of bread with out feeling icky...The Charcuterie plate is a definite starter to have - Yum, beer, proscutio, Duck and Rabbit mousse. Not for your veggie eaters but a nice begin to a belgian inspired meal.The steak I heard (BF had it) was just okay, good, but nothing to go yelp about ;-)Dad had the pork en croute and couldnt stop raving about it. - I may have to try it out.Beer was great We were worried about the place being one of the High prices for not enough food but everyone loved it and left satisfied.The fellas said the toilets were even remarkable. Hmm., The food wasnt as interesting as I expected. I think the apps are the way to go-- more interesting., The food was great, although I see this is listed as French. It technically Belgian, and the menu does a good job of mixing the French and German influences. The pork with confit of cabage (really it was excellent sauer kraut) was fantastic, although I thought my hubby steak with greenpeppercorns, was a little strong. The chocolate cake was ok, and the service was very, very slow. We went here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and felt, while it was some place we go back to, it not the best for a romantic evening out., We were quite disappointed with our dinner at Brasserie Beck this past weekend. We found the food generally bland, especially for what you were paying. For example, my filet mignon special in a mushroom sauce over potato was ok, but for $38, I expected it to pop in my mouth. I ordered curried mussels because I enjoy the dish so much at Bistro Du Coin, but the ones at Brasserie Beck were overwhelmed, heavy with curry flavor and not much else. My boyfriends coq au vin was pretty tasteless in my opinion, and our sorbet trio had flavors that sounded interesting but just tasted bizarre. Cilantro-lime? A better name I think would be Soapy-pucker. I will admit that the beer we had was wonderful, as were the fries. So maybe Id come back if I were sitting on that patio, drinking beer and only eating the fries. But heaven forbid you have to use the restroom on a busy weekend night - youd have to wade through the entire bar area before you get there. Ive never seen such a poor location for a restroom before., It amazing to me how many people reviewed this place either without talking about the BEER or just mentioning the BEER as some kind of afterthought. If youe ALL ABOUT THE BEER, then this is your place. Their Belgian BEER menu leaves ALL OTHERS in the dust. There is nothing like this in DC or probably the Mid Atlantic Seaboard.MUST, MUST, MUST: Ask for Bill Catron, the beer specialist. When you make reservations, ask if he is working that night. This guy lives, eats and sleeps Belgian beers and he will make this evening more special than any youe had recently in DC. Like the guy in the suit commercial, I gonna go out on a limb and say I guarantee it.Beck will help you appreciate beer the way people traditionally appreciate fine wine. The menu and beermeister Bill will help you understand which beers go best with which foods and your particular palate. Don let anyone else (such as your wait person or a manager type person) try to fake recommend a beer you might like. Insist on Bill the beer guy. This place is ALL ABOUT THE BEER. If you like a nice, smooth, dark amber, try the Orval. I loved it to the very last drop and I not even a beer person. Seriously. That how great this place is. That is not to say the food isn fantastic. The mussels were to DIE for. Anyone who finds any fault with them is --well mussel challenged. I sorry but they ROCK. The fresh oysters, lamb, eclectic cheese plate, --on and on and on. And the ATMOSPHERE. This is the place to come whey youe feeling saucy. When you want to dress up and drink up and be out on the town and have fun and feel special and eat amazing food in a place that will make you forget you are in Washington DC. Not that DC is bad, (I love it here) but once in awhile it nice to feel youe in Europe or somewhere else. Brasserie Beck is your place. Big and fashionable and buzzing with cool people who know how to have a good time. An amazing raw bar, high ceilings, and open kitchen so you can watch some of the action.If youe up for some fun, a place that is a symbol of the new DC, and some FANTORGASMIC BEER--then JUST GO HERE!!!!!!!PLEASE, don over-contemplate it. Just go here. Go now. Thank me later.Enjoy....., Friday Oct 24, we had a reservation at Brasserie Beck, a french restaurant in DC (14th and K St). We did not like the hostess, after trying to reseat us from the cashier table, to a cramped up are table, we decided to just go with the first choice we were given. The place has open kitchen, and is long! The copperware were in display but were not in use. We had for appetizer, pork belly, very crispy and grilled to a level of tenderness that is savory. The sauce was also rich in flavor. The bread was warm, small and toasted to crunchy. I ordered the stew infused by belgium beer which was deligious, the sweet potato puree was buttery but a little salty; Jason got Rabbit Loin, delicious with the sauce. The presentation were gorgeous as well. We also got two authentic belgium beer that was very different but great! Overall, we loved the food, and would recommend this place., I don know, there is a phrase that am I groping for - jumped the shark or maybe  sophomore slump but I had very high expectations for this place and they were dashed. Here what I did not expect:1. It full of wankers. 2. It loud. Way loud. Like the isten to us we are all having SUUUCH a great time loud.3. They gave me my Affligem in a water glass. When I pointed this out they straightened it out and comped me one - but still....4. The food - the two sausage special starters ( lamb and veal) were exquisite, the onion soup was, well, onion soup. Of the entrees we had the fish was weirdly over -flavoured the veal was absolutely magnificent and the choucroute was just ok. Is one hit out of three good enough for a place like this? I don think so.5. Yes Zita L - thanks to you I did ask for Bill the beer guy and he is fantastic - worth the price of admission alone, and the beers he recommended were drop-dead-gorgeous ( I should think so at $14 a pop). The beer I had there reminded me how magnificent beer can be - and I spend way too much time drinking basic beers, and not enough drinking the totems of human achievement. Thank you for that Brasserie Beck. The Chevy Chase liquor guy will see less of me lugging out a case of Yuengling and more on quizzing him on the Trappist offerings he has available.So, for me it is still Bistrot Du Coin and Cafe Belga. I will go back to Beck one more time and brave the 1980s era yuppie types who pack out the bar, and I will check it out again, but it is way-too-expensive for what you get - all sizzle and no steak., We could not stop thinking about Brasserie Beck from our recent DC trip. The mussels and Belgium frites were absolutely delicious.... the French bread was nice and warm, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. We used it to soak up every last bit of the sauce that the mussels came in. The environment is classy, contemporary and fun, with the open kitchen visible through glass in the center of the restaurant.But the best part was definitely the beer!!! A whole book of Belgium beer, one and a half pages of Belgium beer on tap. We had a glass of Vuuve and one of Kasteel Rouge. Yummm.... Now that were back in Cali, I can only drool at their online beer menu..., Its a terrible thing to live just two blocks from this place...at least, from my wallets perspective.I absolutely love everything about Brasserie Beck except that Id knock five or ten bucks off the prices and kick some of the overgrown frat boys out of the bar when they get too deep in their cups. Not that the food isnt worth either the price or the annoyance, because it is! Huge fan of the pate de campagne and the beet salad, not to mention a delicious duck almondine, salads filled with chopped egg, blue cheese, bacon, shallots, and all the good stuff that hides the lettuce, homemade lamb sausage, and desserts that shine like a beacon at the end of a night of food and drink -- all are definitely, if not value, then at least more than on the mark for DC price points. The problem is that I want to eat there all the time, and I just cant afford it!Amazingly for giving this place a glowing review, Im also not a beer drinker, which is where BB puts most of its expertise. The wine list is nearly as expansive as the beer list, however, and I have never gone wrong with one of their fine roses or reds to pair with my mussels or their country pate.Highly recommend the patio on the summer, too; perhaps not the most scenic view, but they open up special beer taps just when the outdoor dining area is available, so the beer lover in your life will appreciate it., Really a 3.5 star review and experience. Time crunched without a reservation and new pending in-laws in town, Brasserie Beck agrees to seat us, if we can be done in 70 minutes. Then it takes 5 minutes to get menus and beer/wine lists. 5 minutes for us to come to a decision about food and another 2 minutes for drinks. But then tap beers come in a minute and wine by the glass in 10. Now wee a little time crunched and still seem to be waiting for staff.I had the special of Cassoulet, traditional southern French pork and goose casserole with white beans. This version incorporated 3 of thier starters; duck roulade, duck sausage (devine and fluffy) and pork belly along with said white beans. I found the duck too sweet with raisins in the roulade, even with my 2003 Portugese red (warm vintage and very ripe style).Service was literally grand if a little melodramatic. I mean how many waiters really want you to ask for them next time so they can wait on you again?!?I glad our sever thought all of the dishes were nice or very nice and generally they were. He also did a better than average job of explaining specials, include price (yay!), however he lost his head of steam by the time he got to entree specials and didn give prices.Thanks to in-law parents I didn have to pay, but knowing all of the special prices ahead of time would be nice.I appreciate the professional service, one of the best Belgian Beer lists in DC metro area and the quality of the food. I question the relative value. It was good and slightly too pricey for a once a week or even a once a month splurge. I think I can find a better value to treat myself on a regular basis., Ive posted here before, and what I had to say was important, so Im a bit shocked that my review was DELETED.Like everyone, we had heard good things before dining here and looked forward to our first dining experience. Food was mediocre and service stank, but the worst part of the evening was the credit card fraud. So the waiter stole $50. It happens. But what shocked me was how the restaurant handled it. First, they ignored it. Next, they gave the waiter the benefit of the doubt, even though I had the receipts to prove it.In the end, I had to get my credit card company to refund my money. I never received an apology. I never received a credit for a future visit. I never even got my 20% tip back!My biggest mistake was eating at such a poorly run establishment. My second was that I actually tried to be a good patron. Next time Ill just go to the police., First-time visit for Sunday brunch was rewarded with good service and rich flavors, including steak with poached eggs and sausage and lentils. Tables need to be spaced better to reduce waiter bumping into diners at adjacent table. Party of four was unanimous in praise and satisfaction, in particular superb Belgian winter ale.
11|casa-luca-washington|Truly fantastic! Casa Luca can quicly become the most enjoyable Italian eatery in Washington. The concept is a winner - a combination of little known and classic dishes exquisitely prepared, a very good choice of inexpensive wines and a casual yet special atmosphere. You would want to go for a full meal as there are so many appealing dishes on the menu, but I got the sense that one would feel equally welcomed ordering a glass of wine and couple of small dishes or popping in just for a wonderful espresso in the afternoon. The team behind Casa Luca has been extremely successful with Fiola, their first and more sophisticated restaurant and if they do things right, will do even better with this one., Chef Fabio Trabocchi does it again... Really nice follow up to the much successful, Fiola in Penn Quarter. Chef Fabio proves that when excellent ingredients meet excellent preparation, it always makes for a an excellent meal. Awesome Italian in DC., First meal at Casa Luca and Fabio Trabocchi and his team rock. Amazing on so many levels to include: Truly fabulous food - The Classic Cheese Bread was anything but classic. A mushroom shaped loaf of bread with loads of cheese melts in your mouth.The pasta take it even further, with the gnocchi and ravioli having amazing taste and texture - the gnocchi rich and savory, and the ravioli light and perfect for summer.  Great service - Our waiter Jason was knowledgeable and provided excellent service. Normally for a new restaurant there are hiccups. None here. Strong drinks (Cornicello!) along with draft wines. Have to love it and of course this review is being written while fully appreciating the effect of said drinks.Overall, definitely worth checking out!, Stopped by for dinner last night to check out this new restaurant, Casa Luca. It was not surprising to see that the place was full, given that it is new, so without reservations my wife and I tried our luck with the bar. We stood behind the bar stools for 5 minutes trying to get a drink to no avail. Two bar seats opened up, so we grabbed those and watched the bar staff spend more time making fancy olde-time cocktails than giving us any mind. It took another 5 minutes to get menus and order our drinks.... the same exact thing happened to the couple who sat down next to us. So, our night started on a bad note. Once we ordered food, it came out quick and the service got better. The food is good, from what little we tried. The portions are not grand and it felt that we were not getting what we paid for, but the quality was high, so its a trade off. The decor was standard contemporary ... nothing of interest or cool to write home about., We just got back from Casa Luca and wont be going back due to the food.Service: Was good. The bar tender was very nice and sweet. The hostess was a bit curtail.Appetizer:Classic Cheese Bread, Buffalo Butter - was ok. Hint of cheese flavor. Nothing special. Baked Chich3c di Offida, Red Peppers Marinati - was oily and ordinary flat bread. Entree:Campanella: Prawns, Shellfish Brodetto, Spicy Eggplant Funghetto. - was average. Nothing great. I could make this at home.Spaghetti con i Moscioli: was under season. I to add lots of salt to it. Spaghetti was over cooked and didnt taste like it was fresh/homemade. Portion was decent size.Grigliata Mista di Carni (County Style Selection of Grilled Meats) for 2 - small portion and was bland. 1 piece of meat for each item.Drinks:Acqua della Vita: Hendricks Gin, Mint Simple Syrup, Lime, Cucumber,Club Soda - Refreshing but small size for $13. Not much of cucumber flavor.Overall: Nothing was spectacular or memorable. Everything was just avg or below. A bit overprice. $90 for two., Some tips--Dont order the antipasto misto or the frito misto (we got a large). Both were tasty, but nothing special, and they were very overpriced for the portion size, only feeding ~2 people as an appetizer. Same goes for the bread. It was tasty but $7 for two pancakes? Come on. Do order the pork chop. It was incredible and very fairly priced. I would go back over and over just for that dish. The fusilli was good too, and also a fair price, if not a bit over the top rich. The wine is also a great deal! Love that theyre all the same price so you can try something new without worrying about that. Service was prompt but a bit overbearing--it was hard to have a conversation since we were being interrupted every 5 minutes., The vast majority of Americans are raised on poor excuses for Italian food--spaghetti with Ragu, Olive Gargen, etc. Throw all those preconceived notions aside because CASA LUCA IS THE REAL DEAL. I guessing Casa Luca cuisine is an elevated rendition of what goes around a real old-school Italian dinner table; hearty, lovingly made from scratch by hand, packed with the kind of flavor only wizard-like mastery of freshly grated spices and herbs can offer. THE AWESOME: Good lord, everything was succulent and richly flavored. It worthwhile to slow down and really think about what went into the dish. I found myself doing the same kind if nuanced pallet analysis as during a wine tasting; the sauces are that crazy good and complex. - I got the COZZE ALICIA, which was AMAZING. It was served in a entree-sized portion, which I feel doesn often happen with mussels-based dishes. The smoked potato and subtle inlay of sausage played perfectly with the very meaty mussels. I was stoked. The server encouraged me to order bread, which I declined. You totally don need to order the bread here! There enough of the dish to enjoy without the extra carbs!- One of my dining mates had the CAMPANELLE and it was extremely good. The chef did a great job of making the fresh basil stand out. Be warned that the dish is described as spicy but turned out to have a very mild kick.- The atmosphere and decor are beautiful. Lots of red and exposed wood, elegant but not stuffy. THE NOT-SO-AWESOME: So, I was there with a group of six so we ordered two appetizers, the MISTO and the veggie FRITTI. - The Misto tasted fantastic, but it was hilariously small for the price, $22. The only actual meat on the plate were two small discs of (admittedly amazing) salumi, Then, there were two wedges of cheese, a small slice of bread, and a pot of cherries and mousse. This is great for two or three people to split, perhaps not more than that. - Was not impressed with the Fritti. Just a bunch of fried veggies. - When asked for a wine recommendation, the server wasn as assertive as I would have liked. I wish he been able to talk about the wines and make a definitive recommendation. The servers at Komi were really good at this and made things super easy for me and my indecisive dining partner. TIPS:- Get some of the everyday wine for $28. Killer bargain and the service was great; my glass was never empty. - Happy hour prosecco for $5! Casa Luca is definitely bringing something great to the DC food scene., Chef Fabio Trabocchis culinary excellence sizzles hotter than a DC heat wave! After two visits, my dining companion and I found some titanic home runs in the menu to make it definitely worth the schlep out of our way to Casa Luca.Key hallmarks of Fiola that jump-started it off to such a scorching hot start are evident at Casa Luca, Chef Trabocchis second restaurant named after his son: 1) ultra-premium ingredients prepared with a minimalist touch; 2) cost-to-quality ratio is great for the stellar dishes; 3) Chef Trabocchis daily presence there now to make sure the food is stellar.Dishes not to be missed:- *Mixed Grilled Seafood- *Grilled Lamb Scottadito- Salad of Lettuces with Fruit (from Maria Light Lunch Menu)- Cheese Bread- Sgroppino*These are on the dinner menu but can be ordered during lunch hours (11:30am-4pm).First, the Mixed Grilled Seafood is a must, one of the best dishes we experienced from Maestro, Fiola, or Casa Luca. Ours came with Grilled Octopus, Scallops, Maya Prawns, Monkfish, and Branzino. The octopus was easily the best we ever had, absolutely swoon-worthy for my seafood snob DC. The scallops were like they were picked right out of the shell before being grilled to a peak caramelized sweetness. The prawns were bursting with flavor, particularly the creamy heads and crunchy tail. The monkfish provided textural contrast, like the meat of superb crab claw meat, while the branzinos flavor quietly bloomed with each bite. Along with the Spiny Lobster barely cooked in Seaweed (a daily special at Fiola), this is one of our two most favorite dishes from one of our all-time favorite chefs.The impeccable freshness and intensity of flavors made this decent-sized entree (or jumbo appetizer portion for two) feel twice as satisfying. The quality of the seafood rivaled those of the fanciest sushi restaurants, and the deft light touch of fancy EVOO, herbs (mint, parsley, and dill), and red chili powder for an accent of red hue elevated this dish to legendary status. For an additional herbaceous hit, we added the accompanying salsa verde for the fish. This was so good that no bread, salad, or other side dish was necessary--it would have been a distraction.Also amazing was the Grilled Lamb Scottadito, generous portions of this underutilized cut (chuck rack) entrancingly aromatic with wild bay leaf and rosemary. The crunchy fried bay leaves, garlic chips, and lemon zest added a little more accent to this incredibly tender and flavorful fancy finger food, while the intensely-flavored grilled lemons juice helped to complement the lamb fats richness. Again, so delicious it was that no sides were necessary.For ardent lovers of seafood and meats, ordering a separate salad is very unusual for us. Not so here or at Fiola. The quality of lettuces, radishes, plums, sour cherries, blueberries, pansies, and anything else in peak season chosen for the salad is head-and-shoulders above those at top restaurants. The ingredients are pristinely clean, flavorful, and perfectly textured. Chef Trabocchi brings them harmoniously all together with a light dressing of a delightfully gentle vinaigrette for a bright blend of sweet, tart, cool, crisp, bitter, and savory.Finally, the Cheese Bread and Sgroppino. The former is an absolutely indulgent treat. For $8, it is not certainly inexpensive, but if you take it as a tasting of three cheeses (fontina, parmeggiano, and pecorino) and a slice of decadent buffalo butter, it is reasonable for a cheese/dessert at the start of the meal. The latter is a sorbet blended with Prosecco. Since ours happened to be white peach, it was like a frozen Bellini--lightly bubbly, floral, sweet, and tart.All in all, Casa Luca is an absolute gem shining brighter with the daily presence of star Chef Trabocchi. The quality of ingredients is comparable to fancier older sister Fiola, while the ambiance is higher-ceiled and more down-to-earth while still maintaining a casual elegance. To make things sweeter, they are offering 10% off your bill for the month of July 2013. Go now!, Incredibly delicious porchetta ... Looks like this will be the weekly special on Thursdays. It was extraordinary ... Surpassing anything I have had in Italy ... And so savory and complex in flavor and ample in quantity that one simply can not consume this dish quickly. The prices here are admittedly on the hi end and as some have noted there will be items that merit less than five stars (dont expect much from the cheese bread, for example). But the service, the atmosphere, and the genuine, authentic dishes will compel many return visits., OK, there are some pretty lengthy (maybe real or not.. i think not) reviews claiming this is a 4/5 star place - so i figured Ill chime in.Stopped in last night for a going away dinner.Good: ---Wine, Beer on draft - good selection here, very reasonable Id say. The girls all got carafes of prosecco for $22, They really enjoyed. No complaints here.Bad:---Food - no freebies here. $8 for bread (which should be free, its cheese bread for gods sake) $10 for mini bite stuff $18 for ok sized pasta. I got the corn, mint and prosciutto bite... i could have easily made this at home. The waiter also encouraged us to get a meat or fish entree in the neighborhood of $25-$38... Ill say this is completely unnecessary and would just pile more onto the bill. Go with 1 pasta or 1 meat/fish. (Im not going back, this is just advice)Anyways - we all got a pasta as our main course...id say really nothing special. I got the prawns - id agree with another review, this is something i could throw together at home. Also, the porchetta wasnt even on the menu.---Service - Terrible. Waiter was fairly inattentive, brought us the wrong bill, didnt evenly split wine on the table so we had to order more. i could go on. Also, the do not seem to know how to clear tables here - we had plates sitting the entire meal - the bus boys just didnt know what the hell they were doing. Seems like overall the staff is VERY new. Fabio has another restaurant - staff should be better trained.Lets call this a happy hour spot at best;. If this place survives downtown - Id be amazed. Perhaps the new City Center traffic will help.They also play top hits music here. I HATE THAT. I dont know where all these other reviewers ate, but my experience was waaaay different., Besides the restaurant being freezing, the atmosphere is lively and modern Italian bistro. Little plates were all good--our large party shared some of everything but no standouts. I ordered a garden house salad not expecting much except some typical greens -- and wow--I am STILL dreaming of the herbed goodness topped with crouton crunchies. So hearty and fresh I may email them for the dressing recipe. Surprisingly the highlight. My gnocchi with duck ragout main dish was way too smoky for my taste. Found it hard to eat. But my guests all had delicious pastas--the simpler the better. The chef even made a meatballs and fusilli (not on the menu) for us. Perfectly succulent meatballs like they do at Fiola with fresh marinara. Definitely recommend this place but order carefully and do your research., Hubby and friends and I did happy hour and dinner at Casa Luca on Friday night, and we enjoyed ourselves. The sparking wine by the glass is a touch too sweet for me, but for $5 at happy hour, it was a nice way to ease into the weekend. Cocktails are great - we ordered both on and off menu, and both were successful (I particularly enjoyed the Cornicello, with tequila, chili-infused Aperol, St. Germain, and lime). We started with some breads, manchego, and a prosciutto and corn starter. Everything was tasty, but the cheese bread disappointed a bit (dry, and not much cheese flavor) - the flatbread was the star of the carbs. We ordered some pasta - bucatini for husband and gnocchi for me. Both were delicious. The duck ragu on the gnocchi was super flavorful, and very filling - I felt like the portion sizes were more than enough for a dinner portion, since the food is so hearty. We ordered the hazelnut coffee cake for dessert. Yum - great texture, and the caramel gelato that came with it was some of the best I have ever had. Service at the bar was excellent. We drank quite a bit, 4-5 rounds for each of us, so the tab was bigger than I was anticipating - but I feel that the prices are reasonable for what you get and you can certainly have a less expensive meal., Awesome new restaurant in DC! I had vegetarian ravioli and friend had another pasta dish. They split or for us. Both pastas were fresh and homemade, good flavors (albeit a bit salty). Had summer squash in a gratin sauce as side. Delish! Service is impeccable. Recommending to all my friends who work down there. Great place for a business lunch!, several things to love about this place but the price is not one of them.$22 (approx) for 500ml of wine = love.service = excellent.porchetta. really good and savory. great to share because they give you more than enough. youll also just feel guilty if you devour it all by yourself.their cheesebread is okay, not a must. but the one with the tomato on top is a true appetizer, fresh and gets your stomach ready for a big meal., Food was honestly delicious, and Im very critical of Italian food, having lived there for quite a while.I had the Smoked Potato Gnocchi/Duck Ragu and it was superb. Great flavor, and the gnocchi was not very heavy, but rather much lighter -- showing the quality of the gnocchi. I also tried a bit of the Tortellini which was also wonderful.The Spicy Calabrese Nduja sausage was marvelous, actually a spreadable sausage.For dessert, I had the affogato, which, albeit tasty, was not nearly as good as they talked it up to be. It was basically a hot fudge brownie sundae in a cup with some espresso-flavored chocolate syrup. None of the flavors particularly stood out.I also tasted the Wildflower Honey Custard, which was like a flan with wildflower honey on top instead of caramel. Id say the custard should have been a bit more flavorful, as there was virtually no flavor imparted except by the wildflower honey (which was delicious).Also, I understand its Italian family-style, but there should be more options for people ordering single dishes and not sharing. I came here just wanting a light dinner option, a little meat and veg. Definitely not the place for that. The side options are lacking quite a bit -- there really needs to be more vegetable options.Also, put some freaking bread on the table. Ive never been to a restaurant in Italy that doesnt have bread -- its part of the coperto!, Excellent food, excellent service. The second time I went was as good., Always wanted to go to Fiola, a little out of my price point, so I was excited for the more affordable version, Casa Luca. I mean, its not cheap, but compared to Fiola, and for good food, I say its great!Service: 2 different experiences on the same night. I sat at the bar for a bit while waiting for my friend and felt like I had to flag down the service staff to help me. Was it because I was alone, sitting in between men wearing expensive suits? I dont know, I was a tad bit disappointed about that, but I guess it was a busy night. During dinner though, our main course was running a little late, and even before we had to ask about our main course, they brought out gazpacho to taste while waiting and I did appreciate that. Its the little things people! You dont even have to give me free food, just let me know where my food is.Food: Had the smoked potato gnocchi and absolutely fell in love. My other friend had the fusilli which was amazing as well with the burratta. LOVE. The Thursday special, porchetta, I was less impressed by, but still, finished the plate!All in all, I would go back, I enjoyed my bowl of pasta, the appetizers were fine (not spectacular, which was funny since recently Ive been loving appetizers at restaurants more than the entrees recently). Would like to go back to the bar and try it out., After trying Fiola (which I loved), I was eager to try Casa Luca. The food, drinks, and experience did not disappoint. The restaurant is quite spacious. Theres a bar area and lots of dining space for patrons. My boyfriend and I were seated in a corner table and it felt very cozy. Our waiter was very friendly and polite, recommending certain dishes to us, answering our questions, and generally being very attentive and interactive. My boyfriend ordered the Il Palio cocktail, which is buffalo trace bourbon, cocchi vermouth, campari ice, and orange bitters. He really enjoyed it. I ordered the Acqua Della Vita - Hendricks gin, mint simple syrup, lime, cucumber, and club soda. I really liked my cocktail too; it was refreshing and light. Perfect for a hot day.For the entrees, I ordered the popular bucatini campagnola - cured pork guanciale, pecorino cheese, and parsley. The smell as the dish was placed in front of me was intoxicating and the taste...so, so good and for only $16. It was so filling I didnt even finish. My boyfriend got the fusilli, which was made with sheeps milk cacio cheese, black peppercorns, burrata, and basil. I thought it was good too, but I much preferred my bucatini. Next time, I want to try the gnocchi, which is another popular and supposedly delicious dish. On Thursdays, they have porchetta, which is a savory, boneless Italian pork roast. Sounds amazing. Definitely need to come on a Thursday too. For dessert, we shared the Luca Macedonia, which consisted of summer stone fruits and Sorbetto del Giorno. The fruits were figs and peaches. Very tasty and light, a good summer dessert., This was honestly one of the worst experiences Ive had! Do NOT waste your money, time and body temperature on this place. I will NOT be going back.The menu leaves a lot to be desired (loaded with pork and no variety), the prices are inflated, quality poor, service so-so, the decor is..think an average crappy chain restaurant whose idea of a salad is shredded iceberg lettuce. Its just blah... no character, no soul, nothing... so sterile and bland.And it was FREEZING! I had on a long sleeve shirt and had put on my fleece jacket. and was still cold. Nothing on the menu was appealing. I wanted a dinner salad, some greens, some protein... so they offered to put monkfish on top of the ONLY one green salad option that exists on the menu. This goopy mess came with 2 tiny and rubbery pieces of fish. price: $28. I will pay good money for good food - but this was just simply sub sub-par. Frankly, it was crap. (3 stuffed olives do not make an appetizer.) And they charged $8 for 2 pieces of bread.The waiter seemed annoyed with almost every table he waited on, but Ill give him some credit for at least trying to be nice. All in all, I paid $65 for a crappy salad, a glass of wine and some warm bread. I tipped the waiter well - he was trying & its not his fault the food is bad. You wont miss anything if you pass on this place. I know I am not going back. Ever., The restaurant has a good vibe with a relaxed atmosphere; plus it smelled fantastic!My meal was good but not great. I expected more. In my opinion they are trying to put out simple, rustic italian food, but cannot resist themselves and mistakenly take it up a notch, when in all honesty some things are better left simple. Yes, I would definitely go back again. Bottom line - I ordered the wrong dishes. I paid $84 (including tip) for one cocktail, appetizer, meal, coffee and dessert.Heres what I hadAppetizer:Porchetta Tonnato (Roasted Pork Loin, Tonnato Sauce, Giardiniera)At a whopping $24, yes, thats right, $24 for my appetizer, I expected a little more. yes, it was good, more than good, but I have had better. If you have never had it, you should. I have considered making this myself, but know its not easy or quick to do, so when I saw it on the menu I had to try it. The dish is tissue thin slices of pork sitting on a sauce of pureed tuna. I know sounds a bit odd but trust me its very good. Yes, this was nicely done, but too glamours for me, it should have been kept simple on several fronts. As for the price, it is definitely overpriced for the VERY SMALL portion, I can see $16 but $24 was a bit much. All that being said, I would happily eat it again - if someone else paid for it.Meal:Bucatini Campagnola Cured Pork Guanciale, Pecorino Cheese, ParsleyIn my opinion this dish was done incorrectly and it was just ok. The first error was the tomato sauce, there was simply too much of it. It appears as if they used their house tomato sauce and added Guanciale, vice properly making the sauce the way it was intended. Tomato should be implied, not overwhelming the dish.Dessert:Ciambellone di Nonna Palmina (Hazelnut Coffee Cake, Caramel Gelato, Vin Cotto)Basically a dry coffee cake. nothing exciting here. The Caramel Gelato was very yummy.The decaf coffee was very good. As was my bourbon cocktail. My friends had the following and I must say they loved all of it. It did look fantastic. Next time I go, I am definitely ordering the BranzinoLeafy Greens, Summer Vegetables, Stone Fruits, HazelnutsBranzino al Forno Red Peppers, Tomatoes, Olives, BasilSummer Beans & Zucchine Almonds, Sugo Finto, Big time fan. More chill vibe than Fiola with unique and excellent food. We enjoyed many half plates of pasta and gnocchi ... a huge plus when you can get a half plate. The duck gnocchi is a star.Very attentive service as well.Not sure what the negative reviews are all about ... but Ill be back .. soon ... to test consistency., Fabio is undoubtedly a very talented chef. The food here is just as delicious as Fiola. Because its meant to be family style, the price tag will be slightly lower depending on how you order. Although I was told that its suppose to be a casual version of Fiola, Casa Lucas interior is just as gorgeous as any high end steakhouse. Our server was welcoming, personable and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. Everything we tried that night was flavorful, well-seasoned and delicious. Clearly, a lot of thought was put into the presentation of the dishes as well which is an added bonus.I left stuffed and very happy.Pro Tip: there is no bread service but the grilled breads on the top left of the menu are all phenomenal., After having experienced Fabios meals at Fiola.. I was expecting something fantastic here. Sady I left feeling let down and fleeced. Service was awful - the waiter lack lustre with nary an opinion or thought about the wines (the list itself leaves much to be desired), meals brought out and given to the wrong people at the table (meat dishes being placed in from the the vegetarians int he group - indistinguishable when its ravioli)... having to wait eons just to order and so on. Now lets get to the food - somewhat lack lustre.. nothing to write home about. Overpowering flavors (nothing subtle here) - how one can mess up a simple Bucatini Campagnola is beyond me.. gloopy, mushy, overpowered with tomatoes losing the delicate flavoring of the pork. Where was the hint of spice to the tongue - perhaps it got lost in the mush that was on my plate. theres nothing special about Casa Luca... mediocre italian food that passes for something in DC --- pedestrian at best. Ill stick to Fiola for now., I really wanted to love Casa Luca. the space is beautiful, the presentation of the food is delightful. Unfortunately there were just a few too many hiccups for me to run back. First of all, the prices are a little high, considering the small-ish portions and the expectation that this is a cheaper Fiola. We went for lunch, and honestly had the most bizarre service. Our waiter was attentive enough, but our entrees literally didnt come out for 45 minutes after we finished our appetizers. FOR LUNCH! We have work, people! It was clear to the waiter that we were getting annoyed, and he came by to apologize and said it would be right out and poured the 4 of us a half extra glass of the wine we were drinking. (I was hoping he would just pour us the whole bottle. If we are going to have a 2 hour lunch, might as well be drunk, right?!?) The manager also came over to apologize, and said the food would be ight out 10 minutes later it came. I can only imagine that the waiter forgot the put the order in. The restaurant wastn that busy, and everyone else around us seemed to be getting their food in a reasonable time frame. In summary, i liked casa luca, didnt love it, and probably will head to Posto on 14th street the next time I get an italian craving., My favorite Fabio restaurant now! (Still my all time favorite was Maestro) I love the decor and less formal setting compared to Fiola. If its your first time here and you want to sample most of his food I recommend doing half portion of pasta dishes so you can try different varieties. For starters, you cant beat the Luca Anitpasta Misto- I mean anyone who can make me eat beets deserves five stars. It was so good. The lunch menu is different then the dinner, but we really loved the Trenette pasta, Ravioli San Leo and spaghetti carbonara. We were pleasantly surprised with the Farrotto of Dorade with mussels and clams. This was my wifes favorite entree.This place was packed even at lunch and I was expecting slow service after reading some Yelp reviews, but our waitress, Lauren, was awesome. She personally recommended the dishes we ordered - you know when you ask your waiter which one is their favorite dishes and they always say all of them and you get really annoyed, but Lauren steered us in the right direction., My family and I were visiting and this place was strongly recommended by our hotel. We were excited to try it out so we made a reservation at 7:15pm. The place was not far so we walked and got there a little early at 7pm. We thought this wouldnt be an inconvenience. However, we waited for 30 minutes to be seated even with a reservation. The excuse was that the kitchen was backed up. We finally were seated and we were greeted by an excellent waiter who apologized for us wait to be seated. We looked over the menu and it seemed we couldnt go wrong with anything we order. We ordered and waited. Then waited longer. It took an hour and a half to receive dinner. My parents finished their bottle of wine before even beginning the main course. Our waiter tried to accommodate as much as he could by serving small appetizers as we waited. We finally got our meal and overall the food was not as great as we expected and not worth the wait. Our dessert was on the house and the only redeeming part of this experience was our lovely waiter. Overall, I will not go back to this place and fall into the hype again., Came here on a Saturday night with my fiancee. We are big fans of Fiola so we were anxious to try this. We had made 9:30 reservations but our night plans got messed up so we showed up at 8:30. They were very friendly and accomodating. It was quite busy but still managed to seat us in only a few minutes. Was very pleased with this.Decor was nice and overall ambience was positive. The waitress came over to explain the menu and I was very disappointed. When a waiter comes to the table to familiarze me with the menu, I don need them regurgitating what on the menu; I can read. I am looking for some insight that will help me in my desicision. That said, she was very friendly.Some yelp reviews recommended the beets/burrata appetizer. I loved it - it was chopped beets (they were very fresh), toasted walnuts, burata and a nice surprise of garlic on the bottom. The burata tasted very fresh. My only complaint was that it was more like a burata with some beets salad. Would have preferred to see more beets.My fiancee ordered the filet mignon (medium rare) and I was in a pasta mood and had read good things about the ricotta stuffed ravioli. Filet Mignon - I thought the presentation was nice and it was cooked with rosemary, garlic, mushrooms, and figs. Very nice collection of tastes. The meat itself was a little on the bland side and we had to add salt. Also, it wasn quite medium rare, it was technically MR, but it skewed towards medium. My dish was more disappointing. The ravioli was a small plate (I should have asked if it was the half portion but I think it was the full). The ravioli itself was pretty good but there was so little of it and the ravioli was swimming in a lemon butter sauce - it overwhelmed the plate. That was disappointing.Lastly for dessert, we had the Affogato - coffee gelato with some croccante and some chocolate on the side. It was pretty good.Overall, I was a bit disappointed in the meal offerings but because it Fiola sister restaurant and because the staff was very good, well give it another chance., Wonderful, wonderful food- The appetizer of maine lobster and artichoke was great. Puttanesca with Mayan prawns, mixed grille, sausage in polenta- it was all amazing. The wines almost better. I highly recommend this restaurant. Love that it is in the local style of the chefs hometown. It shows in the simple grace of the food., Another Fabio restaurant that doesnt disappoint. In a quieter part of New York Ave, and the layout is great.Think of it as a Fiola but with more casual/classical Italian cooking. Go order the monkfish, its pretty epic! Comes out as the full fish, head and all.Pastas are very comfortable in their cooking, and portions are traditionally Italian (between appetizer and entree portions for the pastas, serving as the middle dish)., Love it, love it, love it. We lived in Le Marche so right up front we have a bias. Having said that, the entire team here rocks. Brought 3 generations in tonight for my wifes birthday and youd have thought we were eating in one of my familys home the attention was so great. No hard selling, lots of accommodating (made a 6 and a 9 year old REALLY happy), and really warm service. And then - the food. Cant say enough about it. Polenta con Frutti di Mare? Makes me think about our days at the beach restaurants in Cupra or San Benedetto. The gnocchi with the boar ragu was divine. And to be able to find Ciauscolo (soft salami) in the States and have it be so heavenly - well thats a real treat.Great decor, wonderful people and divine food. Cant say enough about it., Went to this restaurant per Tom Sietsmas review and I felt like I went to a completely different place than he did! Sat down and it took over 15 minutes just to receive our drink order. That should have been the first sign. After ordering, it took another 45 minutes to receive our cold appetizers! The prosciutto dish was good but nothing stellar. Finally after another 30 minutes, we received our pasta dishes. Although good, they were drenched in butter and cheese, no finesse whatsoever. Finally after another 20 minutes, we received the main dish, which was cold, congealed and just inedible. We sent it back immediately. Since dinner took so long, we just wanted the check. But no, instead they sent out 4 desserts for the table, which werent even that good. The staff was really trying to do their best, they were genuine and apologetic but clearly the kitchen was having issues. I hope they figure everything out because it has potential but until then, I would not return any time soon., I was sad to see Againn close, but Casa Luca more than makes up for it. Had the absolute best heirloom tomato/mozzarella/pesto salad. Weve never had anything but small plates and antipasti here but those are so delicious you dont need a big plate of pasta. Sit at the bar and the bartender will let you sample pretty much every wine (on tap!) before making a selection. I would give it 5 stars except its pretty darn pricey. Love that they kept Againns back-lighted bar., Having had the pleasure of dining at both Fiola and Casa Luca, I surprised at the negative reviews for this lovely spot, which does a wonderful job of creating an elegant but still laid-back experience with top-notch food. A few pleasant surprises we experienced:-the wine list has several unique and affordable options with bottles priced at $28 and another chunk of options that are served in carafe portions. Also had a negroni to start that was excellent. The rose prosecco by the glass that I sampled was far less exciting.-the piccoletti menu suggests tiny decadent bites, but the portions we received could easily have been enough of an appetizer for two to share-- we definitely over-ordered here, but were not sorry. The heirloom beets and beef tartare were particularly excellent. The duck mousse terrine blood orange topping was a bit too cloyingly sweet for my taste, though the mousse itself was velvety and delicious.-love the half-portion pasta option, which is also available at Fiola. What a great (and surprisingly easy on the wallet!) way to explore more of the menu-- stand-out favorites for us were the rich cacio e pepe with burrata and the smoked potato gnocchi with duck ragu-- simple dishes with a twist, prepared to perfection. The bucatini dish was less memorable and a bit too salty, but the grilled prawn atop the dish was so succulent and delicious as to make me wish that we ordered the grilled seafood platter for two to share instead... next time!Contrary to other reviews here, we also found the service at Casa Luca to be very good. Our waiter informed us that they are quizzed weekly on the wine and food offerings, and our servers were indeed very knowledgeable. Looking forward to a return visit!, Get the duck Ragu gnocchi in a half order for the table if you dont want to make it your meal, but just make sure you try it. The lamb and fish were just A-OK., I adored our waiter. He worked so hard to treat my gf and I so well. I grew up outside NYC with proper Italian and I LOVE this modern twist Fabio puts on the cuisine. The beets on top of the stacciatella was a great app to start with. Perfect to share. The perfectly pickled beets sitting on top of the stacciatella was a nice, but obvious match. There was a lot of food. The tangy beets were sweetened up by the cheese and the nuts added a nice crunch. I do not like walnuts, but I did LOVE these. We also shared the duck liver mousse. The blood oranges wrecked the taste of the immense flavor of the mousse. It still was enjoyable to spread a ton on top of the toast once you got to it. I love both blood oranges and duck liver, but this was a little wild.For my dinner I had cansunzei stuffed with beets. This is one of the best homemade pastas I have ever had. The soft and delicate flavor of the pasta (looks like a mini perogie) stuffed with a mild beet made it very enjoyable. The sweet brown butter and walnuts on top made it very complex. This was balanced right. The gfs gnocci was pretty basic and uneventful if you ask me. I guess you need to have something light for the picky eaters in the world. This was a near 5 star restaurant if you ask me. I LOVED the experimentation with organic flavors. I felt the duck liver just needed to be a little more simplified, and the gnocci taken up a notch. The wine selection is for everyone. It ranges from cheap (but very good) regional wines to the expensive Super Tuscans. Our $28 bottle hot the spot and paired nicely with everything. The Cantele was a nice wine that is not your generic Italian table wine., Four us dined here on a Saturday night. The place was packed but service still exceptional. I started with the winter citrus salad which was refreshing and light. It was a large size and consisted of many different lettuce types. Several got the soup, minestrone with hen brodo and lentils that had the most powerful flavorful broth. There weren many lentils though. I focused on the pasta dishes getting 2 half orders since I couldn decide. After eating both, I still couldn say which was better. Both were incredible, authentic, and delicious. I got the cacio e pepe, a roman dish. It is served with burrito here. Ie never seen it served with burrata in Italy and can say it added or subtracted from the dish. I also got the ravioli which was amazing. The half orders are a decent size but if you want leftovers for lunch the next day, get full orders. Others got the fish, which was good but I think pasta is the way to go here. They are the real deal. We ordered several desserts which were devoured too fast to rate., Especially since you charge for bread please do not burn it. The pieces came out significanlty charred not toasted. The portions that were not burned were tasty.The bald waiter could care less. The gnocchi was overcooked as was the other pasta dishes. Very disappointing. A combination of poor service and unremarkable food., This place is fantastic. I came here for happy hour drinks which quickly turned into a light dinner. The ambiance is sexy, sophisticated and warm. The music is light and lovely with sprinkles of Ella, Nina, Frank and cool jazz. The wine offerings were great and the food... oh the food was incredible. Their cheese and prosciutto plate was superb along with the pesto chicken sandwiches. This is exactly the type of place where you can come unwind with friends or someone special. You will leave happy!!, Nice spacious contemporary room with efficient and knowledgeable service.Very good food; fresh; nicely spiced, well presented; flavorful.Reasonable prices for the quality delivered.Worth a visit; and a repeat., Im already a huge fan of Fiola, it does seem that everything Fabio touches tastes delicious. I am here to tell you that Casa Luca is no exception.Lets start with the space, it is beautiful as well as comfortable, the staff is friendly, knowledgable and they have great recommendations. My husband and I had a wonderful dinner there after a long work day. It was easy to make reservations (Open Table), easy to find and easy to park, at least when we went.The food was fan-freaking-tastic! From cocktails through dessert, the charcuterie alone made me a happy woman for the night and everything else was icing on the cake. If you havent been - go! I can not wait to go back and try out their brunch. Did I mention, the suckling pig is amazing!, Casa Luca is a phenomenal find and may be my new favorite Italian restaurant. (It is much more affordable than Fiola.) Casual atmosphere, great food, fresh home made pasta, a notable wine list and the best service around. Superb cocktail list set things in motion. An appetizer of smooth Italian Cheese, with rhubarb and pistachios were the perfect start. The salad of fresh spring garden vegetables was divine. The home made pastas were simply prepared and bursting with flavors. The grilled branzino was the most succulent I have ever tasted. Finally the dessert was magnifico. Our waiter, (from Guatemala) knew the menu and his wines and guided us expertly through the selections. Overall a wonderful experience over tasty food and wine. Bravo Favio Trabucci on another great culinary experience., The service really put this experience over the top for me. My friend has a lot of allergy issues and the server was so patient and went above and beyond to address those issues. He also made amazing wine suggestions and gave us a couple of free glasses after someone accidentally threw out our quarter full bottle.The food was great too. We got the antipasto platter to start which had a little of a lot of the appetizers. Everything was great, but the meat and cheese really stood out. For my entree, I got the puttanesca. It was the perfect portion (not huge, not tiny) and everything was very fresh and delicious. I also tried a bite of the affogato, which I wasnt a huge fan of (Ive had better), but it was a good attempt. All in all, a great experience., This place was amazing! Some friends and I went to dine there after a long day, and they immediately sat us down brought water and our menus. Our waiter, Jose was incredible. Very attentive and gave us a brief description of the menu. I ordered a pork chop which had sausage... Let me just say it was delicious. Accompanied with a Fiera Rosa cocktail, strong for me but did a great job! I would recommend this place for whoever visits D.C.!, SMOKED POTATO GNOCCHI OR GO HOME.Polenta (when they have it) is AMAZING. Meatballs OMG.Prosciutto is nice to start with! Cant beat the $28 bottles of wine. Management is superb. Beautiful decor. Fabio is obviously a rockstar.Have also been for brunch and its the cities best kept secret brunch. Would definitely recommend to bring a big party for brunch - or trying to impress parents in town., Dined here on our last night in DC. Excellent way to end the trip.Service started off a bit spotty, mainly because there seemed to be confusion over who wnedour table. But once that was straightened out, everything was fantastic.Opening small bite of a cheesey rhubarb-strawberry-asparagus thing (fancy word i know) was delicious.Spring veggie sald...deliciousHomemade pasta with asparagus...deliciousPerfectly sized and prepared filet mignon...delicious.Crazy espresso chocloate ice cream thing (that we split!)...deliciousEmbience is cute. Fun to sit in the main room with the bar. Service is spot on, friendly, approachable., I went to Casa Luca for a birthday lunch with much anticipation, as Fiola is my favorite DC restaurant. Unfortunately, the service just didnt live up to the amazing wait staff Ive had at Fiola. Our waiter was very pleasant but completely overwhelmed, as he had entirely too many tables. I had to flag him down just to place our order. We ordered three appetizers to share: Bruschetta with Herbed Ricotta and Asparagus, Maine Lobster with Artichokes and Smoked Farro and the Antipasto Misto platter. All of the food was delicious as expected, but there were similarities between the dishes that made it seem like we were eating the same things over and over. For example, the antipasto platter is served with grilled crostini, so it was very similar to the bruschetta. The antipasto misto platter came with a farro and asparagus salad, and we already had farro in the lobster dish and asparagus on the bruschetta. I definitely think it would have been better if the waiter had mentioned what comes with the antipasto platter so we wouldnt have duplicated food items throughout the three dishes we shared.I asked if the smoked gnocchi with duck ragu was available during lunch. The waiter said hed check, and then he proceeded to forget. He remembered about the sixth time he passed by our table, and someone came by to let us know it was not available for lunch. After so much bread with the appetizers, my dining partner and I decided to share the filet mignon entree. After a lengthy time, they brought us a steak salad. It looked delicious but wasnt what we ordered. So, then we had to wait even longer. Please note that at this point, our lunch was well over an hour long with only having had appetizers. They finally brought out the filet mignon, and I was very disappointed to see that they did not split the order into two servings. I have shared entrees at Fiola two times, and we are always impressed with the way they serve the shared dishes on individual plates. Disappointment aside, the filet mignon was the star of the entire meal - it literally melted in my mouth.On Open Table, I had indicated we were there to celebrate a 40th birthday. At Fiola, I did the same, and we got complimentary dessert. At Casa Luca, we didnt even get offered the dessert menu. It wasnt until I had paid the bill that I felt panicked over the fact I hadnt even ordered a birthday dessert for my friends birthday lunch. Now, Im NOT looking for any freebies, but just pointing out that this was completely opposite of my previous experience at Fiola for the exact same occasion (a birthday lunch)., I went with a large party. Service was great, food was great. Decore is beautiful.Try the monkfish - DELICIOUS - before you google it and see what it looks like :), We dined at Casa Luca the last day in DC. The pasta was so delicious! We will definitely come back to this place when we are in DC the next time., Ive been here three times so far and each time has been amazing. My go to pasta is the fusilli, which is pasta with black pepper and burrata and it is delicious! You can get half or entree portions, and the half portion is more than enough if you are getting an appetizer or sharing one of their meat or fish platters or entrees. I have had both the fish platter and meat platter, which include many different types of fish/meat, and is ordered to share. Both were great and tasted really fresh. They have wonderful bottles of wine there that are affordable as well. The best part is the price of the meal. It is very affordable for how much good Italian food you are getting. This place is a winner., Ive eaten here about 5 times and enjoyed a consistent, delicious meal every time. The fusilli is SO tasty, we usually order a half portion every time we dine here. Ive had several other pastas, most of which were delicious. Their winter citrus salad was my favorite restaurant salad and Im sad its currently off the menu, though I do appreciate their seasonal rotations. The rosemary filet is a great beef dish and I also like the branzino. Desserts are also very good. Affordable wine. The service is warm, and the noise isnt overbearing- you can actually talk to your companions. The reasons to love this place are endless., I took my boyfriend out to eat here last night, and everything was fantastic.We got three cheeses that came with this thick honey to drizzle over the cheese and hearty slices of bread and the beef tartar to start and was pretty filling. the beef tartar was AMAZING, a big portion as well.For our entrees, we got half portions of the smoked gnocchi and the squid ink pasta (which ive always wanted to try) and we werent disappointed. the duck ragu was flavorful and smoky, and the pasta had a great chew to it that only handmade pasta could have. We were going to order more, but those portions actually had us pretty filled.Our server was extremely sweet, despite the rude table who sat next to us. When we ordered dessert, the luca macadonia, they brought out a candle for my boyfriends birthday, which I didnt expect. the dessert had seasonal, fresh fruit and the gelato was excellent.Also, prices werent as high as I thought itd be. Our server actually brought out complimentary lemon cellos for us that i absolutely loved and really really appreciated! I wasnt sure if that was part of the usual service, but the cello was amazing and cleansed our pallets., Fantastico! :) Not only the food was great, but the service was excellent! :)Great appetizers, great entree, and delicious cava and oh the desserts! Is to die for! :)I got a feeling...this place will also be my hang out after work! :)Great job Ilyssius, Amy and the rest of the crew! :) Thumbs up! :), Really could not have been better. Delicious drinks and exquisitely prepared food. I will be back., I want to like Casa Luca, I really do. However, I have now dined there three times and each time I end up leaving bitterly disappointed. The last time I was there, we waited for over thirty minutes before we were finally seated, despite having a reservation. Clearly, the restaurant overbooked itself for that night -- a mistake I could forgive if the restaurant was brand new, but its this lack of judgement that I would expect a 1-year-old establishment would be actively working to avoid. Additionally, given the quality of the food, their prices are way too high; $22 for a small plate of ravioli doesnt jive with me., I recently came off a 21 day diet and the restaurant remains awesome. The seafood dish was awesome! Lindsay continues to be a great host and sommelier who genuinely cares about the customer experience! The Brass Rail rocks. :), Italian is never my go to genre of food. But Id recommend Casa Luca without reservation! Not literally, since Im sure reservations are a good idea here.The chef at Casa Luca named the restaurant after his son, Luca, who won MasterChef season 4. Yes, that adorable Italian accented man who cooked with his heart instead of his brain. Apparently Luca was there being interviewed as I walked in, but I completely missed it! Probably a good thing, since it would have been embarrassing to have my screaming excitement and attack for a selfie together recorded on camera.We had a private room and enjoyed a four course tasting with wine pairings. One of the best Italian meals Ive ever had. First came cheeses with meats- there were Wagyu beef jerky like spices, a wonderful fatty savoury salami, and an amazing prosciutto that was meatier versus thin and had a lingering sweetness to accompany the salt.For antipasti nearly everyone ordered the caprese salad with burrata, which came highly recommended and did not disappoint. The tomatoes were small and roasted into sweet softness, with the burrata cheese webbing its soft form across the plate and delicious sauce with basil leaves to bring it all together. Yummiest caprese salad of my life! Totally unsuspected textures with the tomato not being simple raw cross sections and the burrata cheese.For the pasta course we had a simple burrata cheese and black pepper pasta. The pasta was slightly more al dente than my personal taste, but it all came together in a wonderful mild, simple bite.Next I had the fish, branzino al forno. Flaky white fish with a perfectly crisped savoury skin, on top red peppers, capers, herb sauce. Love the caper fish herb combo and how it tasted melded with the sweetness of the red pepper.Lastly for dessert I went the lighter non chocolate route, devouring every molecule of a strawberry topped vanilla panna cotta. Super smooth with just a hint of vanilla to pair with the small sweetened strawberries, panna cotta not overly sweet. Im drooling as I finish my review! Ace service and elegant Italian flavors without adding unnecessary frills just to be fancy. Yummy! Next time I will properly track down Luca!, Againn was cooler and when they closed shop and this place moved in they didnt do a huge renovation except to take out the scotch lockers. Anyways, the food was good - I had the duck ragu. The plate was a bit small though so Ieft hungry. Hard to imagine at an Italian restaurant. Also, they have me beef not duck. Wasnt bold enough to call hem out on it, but with such a big menu Im not surprised that they would switch things out. It was still good but really???? Drinks were good though but not mixed very strong. Would definitely go back for the drinks - well priced wine too. Bottom line - this place is business focused and it seems that they keep the food just good enough to make you happy but not enthused. Same goes for their other places, Fiola and Fiola Mar. Recommend you try it, but dont come in with high expectations., Absolutely HORRIBLE ... and with capital letters. The pasta was hard (not al dente but actually hard and inedible) and the meat was more like rubber that had no taste .... I would not eat here again even if they paid me to do so ..., It was good service and food. Nice outdoor patio. Close to hotel. Our wait or was friendly and recommended a great bottle of white wine., Stopped by last night for some late-ish night eats. The weather was stupendous so we sat outside. The patio was super cute and the chairs had surprisingly comfortable cushions on them and there was sufficient foot traffic for some decent people watching.Started with a beef tartare and a prosciutto dish. The beef tartare was very generous in size with four mondo slices of bread. The taste was above average. It was large enough that I would not recommend it unless there are four diners, as it could ruin your appetite for the main course. The peach with prosciutto and apple cider dressing was also above average. The prosciutto and the peaches were quite tasty but they were both slightly over sauced.The pasta was great. It really shined through and the sauce/flavoring was exceptional. The duck ragu gnocchi was excellent. The gnocchi, as the server explained, is not traditional style, it was very light and almost fluffy. The duck ragu really complimented it well. It was a rich and flavorful dish. I took some home and it was actually better the next day. The traditional bolognese pappardelle was excellent. I tried it after the gnocchi and it almost seemed a little bland compared to the bold flavors in the gnocchi dish but after a few bites realized that it was excellently prepared and actually the stand out. The nuances of the flavoring were really quite perfect and the pasta was cooked to a perfect consistency. The wine list was quite comprehensive and offered a lot of different wines at different price points. Wine is offered in a glass, carafe, or bottle.I had to take one star away. It took almost 25 minutes to be greeted after being seated. I sat down hangry and needed sustenance stat before I hulk smashed someone. It usually takes me at least a good ten minutes to decide my drink and food selections when I visit a restaurant for the first time... and that is if Im completely focused. I had quite thoroughly reviewed the entire menu, wine menu, Yelp listings, and Yelp photos and still had to wait at least another fifteen before orders were taken, however, I must say service was friendly and knowledgeable from there. Despite the lag at the beginning, I will definitely return here. If the weather permits, I really would recommend sitting on the patio, its lovely. Fabio did another great job with this more casual restaurant!
12|casolare-ristorante-bar-washington|Casolare is a new restaurant in Glover Park by Chef Michael Schlow. They had their grand opening earlier this week, so the hubs and I were excited to check them out for dinner. Just note that theyre only serving dinner now, and other meals will be added to the schedule soon. Located inside the Glover Park Hotel (look for the white brick building with the black design facing Wisconsin).The menu offers lighter Italian fare dishes with an emphasis on seafood. Antipasti includes items such as Barely Seared Tuna, Creamy Burrata, Clams & Mussels, etc.; Pastas include items such as Fettuccine, Ravioli, Tagliatelle, Maltagliati, etc.; Pizzas are available in Margherita/Marinara/Bianca-style; and, entrees revolve around seafood and meat, such as Slow Cooked Salmon, Branzino, Porchetta, Lamb, etc. The hubs and I started off with some Antipastas: Shrimp (with lemon, chiles, and toasted bread crumbs - this was a super bland dish, even with the mixture of the ingredients; the chiles were the ones with the most flavor, but it didnt seem to be enough with the shrimp that was given; also, the shrimp was slightly overcooked) and Grilled Octopus (with small sliced potatoes, scallion, and lemon - this was a tangy dish, and I liked the small sliced potatoes with the nicely tender octopus; it didnt really have a grilled taste to them, but it was still tasty). For the entrees, we shared the Orecchiette (with roasted cauliflower, chiles, grana, and crispy bread crumbs - this tasted exactly the same as the Shrimp Antipasta dish, but it had slightly more flavor due to the addition of grana cheese; the pasta was slightly overcooked and still bland); the Seared Scallops (with roasted zucchini, small potatoes, capers, and lemon - the sauce tasted exactly the same as the one used for the Grilled Octopus Antipasta dish; the scallops were slightly undercooked and could have had more of a sear; I really enjoyed the small whole potatoes the most ,as it had this nice fresh roasted flavor to it); and, a Spicy Chicken Al Diavolo (three large chicken that is roasted with a nice crispy skin, topped with chili oil and smashed potatoes - the chicken, while juicy, was bland; the skin had all of the flavor that had the chili oil on it; I did like the smashed potatoes, as they were bite-sized and had the skin-on). Complimentary bread was given, but it was served cold and had a chewy-texture; however, the bread itself was very soft and a bowl of good olive oil was given. For drinks, we shared a Blood Orange mocktail, which was okay - blood orange juice with club soda.We were both, honestly, a bit disappointed, as we thought each of the dishes would have more of a unique and more of a distinct taste in the sauces and the seasonings that were used; however, to see that a certain Antipasta dish tasting exactly like a certain main entree dish, and another set was another repeat of of a different type of sauce, it was just a little surprising. The price points were also higher, so if each dish was delicious in its own right, it would have been totally fine; however, it seemed as if we had doubles of it all! Also, if you like parsley, youll be a fan, as they give you mounds on top, rather than garnishes. Id still like to check them out when they start serving lunch/brunch to see how the menu compares.The restaurant decor seems to be a modern take on country French, with the cute blue-esque tiles on the walls and the rustic wooden tables; I also loved the artwork! We were seated in a small table with some velvet-like chairs - very cute, but a bit of a tight squeeze and slightly uncomfortable as the table was right up against the wall, and there wasnt room to back-up your chair (another wall). If you want a bit more of a room to breathe, request one of the wooden tables and the chairs.Reservations are accepted, and the staff were super welcoming and nice! There is also a nice bar area, where patrons seem to be having a great time, ordering drinks and some antipasta dishes to share. Valet parking is available.+Grilled Octopus+small oven roasted potatoes+bite-sized smashed potatoes+located inside the Glover Park Hotel; has its own separate entrance+reservations accepted+no dress code!+bathroom in the hotel lobby+free restricted parking on Davis and valet offered, Casolare officially opened on Monday and Im already a repeat customer! The food is amazing the service is on point! What more can you ask?!? Ive been waiting patiently for Casolares arrival. I love my Glover Park neighborhood, but GP is limited to somewhat quick eat spots. So Casolare is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. On both my visits I was pleasantly greeted by hostesses, servers, bartenders, and managers at various points in my visit. All excited to be in the neighborhood and excited to not only see the guests from the Glover Park Kimpton hotel where Casolare resides, but the. Eighborhood locals as well. It was pretty evident that Michael Schlow and management had properly prepared their staff for the opening. Lets get to the good part. The food and drink. I never order roasted chicken when I go to restaurants but somehow on BOTH nights we ended up with the roasted chicken. One night with spice and one without. Im all about consistency! The chicken was well prepared each time and delicious. Crispy juicy roasted chicken with broccolini and these absolutely amazing teeny little white potatos and have been roasted and smashed into little melt in your yumminess! We also ordered the margarita pizza and the wide noodle pasta with lump crab and a wonderful light tomato sauce. The pizza had a thin crust...exactly the way I like it with the right amount of cheese and sauce. The pasta was just as fabulous as everything else. The wine list as Casolare is pretty extensive with a nice selection of by the glass wines and few specialities cocktails. My favs so far are the Big Night Cocktail, the Lambrusco, and the rose. Unfortunately I cant remember the names. I would highly recommend Casolare to anyone and everyone!!! My one teeny recommendation...get the hotel Kimpton To lower their prices on parking for the restaurant. $15 is pretty highly for the location. I know its in a hotel but ...Im just saying., Food was very good, servers worked hard. Only issue was my legs didnt fit in the seat that they sat us in next to the wall. Im only 63. But besides that our experience was great!, We went to Casolare for the first time tonight. The decor is lovely and it has a nice atmosphere. I ordered the arugula salad and Bronzino. Both dishes were exceptional and the flavors were wonderful. We will definitely return to this restaurant and tell our friends about it!, Overall, loved this place. We sat at the bar and tried three appetizers - grilled octopus, the buratta, and chilled seafood salad. All were delicious and were brought out quickly. The service was also excellent. We were greeted the moment we walked in and both bartenders were friendly and fun. There were a couple little hiccups but for a place that opened two weeks ago, I was really impressed. Cant wait to go back!, Had a wonderful meal here shortly after it opened. The staff was very attentive and helpful in describing various dishes and matching suggestions to our expressed preferences. Our party of four shared a booth, which is always welcome alternative to too-close tables when goal is to have a conversation. Actually the space is quite large and tables everywhere seemed to be enjoying conversations. We all had various specials which change frequently, but all were delicious. As you might expect from coastal Italian billing, seafood here is exquisitely prepared. Only complaint: valet parking is not connected to the restaurant; rather it is operated by hotel in which restaurant is located and $15 seems like a stiff price to pay in this neck if the woods. If you can, park on the surrounding streets., Fantastic food with fresh ingredients. I enjoyed everything that we ate. The service was also very good. I would definitely return when I am in the DC area. Great experience, This meal we had was fabulous. We started with a Negroni ,another cocktail with blood orange juice,vodka,prosecco,lemon,and honey, and a third drink made with grappa,lemon,and mint. A shrimp appetizer with Sicilian chilies,lemon,bread crumbs, and fresh parsley was light and perfectly seasoned. A pasta tossed with fresh crabmeat,chiles,and fresh tomatoes was served alongside a preparation of seared swordfish with caponata. The all Italian wine list offers something for everyone. The wine by the glass offering is one of the best I have seen . Our server was professional,enthusiastic,and extremely engaged. If I lived locally,I would eat here once a week, Best food Ive had while visiting DC! Friendly service and beautifully decorated! We received many compliments from the chef so it was great getting to try everything. We ordered the scallops, octopus and the pizza. Octopus was definitely my favorite!, A foodie friend from Charleston was visiting DC and staying at the Kimpton hotel, so we decided to give it a try for drinks and appetizers. Granted, it hasn been open long, so I was expecting some hiccups. The service was friendly and prompt, it seemed like everyone was really trying to be on top of their game. For cocktails, we all got a round of The Big Night, which was made with blood orange juice so it had a nice tangy sweetness to it. I would 100% order this again!For the food, we ordered the roasted red peppers con alice, which stated that they came with red onion, extra virgin olive oil, and basil. I guess it was my fault for not speaking Italian and realizing that alice means anchovies. I felt really bad picking them off, but was also a little disappointed that that wasn something that was stipulated in the menu (this might be a problem especially for someone thinking that this dish was vegetarian/vegan friendly, which it is decidedly not).The Mama Zecca Eggplant was probably the standout favorite of the night. It basically an appetizer portion of eggplant parmigiana, served in an adorable little cast iron skillet. Their red sauce is fantastic! All around a winning dish!Another favorite was the shrimp with lemon, chiles, and toasted breadcrumbs. The shrimp were wonderfully buttery and I loved the complement of the lemon sauce. Definitely recommend this!Our final dish was the grilled octopus, which was very disappointing. The dish was served lukewarm and with undercooked potatoes and overcooked octopus (I not sure how that possible). If I came back, I would try some of the pastas, as this seems to be where they really excel., The meal started off well, but turned salty. The eggplant appetizer was incredible! Delicious layers of eggplant and parmesan, wonderful tomato sauce - oh man! A little salty, but it was fine.Then came the pastas. My bf enjoyed his maltagliata, but my orecchiette was so salty that I had to send it back! I can tolerate salt, but this was inedible. I rarely get to the point of sending it back, but I told our server to try it, which she did in the back, and yeah, even she agreed. So I continued with the chicken alla diavola, which was heavy on the salt, too, but it was good. The potatoes accompanying it were really good.The place was nice to take the pasta off the bill and give us probably the best cannolis Ive ever had for dessert, but it was just so disappointing to have to deal with the salt throughout the meal., I doubt Il be returning. The appetizers were decent. We had the grilled octopus and the shrimp. If not for those, I give 1 star. I guess I might be willing to eat those and have a drink at the bar. But the entrees were gross. We had the maltagliati and the fedelini. Both were basically a bowl of oil with mushy noodles and sauce that tasted like ... oil. Somehow, the bowl-of-oil problem is not unique to Casolare but actually occurs fairly frequently in DC. Why? Yes, olive oil is a staple ingredient in Italian cooking. That doesn mean food should be saturated in it. A bowl of pasta should never have a pool of oil at the bottom. There is *no* sauce for which that is appropriate, not even a bowl of aglio e olio - a sauce that consists of, yes, garlic and oil. The oil in that sauce is emulsified. When you make pasta, *apportion* the oil and *cook* the oil. You don just dump it on and pronounce it authentic, let alone good. We pointed out the oil to the waiter but he didn seem to give a crap.On the bright side, the prices for the pasta were at least not egregious, like they are at so many places in DC. The pistachio semifreddo was decent., For a new place, Casolare was packed! Once we sat down, I had a blood orange cocktail that was very refreshing on a hot summer day. We ordered the buffalo mozzarella appetizer, the potato ravioli, the grilled fish, the chocolate dessert and semifreddo. We ask had their seasonal salad and grilled bread w/ really fresh olive oil, as well. If youe looking for a nice, casual, Italian eatery on a weeknight, try this place out. This is by no means a first-date type of place because youe going to want to lick your plate clean!, This place is only open for dinner unlike the other places in the immediate area. This evening I ordered a glass of wine (Motepulciano), 3-pieces of Zeca, and Maltagliati. Only the wine and the 3-pieces of Zeca showed up. After waiting a long time, when the Maltagliati did not show up. I just paid the bill and left. I will not return. Goodbye., In a hotel so I wore a jacket. Nadine was already there, she is an old Italy hand. Ordered the blood orange drink. I would have served in ice- but what do I know. I would have liked ice, but Casolare is not an ice joint. Not in water either. Afraid it would be politically incorrect to mention it, there could be people dying in ice mines somewhere. In Washington you never know. Ordered eggplant dish everyone seems so excited about. It was awesome. Burrata spectacular. They seemed a little stingy with the bread, more bread would be like asking for more ice I think. Ordered Maltagliata; Wifey had seared scallops. Nadine had potato ravioli; everybody was very happy, my dish had a lot of crab-it was spicy delicious. Cannoli perfect. No problem finding parking after 6:30 pm in Saturday when meters open up. Service was very agreeable. Jacket or no jacket, no one would care- didnt feel stuffy and wait staff was casual. On way out it occurred to me would be fun to eat at the bar. Made me sorry I moved to Maryland, didnt feel it was over-priced; about $130 for all three of us. About right or better than right for DC.
13|cedar-washington|I absolutely loved my dinner last night at the brand new Cedar Restaurant in Penn Quarter. The decor there is amazing. The walls are covered with photographs of cedars peeking through wood slats (I can only assume the wood is cedar). It gives you the feeling of being in a beautiful, airy log cabin in the middle of the forestThe service was fantastic, very attentive and knowledgeable about the cuisine.The food was truly excellent. I particularly recommend the tuna. It was perfectly cooked and paired with incredibly well-flavored sauces. Their carrot cake was also delicious, and I dont normally like carrot cake.A little random, but I feel the need to point out that the bathroom smelled really good . . . like a cedar chest. As soon as the word gets out, Im sure this restaurant is going to be very difficult to get a reservation at., I went to Cedar last night after it was featured on Daily Candy and I was not impressed. The decor did not match the price point and the servers were overly attentive hovering around to the point of it being distracting. The food was good, but I dont think I will return...too many other great restaurants close by., I really loved my dining experience at Cedar. I have gone back twice in the last week or so. I have tried NY steak with tomato jam, Wild Quail, Ahi, and the chicken so far. All were quite tasty and well presented. As for appetizers, I think the presentation of the green pea soup was quite exceptional. The strong green hue of the soup made my eating experience that much better. I also tasted the pan seared oysters and fava bean salad as well. All of the dishes were quite well prepared and perfectly seasoned. I get the sense from my dining experience that the chef has given great thought not only to the taste of these dishes but making it visually pleasing as well. I liked the expression of creativity very much. I capped off my meals with the best carrot cake that Ive ever tasted along with the most decadent brownie that Ive had in recent times. Cedar also has a very refreshing mango sorbet that I really liked. Overall, my dining experience at Cedar has been a refreshing change in an overly mundane dining scene in DC. I am looking forward to going back soon., I went to Cedar a few weeks ago and had a good meal. I had a few split appetizers with my friends and they were all quite tasty. I had the pea soup that was quite flavorful and interesting. The flan had the ability to change the flavor profile of the soup as it disolved and was incoprorated. I had the chicken for my main course and that was quite delicious. I wrapped it up with a delicious bowl of sorbet. It was overall a great meal and look forward to going back soon. Cedars bar looked pretty nice as well, so I will try to stop in for drinks shortly as well., A hidden gem in the heart of Downtown, DC.My instinct is to yelp to you that this place sucks so that I can secretly keep it all to myself, but the BANANA NUT FRENCH TOAST was truly amazing and it would be really mean for me to keep it a secret. I am a brunch kind of lady. This venue was spot on for a great brunch destination: amazing food, good and attentive service (maybe because it new), good decor, and REALLY good prices (it cost me $24 - including tip - for my meal which included a side dish, fresh-squeezed juice and a coffee!)The decor was nice, and if youe lucky, you can find parking on the street within a two-block radius (free on Sundays!). Outside of Sunday brunch, I recommend skipping the car.The place was rather small and intimate and I really like that feel, so I also recommend that this would be good for a date or a group event. Everything (including the coffee and side dish) was top-notch, so I can imagine that the dinner menu would be anything but delicious., I will disagree with other DC reviewers on Cedar. My complaint is not necessarily about the food however - - so keep that in mind. The location is great but the atmosphere felt very much like a hotel restaurant (and not the good kind). The staff was overly anxious, they played Musak and it was stuffy/humid until we asked for a bit more A/C. All that being said, the menu is great and so is the wine list. Id go again to see if I came on a bad night. The bean soup is tasty and my tuna was presented very well!, Date Visited: Tuesday, June 16, 2009Time of Day: LunchI went to Cedar in celebration of a co-worker birthday. Cedar is literally two doors down from our office building so the convenience factor is a plus. The decor put me in the frame of mind of a cheesy (wallpaper of what I assume were cedar trees) yet somewhat modern (vertical wooden slats) log cabin. Being a bona-fide city girl, I didn think it was that great but I sure someone likes it. The atmosphere left me a little confused because with the modern log cabin decor they made a bold if not slightly insane decision to play New Orleans style jazz throughout the restaurant. There weren too many vegetarian options so I had the pea soup and tea because the A/C, in my opinion, was on full blast. I not really a fan of pea soup but as I said, not many veggie options and I was cold. So when they brought my soup out, I was immediately sad because I realized there was bacon in it. The server put down a bowl in front of me with chopped bacon and a small garlic flan. There was a brief moment of confusion and before I could even ask Where the soup? another server came from the other side and poured the soup over the flan and bacon. Presentation-wise, that deserves some kudos. The soup was decent but I had a few issues. I have always been weird about textures and have never been a fan of flan. My flan never quite dissolved into my soup so while it gave some flavor, I had many awkward chunks to maneuver, especially since I was already maneuvering around the chopped bacon. I had some of my coworkers fries which were great but let be honest, how wrong can you go with fries. The birthday boy got a slice of carrot cake and my other coworker and I decided to help ourselves to a forkful. The carrot cake was marvelous and I never order carrot cake because I have had so many bad ones in the past that I am completely turned off to it. So to recap: food was meh, ambiance was eclectic, service was decent, and the dessert won the gold star of the day. I think I will have to try this place for dinner because I have a sneaky suspicion that their dinner is a little better. Maybe then I will be able to add a star to my review., Probably more like a 3.75.I came on a Monday for lunch with 3 coworkers. The decor is interesting - it actually smells like cedar when you walk in. The restaurant is in the basement, but it didnt feel too dark or gloomy, thankfully. Im not a fan of exposed piping and wish that the new buildings would stop with that. But otherwise, I thought the atmosphere was fine. Except it is really loud (a factor I will again blame on exposed piping).Three of us got the burger, which was delicious. I love burgers, and get sad when theyre too dry or overcooked. I asked for mine medium rare, and it was probably closer to medium, but still moist and flavorful! Came with a side of fries. They were well done, but nothing special. I like that the menu was small. You have about 10 options, and no appetizers or anything else to worry about. The price was reasonable - about $75 for the four of us including tax and tip. Its definitely a good option for a more reasonably priced sit-down meal., We really, really liked this place.The decor is very nice, the service was fantastic and the food even better. We had several specials, so it probably wont be terribly helpful to list them, but they were excellent. We did have the tuna, which is a regular dish, and it was very, very good. Usually, restaurants in DC have low quality tuna. Not here - it was beautiful. Further, the wine list and bar are excellent.Long story short, there is something very warm and inviting about the place, the people and the food., My big complaint about Cedar is the decor. Theyve taken the woodland theme a bit too far. The restaurant is wrapped in a forest themed wallpaper which is, in itself, cheesy, but when combined with the log cabin exposed wood and piping details it becomes overwhelming.The food is very good, although, there is not much selection at lunch. The wine list is extensive but is better suited for dinner.All in all, good food and great wine if you can get beyond the decor!, I had dinner and brunch at Cedar during the past week and loved every bite! The crab and white corn soup was AMAZING , as were the fava bean salad, the seared ahi, the gorgeous multi-layered carrot cake and the list goes on and on. No detail was overlooked, even the coffee beans sourced from a small roaster in Brooklyn...this place is seriously cool. The decor is stylish, too, and the tables felt very private. We ordered cocktails and they were great (ask for the Red Burro (sp?)). This is a really special find and I cant wait to go back because everything on the menu looked delicious - next time, I am getting the BLT and chocolate praline bar, which my friend ordered and loved., I have not had a full sit-down meal at Cedar, so let me be the first to review as a bonafide barfly. First things first. Matty P. is one of the best bartenders in this great town of ours. He is super creative with his drinks and is a true mixologist. Im not one to venture far from my beloved vodka soda and he got me to try several concoctions and they were truly delicious. While its quite the trendy drink these days, the sweet tea vodka and lemonade drink he makes - The John Daly - is just delicious - and dangerous. Sweet enough that you forget you are consuming alcohol, so you need to keep track! Matt also makes the best margaritas. And he is a great bartender who makes anyone sitting at the bar feel like a friend.Now, as one that likes to belly up to the bar, I will tell you that a good bar menu is key for sustenance. Cedar doesnt have the most extensive selection on their bar menu, but for what it lacks in quantity, it gains in QUALITY. The Crispy Risotto Balls are delish. And do I have to even say anything more about the Duck Fat Fried Potatoes with Bernaise Sauce. Seriously? OMG. (Yes, I know.. not healthy but if Im eating AT the bar, bring it!! And bring it they did. The fries are incredible). And the best part about all the scrumptious nibbles of fried heaven? They are $6 dollars each, which is already a good price. But you can go bargain shopping on the bar menu and either order 3 for $15 or 5 for $20. We sampled everything and split $20 for food between 3 of us. Cha-ching!!I will definitely go back ALL THE TIME and at some point Ill have to try all the delicious items on the menu. I think the decor is cool and while at first I was hesitant to be hanging out in a basement, its such a great modern atmosphere that you almost forget!Check it out for yourself!, I went here for dinner recently, and the place has a lot of potential. Its new, so there are some little problems they havent nailed down yet (like table placement, our was practically in the entrance). Its a well themed restaurant, you walk down a flight of stairs to this cozy place which is nice. The wine selection is pretty good too, and the food was solid, with some pretty good fish options. Once it gets over some opening bumps, this will be a great place for a cozy dinner in Penn Quarter., cocktail drinks are delish. i had a gin cooler (hendricks, lime and mint)-- almost like a mojito. of course they also had mojitos, as well as berry-inspired drinks. all cocktails are about $9. entrees were a bit pricey ($25 average). highly recommend the wild mushroom stuffed quail. and it true that the carrot layer cake is awesome. very moist and yummy!, Went to Cedar for brunch the day I officially moved out of DC, and have to say, it was a great ending to the DC chapter of my life. Its pretty new, so it was pretty empty, but I had no problem with that. I had an omlette, which was really good, although I must say I could easily have split it with someone because it was obviously full of butter (probably why it tasted so good). But the thing that really made me happy was the Bloody Mary (oops, I mean the two Bloody Marys, because one just wasnt enough). I love Bloody Marys and this was one of the best Ive had in a long time. I would definitely venture back to Cedar next time Im in DC - hopefully Ill get to check out their dinner menu at some point too., Came here on Friday for dinner/drinks with friends. I was a little skeptical about the whole thing after looking at the menu online (Im a weird, picky eater). I started off with some drinks (ok, several drinks)... I stuck mainly with the John Daly at first, which was magical, but was lead astray by a delicious bottle of KungFu Girl riesling that was recommended to us by Matthew the bar manager. Foodwise, we started with appetizers. We had the lemon wings, crispy risotto bites, duck fat fried potatoes, marinated olives, and the pork belly BLTs. Out of these I tried the wings, risotto bites and the duck fat fried potatoes. The potatoes were definitely my favorite by far. They just tasted like amazing french fries. They were well seasoned, crispy and, dare I say it? Orgasmic!!! For dinner, I had the burger off the bar menu with white cheddar. It was cooked perfectly and came with a side of fries. Overall I was very pleased with my dining/drinking experience. Definitely check them out if you are in the area!!, Listening to folks on Penn Quarter Living rave about this chef skills I must admit that my expectations were high going in...but when we were done it left me wondering if this place will survive. The dining room is interesting...small and compact with a very interesting layout leaves you feeling like you are on top of your neighboring tables...if you are hoping to have a discreet conversation this is not the place for this.The menu...interesting mix of dishes and I settled on a crab soup and a pork belly BLT...when the soup arrived it was hot and poured on the spot but the waiter did not seem to think a spoon was necessary and by the time I figured out that he was not coming back my soup was cold (but still pretty good)...but that was the highlight.Food arrived in a strange, staggered fashion (lunch companions got sides and other things...I got my entree) with no explanation from the server. Server disappeared for most of the meal and that would be fine but one of my lunchmates was waiting on her food.My porkbelly sandwich was eeeeehhh at best...the flavors were overwhelming leaving the whole sandwich almost impossible to finish (though I was starving).All-in-all this place will not survive...sorry but I suggest passing., Uh oh. Urbana Joe has competition for my very favorite bartender in all of DC. Now that Michael H introduced me to Matty, the man behind the magic here, my drinking options in the District proper have grown by 50%.Having just been to The Gibson earlier this week, I was prepared to enjoy my beverages here, but even with all the hype that was lavished upon Matty, I figured it wouldn be -that- impressive. Well, I officially wowed.If youe followed any of my annals of alcoholism, youe probably already quite familiar with my distaste for sugary, sweet drinks. And I totally get off on the old school sippables.The first drink that caught my eye when glancing over the menu was an on-menu off-menu selection: Cocktail No. 9, the bartender drink of choice. I knew I found a winner when the sole direction I offered Matty was nothing sweet. What he crafted me was -exactly- my style, something with a rye base alcohol and B39n39dictine - what I figured to be a modified Manhattan upon first sip. Delightfully smooth and perfectly balanced, I think I drained the whole glass in five minutes. And that was just the beginning to the next three hours of continuous imbibing, with Matty crafting up cocktail after cocktail, some I loved and some I just liked, but all were superbly concocted.As Jen G already covered in great detail, the bar menu has some items that are entirely worth ordering - do not miss out on the duck fat fries here. One might think that heavy, crispy, savory, deep fried potato product would be disgustingly over-the-top with a B39arnaise sauce, right? Wrong! I could have demolished the plate by myself, but I glad I didn. The crispy risotto balls rival the deliciousness of Chef Todd version over at Equinox. And although we sampled a few of the items on the dinner menu, I can recall them distinctly enough to recommend them or not. Yeah, it was -that- kind of night.Even on a Friday evening during prime dinner hours, the joint was never packed. Pleasantly full and buzzing, but with plenty of seating. I chalk it up to the fact that it still relatively new and folks haven discovered how great the bar situation is here. But for all that Ie explored the mixology scene in the DMV, I have to say that Cedar is most definitely in the top five bars I willingly frequent based on this singular experience and I sure to return, friends in tow., I went for lunch a few weeks ago with some coworkers. The meal was alright, nothing special. What I take issue with is the service. Our server was easily confused and we were never offered refills on our beverages. I understand these things happen every once in a while, but I really had a problem with what happened next. When it came time for the check, I noticed we were charged less than what we were supposed to be charged. Being honest, I brought this to his attention. I was charged $34.90 instead of the $64.00 I was supposed to be charged. The server told me hed take care of it and then presented me with the $64.00 check. When I checked my credit card account on line a few days later, I noticed two charges-one for $34.90 and one for $64.00. After three days of calling the restaurant, someone finally got back to me and told me they would take care of the problem. I went to the restaurant to present hem with my credit card so that they could refund the $34.90. The GM told me hed take care of it. After checking my account again a few days later, I noticed he only credited me $34.00. I know it is only $0.90, but I have a problem with the back and forth I had to endure to find out I still wasnt credited the proper amount. After leaving 2 more messages about the $0.90, I gave up. In exchange for their not crediting me $0.90 cents and for my trouble, I am writing this review., A great find in the Penn Quarter!! This place is great. I stopped in for lunch and was greeted by a very friendly and warm staff. I had the lobster roll which was out of this world, truly cape style. I was really impressed with the coffee that I had after lunch. They are using a company called Dallis Coffee out of Queens NY. The coffee is served table side in a coffee press. I chose the Yirgacheffe and is was awsome., The service was horrible. At one point a lady from another table came over to our table to grab some sugar since even she had been waiting for over 20 minutes.Other than that the food was actually pretty good. My boyfriend and I went for brunch; I ordered the chicken hash and he got the steak and eggs. Both were delicious and perfect portions. Overall the food was tasty, but the service was questionable.... I would give them another chance though because I sure every place can have an off day., Sure it a basement, but a classy one: It dark in a mysterious and romantic way, not at all like a CSI crime scene or whatever you think of when you hear dark basement.I very much enjoyed the beet salad tasty medley of flavors and textures: crunchy pecans, sweet pickled figs, fresh light-as-a-feather greens, hearty roasted beets, and a creamy goat cheese fondue along the edges. The menu featured only one vegetarian entree (and if youe vegan, you might be out of luck). Good thing it was delicious. This mushroom-lentil concoction, plus a poached egg, was topped with arugula and various other greens. Though the menu listed mushrooms as the first ingredient, I thought the lentils were the star. They were seasoned beautifully and cooked perfectly. My only complaint is that the plate was too small - I wanted more! (Though to be honest, I coulde easily eaten several pounds of those addictive lentils). My husband also enjoyed his braised lamb.When I made the reservation, I had mentioned it would be our anniversary. At the end of our meal, the very nice manager surprised us with a congratulations and free champagne cocktails! Awesome!, Woohoo for brunch at Cedar! The chicken hash is so delicious. The bloody marys are top top top notch. And the dining room is so warm and cozy and nice. Plus the service could not be better. Many people have talked about Matty and he is indeed a huge favorite of mine. Great with the on-the-spot cocktail inventions. Friendly, attentive (both behind the bar and waiting tables) -- hes just great. The owner is so nice, too. Im also a huge fan of the bar menu. Duck fat fries anyone? And the burgers....well, there arent words. I almost dont want to rave too much about this place because Id hate to see it overrun, but its just so terrific I want it to do well., Growing up squash was relegated to the undesirable category with liver and brussels sprouts. They were slimy and soupy and just down right unappealing. Well that has changed.Andy Kitko, the executive chef at Cedar, is a genius. He makes a butternut squash soup that is complex but subtle. Its sweet, smoky and creamy but not heavy. There is an apple-wood bacon and apple combination that just balances the flavors perfectly.The meal doesnt stop there. The pork tenderloin was perfectly done with a spicy crust paired to a sweet cherry sauce. The pork sat upon a bed of savory greens. Like the soup the pork was perfectly balanced.I have said before that a 5-star restaurant makes me want to try dessert. I have changed my mind. Anyone who can make me enjoy squash should be nominated for the Nobel Prize. I love this place. I have gone at least four times and always been pleasantly surprised. Enjoy!, So, Ive now eaten here twice. And, both times, it has been spectacular.First was dinner a few Saturday nights OK. Matty mixed up some nice pre-dinner drinks. had the raosted pork loin with cheeries and greens. YUM! Yesterday, stopped in for brunch. Banana bread French toast. Id be headed back, if I didnt live 2500 miles away.It is down some steps, but well worth the trip. The staff is very friendly, efficient, and classy., Cedar is a great addition to the neighborhood. Delicious food, wonderfully warm staff, and great atmosphere. Believe it or not, the basement setup is a tremendous plus. The close quarters make the restaurant very cozy and intimate. Weve been to Cedar for brunch and dinner a couple of times. We really like to just drop in and sit at the bar. The bartenders are very friendly, and the ever-changing cocktail list has some interesting treats. Both the pork tenderloin and filet mignon were perfectly cooked. Id also recommend the beet salad (with roasted pecans and cherries!) and the Virginia oyster pan roast. The latter is served in a reduction that the ma3etre d swore took 24 hours to prepare., There is no better way to do lunch in style than sipping on a delicious, Hawaiian inspired, champagne, bubbly concoction while its 30 degrees outside.We asked for something festive, and that is what we received. Just my second time at Cedar, and another tasty and unique beverage to hit a homerun with me. Never a dull moment!We started with the Grilled Day Boat Scallops with parsnip-brown butter puree w/truffle scented honey. Although a bit salty for my taste, the scallops were huge, well cooked and nicely presented. The Grilled Jumbo Prawns with warm smoked fingerling potato salad and saffron aioli was my favorite. Flavorful and fresh, every bite was enjoyable. We also split a cheeseburger. Good thing we split it because that bad boy was a big boy! The bun was perfect, and seemed as though it was baked with a light egg glaze. Top the meal off with warm, fabulous, engaging and charismatic staff and your dining experience is delightfully complete., What a wonderful find! I choose it based on other Yelpers and it really was great. Being in the basement, its super cozy and comfortable, and not in the way where youre bumping elbows with everyone else. The wait staff was superb, including the bus boys too. Really attentive and friendly. Perhaps the bread could have come out a little sooner, but we were enjoying cocktails (mine was the Red Orchid!) and chatting away. It was a great location for my girl friends and I to be able to hear each other, while at the same time, allowing us to have a great time.And the FOOD! Butternut Squash soup with bacon and apples - really divine. And the pork tenderloin was just perfect. Im not usually a fan of spinach, but the way it was cooked with the pork was really delicious. I cleaned my plate!I will go back - perhaps to try happy hour at the bar or brunch on the weekends., After having really horrible service at another restaurant, I was happy to have found this place. The decor is really nice. The entire resturant is designed to make you feel like you are dining in a forest. There is a lot of wood panelling and nature scenes throughout. The staff were very professional and really nice. My co-worker is a really picky eater. However, the staff bent over backwards to ensure that they could prepare a meal to her standards. I had the lobster roll with the spicy cole slaw and fries. Yum! They also make this amazing mocktail with ginger beer and blackberry puree. I would highly recommend Cedars as a great place to have a classy lunch., The location...awesome and even though the restuarant is located in a basement setting, I loved the ambiance. Though very small, it was intimate and cozy and my husband and I and our two good friends all agreed that it was a great place.We enjoyed the 4-course pre-fixe meal for New Years. The choices were delightful and the presentation of each dish a delight. Loved the scallop appetizer and everyone raved over the amazing dessert!!I do have to say that although the bartender was the best (came by our table to talk about a wine that we truly enjoyed), the waitress that we had appeared to be not so happy about working on New Years Eve. We added the wine pairing to our meals, but the wine was never served until well after the course had been delivered to our table, she forgot the bread altogether and had failed to refill our coffees. We will absolutely go back again and hope for better service the next time. Really want to see what the regular menu offers, as everything on the menu for New Years was wonderful!!, I walked past this restaurant about a dozen times, and always dismissed it. Let face it - the name and the tree-inspired decor isn, well, inspiring.One night my husband and I were planning a trip to the movies at Gallery Place and Open Table told us that everything close was booked. So, we begrudgingly decided to go to Cedar.Inside, I still thought the atmosphere sucked. But, then they brought me my scallop appetizer, and I forgot about the tree wallpaper. It was gorgeous, and probably the best-prepared scallop Ie had in the District. For my entree, I had the guinea hen, which was amazing. Let me not leave out the dessert - it was an apple almond cake with sour apple sorbet. I was a little hesitant to order it (sour apple could be good or it could smack of Jolly Rancher). It was, without a doubt, the best dessert I have had in DC. (If you like marzipan - order it!!)I wish I could give five stars, but the atmosphere is still lame. The food though... The food!, Katies Restaurant Week Winter 2010 Report CardDining Companion(s): Brendan F. (incidently ran into Venu N. at the bar)1st Course: Butternut Squash Soup with roasted apples, bacon and amaretti. This was probably my favorite course of the night. Really rich and savory. The bacon dust at the bottom of the bowl really seasoned and brought the salt factor (in a good way) of the dish up.2nd Course: Herb Crusted Pork Tenderloin with goat cheese grits, roasted cherries, Creole mustard jus. The pork medalions were cooked to perfection, and the grits were creamy and the goat cheese really shined. Dessert: Chocolate Praline Crunch Bar with with candied orange and gianduja ice cream. Not what I was expecting, it was more of a chocolate moose bar, but still very tasty. Presentation on this dish was lovely. Drinks: This bar serves up some mean cocktails, and there was an extensive wine list. But no sign of beer, so I felt like I shouldnt ask. Service: Really good. Not only was our server knowledgeable, but others checked in on us through the night to make sure we didnt need anything. Atmosphere: For a subterranean venue this place was nicely done. My PIC didnt care for the photographic trees along the walls as much as I did, but with a name like Cedar, there should be trees.Value: This place did RW right., It the end of Restaurant Week, so all the DC foodies are running around, hoping to fit in one more lovely prix fixe dinner. The best friend and I decided to check out Cedar, and we were surprised many times over, but not disappointed.We made our way downstairs past the strange artificial trees to find the tiniest dining room - maybe 25 tables. The place didn feel at all cramped, but warm and intimate, even despite the strange forest wallpaper and nature-inspired artwork.We arrived a few minutes early to grab a cocktail at the bar and grab a few recommendations from Matty, the illustrious bartender. Once seated, we were treated to excellent service by our waitress who was sure to not interrupt conversation. Always a plus.Onto the food - first course: He had the butternut squash soup, I had the fennel, gorgonzola, and pear, and pomegranate salad. The soup was a stunner - savory, complex, and well complemented by the tart roasted apple and bacon garnish. This was one of our favorites of the evening. The salad was tart, crisp, and not over-dressed. We kept exclaiming, Refreshing! after each bite.Second course: He had the herb crusted pork tenderloin, I had the cold smoked salmon. The pork was lovely - not overcooked, the crust gave a nice hint of salt. Served with creamy goat cheese grits, tart roasted cherries, and a smooth mustard jus. But really, the salmon stole the show for me. Rich and flavorful, the sauces were perfect, and the braised cabbage served as a great contrast - a little briny and tangy to lighten up the dish. I make salmon all the time, and this is how I dream it will turn out.Third course: Dessert is usually an afterthought when you just devoured such a great entree, but not here. He had the coconut tres leches cake, and I had the carrot cake. The tres leches cake was dense like a custard and the sorbet served alongside was the perfect counterpoint. My friend thought the passion fruit sauce was too cloyingly sweet, but I disagree. And the carrot cake - a dessert I love although it typically super dense and oily with icing that makes your teeth ache. But not at Cedar - the cake was light and airy, and the dense cream cheese frosting was barely sweetened. The caramel pecan ice cream was of no consequence to me - the cake stole the show.Cedar did Restaurant Week the way it should be done. Did we enjoy ourselves? Immensely. Will we return? Without a doubt., My friend and I took advantage of Cedars pre-theatre menu last month. When we arrived and throughout the entire night, the host and wait staff were incredibly polite, helpful, and knowledgeable. The waitress even found a better wine for me when she thought I wouldnt like the one I ordered...AWESOME!!The restaurant is tucked away down some stairs and its walls are covered with a nice cedar tree print giving it a very cozy and intimate feel. Though I came with a coworker, the place would also be ideal for a date or lunch with your Mama (you know she deserves it). For our meals, I started out with the butternut squash soup and the friend ordered the salad. Both were tasty, but I think I enjoyed my taste of her salad more than my soup. Then again, I often question whether I like that type of soup anyway (my mistake not Cedars). For my main course, I chose salmon with braised cabbage and potato cakes in a light cream sauce. The potatoes could have used a bit more salt, but other than that, the dish was beautiful and delicious. Judging from her clean plate, my coworker thought her beef tenderloin was all right too. We each chose the carrot cake with ginger ice cream as our dessert. It came out with multiple layers of cream cheese frosting and decaf french press coffee for me. It hit the spot perfectly as did their brewed coffee.Cedars menu is short and their pre-fixe menu is even shorter, but with quality choices for every course, Cedar is a warm and comforting antidote to bitterly cold winter weather., Count me another member of the Matty the Bartender fan club. I had the pleasure of joining some other yelpers... and non yelpers (it was an unofficial unofficial uye) for an evening gathering in honor of the great Im Han K and I think we were all pretty blown away by the service, the delicious cocktails and interesting array of food.I didnt actually eat an entree, so perhaps that discounts the credibility of my stars here, BUT... I did eat duck fat fries. and nibbly bites of the salmon dish and duck dish. and heaping bites of the carrot cake and sour apple sorbet with butter cake desserts.That sour apple sorbet was something else. It was like eating a cold pulverized granny smith apple with candied walnuts and caramel sauce underneath. Put it all together and whattya get - caramel apple! The butter cake it came with was pretty yummy too... it was a BUTTER cake, after all. The carrot cake was also quite good, with the lovely surprising oomph from the crispy curly strings of carrots placed on top.I have to confess I wasnt nuts about the fries. I mean they were good fries... but something spectacular and mind-blowing? not so much. It was mostly like eating normal somewhat-thick fries with the unexpected aftertaste of meat. It wasnt gross or great. Just... interesting.The cocktails were fun. Besides the fact that the ones on the menu were clearly inventive, I liked that there was an option for the bartenders choice -- a chance to surprise the daring customer. Im Han ordered this and ended up with a delicious sweet champagne concoction. I cant remember the name of the drink I ordered but it had something to do with blackberry and something to do with honey. And it was quite delicious for my sweet and fruity tastes. But even if you dont like the sweet and fruity stuff, Cedars still got you covered with high-quality, high-tasting booze. (see Michael H)Another note on the spectacular service: My husband and I arrived later than others, but they were happy to bring another table and pull up some chairs. For a really classy restaurant, they acted really classy about doing this. Throughout our time there, Matty was marvelous as well, mixing the right amount of friendly banter with the right amount of efficiency and professionalism. Lastly, he happily split the check for us without a complaint.... the true cherry on top.I am very eager to try the restaurant again for an actual round meal., If you think steak and onions, pork and grits, smoked salmon and cabbage, and chicken with tomato sauce sound like innovative and sumptuous dishes, then this is the place for you. Said dishes were the ONLY entree options for restaurant week. My appetizer of butternut squash soup was decent. Another member of my party ordered the oyster pan roast (actually a stew?!). Upon tasting the oyster pan roast I was filled with regret from not ordering it for myself, it was sublime. I found no single entree option appealing. I chose the pork loin dish, as it seemed to have the most direction out of the entrees. I was disappointed with the bland pork rolled in salted pine needles. I enjoyed the two roasted cherries that sat beside the pork, so I suppose it wasn all bad, and after glancing at my neighbor chicken wing in tomato sauce I was thankful that I didn order that. The highlight of my meal was surely the dessert. The pineapple sorbet that accompanied my tres leches cake was delightful, my one wish would be that there was more than a teaspoon of it on my plate. As for service... After being without water for ten minutes, I eventually caught the attention of our waitress. Her response to my request for a water refill was, can I get you a cocktail ?. I replied with a no thank you, just the water for now, and waited another ten minutes before walking to the bar for my water refill. Bread had to be requested after twenty-five minutes, and no refills were given for that either. It would have been nice to eat the bread with my soup. The man working at the coat check, who also distributed some of our dishes, was very friendly and charming. The decor is certainly of less importance, but Cedar wins no points in that arena either., Very classy and at the same time relaxed and comfortable. The staff is amazing to say the least- so friendly and engaging and we had a wonderful conversation about my favorite topic.. wait for it... food. The bartender is truly dedicated and makes his drinks with such care, he has mastered the art of mixology. He also super witty. Tara L ordered the cocktail Number 9 drink which is the bartenders choice but i hear it always amazing.. her drink was superb. I had a glass of riesling, i wasn feeling too adventurous. The food! We ate at the bar the bar nibblets served in portions of 1, 2, or 3 options. We got the lemon-grilled chicken wings- delicious, light, definitely if you like chicken youl love this! Tara swore by the duck fat fried fries which were served with a great aoli and had a hint of duck. What i loved about them is that they were hearty sized fries and still crispy on the outside and the slight taste of duck was unexpectedly delightful! If youe not a duck fan i wouldn order it though because I could see how some may be put off by it if they aren keen on duck.Last but certainly not least were the risotto cakes which had lemon zest and creme fraiche inside and then were breaded and deep fried/ They were amazing. Normally i am wary of risotto because it is either too soft or too hard and if it is cooked properly then it sauce is too rich. However these were perfect. Biting in to the risotto cake there was a delightful crunch and then there is a short burst of lemon (not overpowering) and then it rolls out in to a creamy hint of cheesiness--- kudos to the chef. Also just a few examples of how wonderful the service is:I entered from the blistering cold snowstorm frozen and hungry and even though their kitchen was not open they took my food order anyway also I don get reception and I dropped my phone-call with my mom and they let me use the restaurant phone to call her back. I happy I discovered Cedar and I will surely be back for some more risotto cakes and to try a cocktail #9!, I went here for the first time during restaurant week. First, the I love the intimacy of the place and the decor is unlike anything Ive seen in the DC area. I sat at the bar while waiting for my friends; the tiny bar is proportional to the small intimate restaurant, but the bartender was friendly. If I lived or worked nearby, I could see myself spending more time at their bar. All four of us loved the food and the service was impeccable. Very romantic place to take a date!, The morning after the first snowstorm of the year, my sister and I ventured out for brunch. I knew Cedar was a relatively new addition to the neighborhood, but I didn know anyone who had actually been there. So we braved the snow and were rewarded by great service and a good, hearty brunch. I echo what everyone said about the service - it was the perfect level of attentiveness. They took our snow-covered jackets and got us a large pot of coffee right away. We started with a plate of fresh baked banana bread, and quickly filled up with two incredibly hearty meals - the pork belly BLT (richest sandwich ever) and the smoked salmon benedict. The dishes were a little too rich for the occasion, but that was our gluttonous mistake. But the reason I have reservations about Cedar is because the space seemed a little claustrophobic to me. I don *need* ambiance (for example, despite Tosca completely unremarkable decor I go there for dinner in a heartbeat), but Cedar is a basement restaurant without windows (lots of mirrors though) and I could sense that while we were eating. It a little different at the bar, which I would still go back to try, where the ceiling is raised. And reading reviews about dinner, I definitely want to go back and try the real food. But that feeling made an impression on me, and might keep me from highly recommending the place, depending on what I try next., I figure its about time I wrote a review for Cedar, I have been three times for drinks, one lunch, and one dinner. First off, the drinks. Matty and the other bartenders are fantastic. Great suggestions, original drinks, and conversation. The Gin coolers are amazing. Lunch is good, but dinner is better. Long story short, solid, simple preparations, with enough inventiveness to make it really worth your while. I had the herb crusted pork which was cooked well, and paired with a fantastic pinot that Matty recommended. The space itself has a great feel, small, but not too small. I really appreciate when staff members of restaurants are helpful, and the wait staff have great advice about food, wine, etc., Wow. Great homemade Bloody Marys with habanero and jalapeno infused vodka! Not for the faint of heart but wow does it taste great on a cold winter morning below street level in this cozy little spot. (Note: If you are not a fan of a lot of cracked pepper than this may not be the drink for you). For me, this drink was the showcase for a fantastic braised pork belly sandwich with a fried egg, smoked tomatoes, and basil aioli. The side of mixed greens was unimpressive but it really didnt matter. The drink/BLT combination was perfect and you can never really go wrong with a fried egg and generous amounts of pork belly! It was $22 for the whole shebang which was totally worth it in my book. The ambiance is intimate and modern. The service was outstanding. They were attentive, friendly, knowledgeable, and they seemed very happy to be working there. The caveat is that I have only been once and only for brunch so I cannot speak to the quality and service in truly busy situations. I cant wait to go again!, Had a fantastic business lunch at Cedar. The butternut squash soup was great, I don think I can eat it without bacon now! I had the chicken sausage ragu over pasta for my entree and it was fantastic - not too light, not too heavy. It could be a touch too salty for some, but not me - especially because the salt was from thin slices of pecorino. Three of my colleagues had the BLT of pork belly, tomato compote, and basil aioli and loved it.The decor isn really anything to write home about, but some great prints of cedar line the walls. The service was good to very good., Food delicious. Staff prompt but not intrusive. Yeah its in a basement, but not a big deal bc decor is good and food great., Awesome brunch Sat and Sun starting at 11am. A secret gem! Try the Crab Cake Benedict with the La Vie En Rose champagne cocktail., My husband and I agree - this is possibly the best brunch weve ever had. I got the deviled chicken hash which was superb, with an aroma that was almost as divine as the flavor. It would definitely be a consideration to order again - even though I like trying new dishes with subsequent visits. My hubby got the crab cake Benedict which he raves about to this day. The banana bread was reminiscent of grandmas - and we were bummed we didnt have room for dessert. The portions are generous, even the crab was plentiful. These 5 stars are well-deserved! A must for Washingtonians or visitors!, went for valentines day. i will definitely be back. it was seriously so good. started with a cheese plate - they dont have a wide selection of cheese, and the three they have are all soft...but very good. and the honey and fruit compote was delicious. the bread and butter with salt was also excellent. we also ordered the oyster pan roast appetizer with a salad. the oyster appetizer apparently won an award in the washingtonian...not surprisingly. it was delicious. its this mushroomy delicious broth with leeks. you have to try that one. the scallops appetizer looked awesome too. i ordered the lobster and my b/f got the vegetarian dish. i thought they both were perfect. my b/f, who might be more critical than me, was a little disappointed with the vegetarian meal because he thought it was too much like a salad and not a meal. i gave very little weight to his thoughts because even if there had been some major flaw, the dessert made up for it. we got the chocolate cake. sooo delicious. the coffee was perfect. and the price was very reasonable. i plan to go back again and again and again., I just got back from lunch at Cedar. Nice place, especially for a date. The food was pretty good. My friend had the butternut squash soup and the Market Lettuce Salad. The salad was great but the soup was not so great. I had the Selles Sur Cher Goat Cheese salad, which was excellent. I am not a fan of beets, but somehow, this dish just worked. The warm bread they serve is lovely. They also have some great mocktails. I had the something burro, which was a great mocktail! The bill wasnt bad, about $35 for the both of us. I definitely will come back, but am hoping for some more vegetarian options next time., After going to Cedar, I was inspired to watch The Great Outdoors (big ups to John Candy). No, the restaurant is not a log cabin in Wisconsin, but it does have wood paneling and tree wall paper. Some might find the d39cor a little cheesy, but I do like how cozy the restaurant is and that its not tapas or asian fusion. Sometimes I dont feel like sharing. Sometimes I just want my own plate of food. I also liked that they dont take the theme too far. No bison or venison. Or lumberjacks. I had the cold smoked salmon and my friend had the pork tenderloin. The salmon was tender and nicely charred, the braised cabbage smoky and was complimented by the creamy rich sauce. The potato cake was more of a glorified hashbrown, but whats not to like about hashbrowns? I didnt try the pork but thats partly because my friend devoured it. She doesnt like to share either. The entrees are a little pricier than I expected but I didnt feel hoodwinked. The service was excellent and the drinks were delicious so I kept them coming. Only recently have I begun to appreciate the art of a well crafted cocktail. Maybe years of drinking rum and diets does that to a person. Even if the menu is not really your style, grabbing a few drinks here would do you some good. And so would watching some John Candy movies., So, disclaimer: Ive only had the drinks. But based on these, yeah, Im a believer. Worthy of four stars in this department.We visited for Yelp Drinks Week (which can be tricky - not all places listed were serving the Yelp specials every day of the Drinks Week, nor for all hours, as my roommate unfortunately discovered at PS7s). Sat at the bar, had a fab bartender who answered all our random questions (including re: the shortage of bitters. Right.) and mixed us some deliciously potent libations.I indulged in the White Orchid. Apparently this is the same as the Red Orchid on their menu, just minus the blackberry bits, or whatever. Very good - I went for a second. My boyfriend started with the Gold something or other, basically Makers Mark, lemon and honey, which was also divine.The good smelled good but the menu was pricey and we had Chinese on the mind. Would definitely return for a happy hour, though, assuming they have one..., Had a late reservation on a recent Friday and the place was still pretty busy. It was surprisingly loud for such a small place. The interior is attractive and you kind of forget you are below-ground. Our meal was excellent. I started with grilled day boat scallops served over parsnip puree with truffled honey. The flavor combination was amazing. My salmon entree was cooked perfectly. I tried some of my wifes pork tenderloin and it was amazing too. We were planning on dessert elsewhere, so we skipped that course. The server was friendly, but surprisingly casual and not exceptionally well-informed. Still, we really enjoyed our meal and would go back., Made reservations for a 5:30 dinner on a Saturday before a show at Ford Theatre.My fiance arrived and felt immediately unsure of things as the front door opens to a dimly-lit stairway. We walked down and a hostess offered to take our coats. I reasonably certain we had never been to a place that did that (a more common nice dinner for us is like Rio Grande or Coastal Flats).We were sat in a cozy corner and given the menu, the pre-theatre menu, and the wine list by our server. A gentleman brought us sparkling water and, minutes later, some excellent bread. My fiance ordered the market salad, salmon, and Chocolate Praline Crunch Bar. I ordered the market salad, pork tenderloin, and carrot cake. For drinks, our server recommended the Red Orchid for my fiance. She thought it was good though it had more of a citrus flavor than she expected. I, having read reviews that suggested giving the bartender some freedom in figuring out your drink, requested something like a whiskey sour. I received a Pisco Sour which was fantastic. I had never head of a Pisco Sour. Or Pisco, for that matter.The salads were great - the pomegranate seeds were interesting in a good way. Both entrees arrived and looked very nice. My fiance had the Riesling which was sweet and I had my server recommendation: the Montirius Cote du Rhone. I had never before had something that paired so well with what I was eating.My fiance enjoyed her salmon but didn care for the cabbage it came with. The pork was great and came with mashed potatoes which were much better than the swiss chard the menu said it would come with.The desserts were out of this world. The Chocolate Praline Crunch Bar was a little rich and there was no way we could eat both that and the carrot cake anyway but they both tasted just ridiculously good.$70 for the food, $40 for the drinks, and $11 in tax. Like I said, we don spend that amount on dinner more than once or twice a year but, even so, we definitely be back., We tried this place on a somewhat planned whim before going to game at the Verizon Center. I wish wed had more time to linger and try dessert - our neighbors house-made ice cream and carrot cake looked fantastic.Im glad we asked about the pan roasted oysters because we learned that it was voted one the ten best appetizers in the city. We couldnt pass that up and ordered one to share. When it arrived - oysters stewed in butter, cream and white wine, with thin coins of Jerusalem artichokes and leeks - I took one spoonful and asked my husband if we should order another. Because I didnt want to share.Our main courses were delicious as well. I had perfectly cooked herb crusted pork tenderloin with a cherry glaze and goat cheese polenta...mmmm. My husband had a tender, juicy steak fillet with baby carrots, spinach and a salsify gratin. Were now fans of salsify, especially if theyre a conveyor of melted cheese.The space is cozy, but surprisingly loud for how few tables there are. Once youre ensconced in your booth (if youre lucky), youll forget that youre in a basement., Had a delightful double date here a month or so ago. Pan roasted oyseters got points for flavor and presentation (though I think they surprised my side of the banquet, as they were in a broth of sorts). Loved my dish (the pork), but the real winner was the lobster. Dont bother getting anything else, this dish was the clear winner of the evening.The waitress was pleasant, but didnt seem extremely familiar with the menu, which is fine, because the food was good.Kind of wish this place had natural sunlight/windows, but for a subterranian post, I think theyve made decor lemonade out of underground lemons., First, the good (which has NOTHING to do with the food): The staff was extremely courtious and attentive in general. We had a guest arrive very late and she was able to put her order in right away and all meals came at the same time.THE BAD: I ordered the crab cakes Benedict. However, I asked for simply the crab cakes and the mixed greens. The server even came back to double check that all I wanted was the crab cakes with nothing on top. When my food came out, there were eggs on top of my crab cakes. Once removed, it was discovered that the two crab cakes were little more than the size of a silver dollar and only about 1/8 of an inch thick. They were something that could be consumed in 2 bites by the average person. In addition, they were extremely salty. So basically I paid $14 for 2 salty bites of crab and some lettuce with balsamic on it.My friend was undecided on what to order and was recommended the chicken hash by the server. In her words basically it just sucked! The hash cake was bland, bland, bland...as bland as could be. So basically she paid $12 for something similar to a McDonald hashbrown (but worse,) two eggs that could have been made at home, and some lettuce with balsamic.Overall, we could have puchased the same ingredients at the grocery store and created a much tastier meal for less than half the price!On our way out, we did voice our complaints to the host who said that he had received similar sentiments about the chicken hash that morning. However he offered us no compensation and the only words he could muster were come back and try us again....yeah, I don think so!, Our initial impression after sitting down for a meal at The Cedar restaurant was that it took a long time to place our order. Afterwards, the coffee was not great, it tasted gritty and was brewed too strong. The food was okay, standard breakfast meals that were solidly prepared if a little overpriced. The champagne cocktails were popular with the ladies, but if you share my taste in alcohol, they will probably taste painfully candy-sweet.Overall, nothing to really complain about, everyone pretty much ordered and got what they expected, but no one was really impressed by anything., My partner and I went to Cedar for the first time Saturday night. We wanted to check it out because it was new (at least to us) and in part because it participates in airline mileage dining programs. Overall, we were favorably impressed and I would definitely return and recommend it. Food: I had the butter lettuce salad, duck, and chocolate praline dessert. I thoroughly enjoyed all of them. Especially the duck - perfectly cooked and served with nice sides. My partner had the oysters and then the lobster and carrot cake. He liked his meal especially the lobster. One somewhat unappealing aspect of the food was the 1990s style plating - huge plates with fairly modest portions huddled in the middle. The veggie side for the duck (there was also a starch) was two (2!) green beans and one baby carrot. Nicely done but still... Drinks: They have a good bartender and some nice wines by the glass and large selection of after-dinner drinks. I thought it was a nice touch that when the champagne by the glass I wanted was not available they offered me the upgrade but at the lower price (of the one I ordered). I also appreciated the complimentary mini-cocktail at the end of the meal. Ambiance: I like the location and the vibe, despite it being underground. The decor reminded me a lot of Firefly (in Dupont); I did not really get the cedar theme. Cedar is comfortable, appealing, and pretty quiet. The crowd was diverse including several gay couples, a few older people, and a mixed group at the bar. Nice vibe all around. Value: Cedar is not cheap but I thought it was a decent value. Despite the somewhat small portions, I was satisfied when we left. Service: The service, although not terrible, is the weakest link. There are a lot of people who work at Cedar and not all of them seem experienced or clear on the role they are supposed to play. We had to wait a fairly long period for our water and bread and cocktails and the waitress did not seem to know what the kitchen had on hand. There were also a lot of people who stopped by the table to check on us which is not that bad I guess. We had to wait a long time for the check to pay and then leave., My colleague and I stumbled into Cedar when our normal lunch hangouts were unusually crowded. Its a good thing we did, because Cedar is a hidden gem in the middle of Gallery Place/Penn Quarter.The ambience is understated elegance, with well-situated tables. After we ordered our meals, the server brought us slices of the freshest, most delicious bread (I think it was a boule) -- it was crusty with a soft and yielding center. They served the slices with soft butter and coarse salt that added just the right touch. I ate too many slices of that bread than I would care to admit; it nearly ruined my lunch.For lunch, my friend started with a butternut squash soup that he said was delicious (but I did not try). We then split their high-end version of a BLT (made with fatty pork rather than bacon, tomato compote, and basil aioli). It was decadent and flavorful. The BLT came with the most amazing fries I have ever had in this city. I would return to Cedar just for those fries - they were crisp and golden, with the perfect french fry texture. They also did not get soggy despite our long lunch. We also split their wild mushroom strudel. The wild mushrooms were perfectly seasoned and encased in a filo wrapping. The contrast between the earthy mushrooms and crispy filo was wonderful. That strudel was served with a mixed green salad. We did not have room for dessert, since we practically had to roll ourselves out of there. The food was amazing. I definitely will go back., Cedar has friendly staff, impeccable service and the food is AMAZING. From the burger for lunch (reasonably priced for an upscale place around $12) to the pork tenderloin smothered in cherry sauce, this place never disappoints. Perfect for business lunches, romantic dinners., Had dinner here and thought it was better than brunch, which was pretty good. The dinner menu is inventive and the cocktails are excellent. The bartenders will make drinks to order, or invent something for you. Very knowledgeable staff and a good experience overall., Went for brunch with two others on a Sunday morning. Very positive reviews all around - great burger, great deviled chicken hash, great pork belly BLT (what I had). I stole an idea from another reviewer here and ordered banana bread, asking that it be served as an appetizer but our waiter didnt bring it out until the main course. What attracted us in the first place was the combo of an early opening (10am versus 11:30am for most of the other brunch spots in Penn Quarter) and a chef whose resume includes Gary Danko and Aqua, two wonderful San Francisco restaurants I have visited.Other than the decor (rather nondescript - felt a bit like a hotel restaurant) and the fact that it was underground (we missed out on the beautiful sunny morning above), it was all around a great experience.
14|china-chilcano-washington|Nice fusion. Service was fantastic for opening night but that doesnt surprise me for a Jose Andres Restaurant. Must try tum tum noodles- spicy pork wheat noodles. The chaufa Cubano was delicious. Atmosphere was fun and light. Definitely will return, Night two and incredibly impressed. My wife and I are moderate fans of Jose resturants, as with any resturant empire there are are some hits and misses but this is one of the true winners. China Chilcano set the bar extremely high and the hardest part for the resturant will be keeping it up. Atmosphere is different and cool, with some plywood still showing. One downside is that for such a hip place, the bar is relatively small so it will definitely be three people deep as it becomes popular.Service was good, friendly and well trained, although, pointing out the most popular dish on day two of opening made me laugh, realizing there is a Vegas version of this resturant and maybe it the most popular dish there, or with Jose or in Peru, or when Jose is in Peru. With that said, the servers recommendations were spot on so youl want to take them into account.The food was the true stand out with some amazing dishes. The menu is not posted on their site yet so I don have the names of dishes but things to try include the appetizer with quail egg, the pork belly fried rice that you mix at the table and the shrimp won tons. We are not big dessert people but the shaved desert with custard was fabulous - think the lightest of sorbets that melts into a sweet honey custard bottom - it is so light you use chopsticks to eat it.Overall, highly recommended and definitely check it out., Definitely worth a 5 star review. Went for the second night it was open and while a little busy, the food was on point. The servers were very knowledgeable and had fantastic recommendations. Overall the service was a little rocky, but it opening week so I sure that will improve. There was not guinea pig on the menu when we went, which I was a little disappointed about, but our server reassured us that they would be adding it as soon as they are able to find a consistent supply of quality guinea pig -- though I have no idea where theyl find that... Either way, wel definitely be back once that added to the menu. Finally it worth mentioning that the prices are incredibly reasonable. It done small plate style with a suggested 2-3 plates per person. There were two of us and we got 5, plus an appetizer, and that was more than enough. Each plat is around $15 so in the end our bill was ~$100. Much less than I was expecting for the quality of food!, Food and drinks were excellent. Some hickups in getting our orders out in a timely manner but hey it was night #2. Desserts were somewhat underwhelming and dull considering how vibrant and diverse their dinner menu is. Jos39 himself was in the kitchen last night, hopefully the food will remain at that high level., Take a wild excursion on Peruvian culinary cuisine and food influences.....without having to go to Peru! All in one place, you will find yourself in an energetic environment where Dim Sum, Sashimi, a 300lb seafood-langosta tank, plenty of Pisco....Peruvian styled dishes and sushi a.k.a. causaki all come together to set your taste buds on fire! I had the opportunity to dine at China Chilcano during the restaurant first night of business and soft-opening, thanks to a good PR friend and writer for the Washington Post. From the minute I arrived to the point of leaving, I thoroughly enjoyed the overall experience. Upon arriving, we were greeted by the General Manager, named Mayu Horie. She was an awesome host and represented China Chilcano flawlessly. Before dining, she took us on a tour of the restaurant. At that time, I learned more than I had bargain for regarding Peruvian cuisine and its culture. Unbeknownst to me, Mayu explained that Peru has a large Japanese and Chinese community, which creates a food subculture of Chinese Chifa (Cantonese) and Japanese Nikkei cuisines that naturally intersect with that of South American ingredients! Who knew!? I sure did not. She also went on to explain the restaurant concept and some thrown in secrets to the interior design. I felt like the true C Celebthat I am....being that we were given a personal tour! LOL. Just kidding. Sorry, I digress. Back to the review.THE VIBEThe restaurant is divided into three sections (check out the pics posted):  Heaven--China Chilcano ceviche bar is in the section. There are seats at the ceviche bar where guests can grab a quick meal and small eats. Elements -- A cool section with an industrial feel. Painted red cargo ship steel and white crates hang from the ceiling. Select tables with built-in azy Susansfor easy sharing. Also there a really cool table that was sunken into the floor to evoke the Japanese style of tatami dining. From the table viewpoint, you can see the open kitchen, flaming woks and a marathon of cooks.  Marketplace -- This was my favorite section and the best seats in the house; in my opinion. The ambiance and lighting just takes you there. In this section you can help but notice this really cool mural, on the whole wall, of a mysterious Geisha face disappearing into a floral background (check out the pic). Definitely striking! Even more exciting, as the general manager (Mayu) was describing the piece she went on to point-out and introduce us to the actual artist......who was dining there that night as well! Mad cool....in my book. At this point in the tour, I was sold and eager to get to the grub! THE FOODThe food was outstanding and everything was delicious! I had a chance to sample and try the following:* Ceviche Nikkei -- Super fresh Big-Eye Tuna prepared and blended with soy-cured egg yolk, quinoa, onions, tomatoes, yam and avocado. It tasted very clean, yet lite with explosive flavor.* California Causagiris -- A Peruvian style sushi dish that was outstanding! Really good!! It looks like a sushi maki roll, but instead of rice....raw fish roe & lump crab is served on a platform of pur39ed potato and aji amarillo chilies! * Lomo Salto -- The highlight of the night. Flat Iron Steak cooked and seasoned to perfection. Prepared medium rare and saut39ed in tomato, soy sauce, ginger....topped with shoestring potatoes and served with rice. Heaven...melted in my mouth good!* Concolon -- A Peruvian fried rice dish composed of Pork Belly, sausage, bok choy, mushrooms, onions, & crispy yellow saffron rice topped w/ Pork Skins!! Very tasty!THE DRINKSPisco (Peruvian Brandy) is the name of the game here. They plan to have the biggest Pisco bar selection this side of the east coast the manager mentioned. Although that was impressive, I was not too hyped about the drinks. They were too sweet, weak and not strong enough for my pickled liver. I created my own concoction called a Pineapple Ice Tea Slammer to turn things up. Everyone seemed enjoyed it. So pass the royalties my way Jose Andres...if you decide to add it to the menu. LOLOVERALL EXPERIENCEAs you can tell from such an extensive review, I really enjoyed my night and dining experience at China Chilcanco. The food was delicious! The General Manager -- Mayu Horie gets a Gold Star for providing one of the best dining experiences I have had in a DC restaurant in a long time. In all, 4 1/2 stars. A 1/2 star deduction for frail drinks & service kinks....but that by far does not over shadow the great food, concept, & ambiance of this place. I highly recommend giving China Chilcano a visit. And, I will definitely be a returning foodie...especially when the rumored New Guinea Pig! hits the menu!!, I have a feeling I going to like this place! Maybe not for the main dishes, but for the many varieties of Pisco drinks and small bites I can crush at the sexy/wacky bar! I owe my 2 hour happy hour joy to our bartender Richie (Go Brooklyn) who walked me and my buddy through the drink menu! Classic Pisco Sours, then, every smart variation on the theme there-in (one that invoked an old Fashion), plus Jose Andres turns on other classic cocktails like an old Fashion with Chinese 5 spices, or think of adding star anise to kick up your simple vodka cocktail! Youl see a concerted effort to showcase the fusion of Latin and Chinese flavors, and it succeeds most of the time (the decor is not exactly my style, hence the wacky, but you can beat the splashes of color mixed with the unfinished wood feeling of a beach front shack spitting out fresh seafood!)! We didn see a happy hour special, and it was too early for dinner, so we tried two apps and two drinks!The pineapple infused pisco, mixed into the pisco sour was a hit! Bold pineapple acidity is mellowed by the picso, then, made into a velvety drink by the whipped egg yolk. The Pisco 100, aged in casks to give it a dark bourbon-like quality, also made for a stellar cocktail. Armed with shakers and mini electrified whisks, the bar staff can craft you an egg topped cocktail at top speeds!Food, we opted for the civiched Hamachi in Tiger Milk sauce and large corn. Light, thinly sliced hamachi in a sea of yellow sauce....perfect, not to acidic! The Causagiris (a take on the cake-like potato dish called a Causa, and making it into a sushi like nigiri) topped with jump lump crab and avocado, was a delightful surprise. Perfect for sharing, great balance of salt and umami and the slight crunch of toasted sesamie seeds that coat the bottom!Some drinks and some aps set us back $50, but the high quality of the products made it well worth it. Vibrant and quirky, servers buzzing about on opening day two, and two great culinary worlds to borrow from means China Chilcano has miles to grow and experiment! I look forward to trying more of their menu!!, Preface: Jose Andre was sitting at the table next to me still altering the menu. You can see the difference in my california causagiri from the ones posted a few days ago. Also, my feelings of the place are a bit pretentious since I have servers who are obviously not Asian telling me why a dish is Asian when I am full Chinese (more about that later). Luckily, their food is good.Overall decor was very unique. It definitely looked like a fusion of something. Not sure of chinese, peruvian and japanese though. The left side of the restaurant is very red where the bar is and the right side has more yellow lighting where the sushi bar is. Luckily, I sat on the yellower side because when I went to the left side (red) , I just felt very anxious, which could also be due to there being more people over there since smaller tables are over there and the right side is reserved for larger tables. Very clean place which was not overly crowded and clean bathrooms (it only been open for 4 days. haha)Service: Above and beyond. Almost too much. Our table couldn make our choice on what we wanted because we were trying to decipher the menu. The menu has a lot of Spanish words I have never heard of. I normally have no trouble ordering items in mexican or spanish restaurants. I think the restaurant was trying to create new fusion words to make it seem more unique. The plates were cleared when changing courses along with utensils and water was always kept full almost to the point that it was intrusive. We felt like we were interrupted when water was filled constantly. Not to bash the servers, but it is just habit for me to make eye contact and say thank you when they fill the glass so that interrupts the conversation. Honestly, it is just me complaining that the service was too good. I like a more laidback staff that hangs out at their location and if I look over, they can come over and help. A good suggestion would for them to ask if we would just like our own bottle at the table to fill up the waters on our own.ON TO THE FOOD!So we started off with the chifles which are plantain chips with salsa. Nothing unique about the chips. Very good. The salsa was good. It had good flavor and wasn just a tomato based salsa. It had something sweet to it.We also ordered the ceviche clasico al mar which was very good. I am used to mexican ceviche so this was definitely unique to have sweet potato and what looked like corn nuts in it. It also had some mint in it. The California causagiri was a great take on a california roll. I was expecting imitation crab since that is how it is always made, but it was lump crab which was placed on top with fish eggs on top of a potato cube with avocado inside which was supposed to be the rice portion in a california roll. The potato still gave it a starchy taste, but nice because it was a puree and not in grain form like rice.The lucky 12 siu mai was ordered and i was skeptical about paying 18 dollars for 12 shumai and i was correct. They were tiny and the traditional and beef did not taste that different from ones found at dimsum. If you want to try shumai then try the concha ones. They tasted the most unique with the scallops. These shumai, however, all were very moist and melt in your mouth so the quality was definitely there. Aji de gallina. This was essentially chicken curry. I would not order this. It failed to impress. It didn have a strong curry flavor like indian curry, but it was strong enough to drown out any other flavors that were in the dish. Arroz a la cubana- ORDER IT- The pork belly was a bit softer than i like and would be amazing if it was seared quickly. We mashed the plantain chips that came within this dish inside and it was a nice combination of soft from the roasted whole plantain and crunchy plantain chips. You can never go wrong with adding an egg to a rice dish.Concolon- MUST ORDER! - This dish was amazing. Nothing to change about it except for the description from the server. They bring out the dish in a clay pot and show you the nicely placed meats and vegetables and then you approve of it. Then they prepare it by adding sauce and chicharrones table side. What killed it for me was the description from the server. This dish is crispy rice and the server said this has lap chung ( cantonese for sausage) bok choy, mushrooms, and crispy rice, the stuff that all the kids fight for at the bottom of the pot. In my mind, eating rice for almost every dinner of the first 18 years of my life, never have I ever wanted to eat the crusty burnt rice on the side of the pot. I always avoid the hard rice. It is interesting because I am Chinese and I don fight for the rice at the bottom of the pot like they purport little chinese children to do. I know Korean people eat the burnt rice at the bottom of the stone bowls by adding hot water to loosen it up, but definitely not chinese people. I think y, The food is delicious and unique- but I left paying a lot to leave hungry. This is never the case at any other Jose Andres restaurants in the area. Portion sizes need to be uped for sure- especially dumpling sizes and sushiThe drinks were great. Pisco sour is recommended. All the food that came out was good. Lamb dumplings are recommended for something pan fried and the steamed shrimp dumplings tasted great as well, but fell apart when eating them. Steak, concolon, and the shrimp dishes were the highlights of the meal. For the first week of the new restaurant service was very pleasant but food came out slow and sporadic. Overall worth the try but may want some chips and guac from oyamel before., 3.5 (4 based on food but overall 3.5 for the mediocre service by our waiter and other hiccups).I had great expectations for this place. My boyfriend and I love Jose Andres Think Group and are regulars at his restaurants. We made reservations last tuesday and the only thing available for two people was Saturday at 6:45 p.m. So call ahead!! We arrived and were promptly seated. The restaurant was not full even though there weren any tables available to reserve.The restaurant is beautiful and has a variety of table shapes, bar and booth seating. The lighting is amazing and they play with different industrial elements. We were seated at the sushi bar which seats about five people. We really enjoy watching chefs cook so we thought it was a great seating area. We were greeted by our waiter who explained the menu and left. The Wine list and cocktail list extensive and they have MANY MANY MANY piscos so definitely go with one! We ordered Jose Gin & Tonic and one of the Pisco drinks. They were both REALLY GOOD. If you like Gin & Tonic I will def. recommend theirs! First Round of Food: We started with three plates, the chicken skewer, the traditional ceviche and the aereopuerto rice. They were all really good. The Chicken Skewers come in servings of two (small) and they are perfectly grilled chicken thighs in a spicy rub. The ceviche is a MUST, one of the best ones Ie had. We saw the Sushi masters cut the fish in front of us and the presentation is exquisite! The Aereopuerto rice is also a MUST. Its the best Chinese/inspired rice Ie had. It comes with over 20 baby vegetables; we loved that the rice wasn salty either.We ordered two glasses of wine and went for round two of food! Second Round: Things start to go downhill. We had to wait around 30 minutes after ordering the food for the dishes (an almost 45 minutes for ONE OF THEM). We ordered the California roll, dumplings and the Lomo Saltado. Lomo was a play on the traditional plate (which is one of my favorite peruvian dishes). The steak was perfectly cooked unfortunately we got a steak with a lot of fiber so it was chewy. The Lomo is served with sticky rice which is a fun way to include the Japanese touch. The dumplings were amazing too!Now, the California Roll. We had seen the sushi chefs make it and they put so much labor in it that we wanted to try it. Our waiter took the order an left. We waited and waited and waited and he came and told us our california roll was coming soon. Five minutes later he came and said you guys ordered the California roll right? to what we emphatically replied YES... a few minutes later he came back and told us, okay sorry it wasn showing up, its coming... 15 minutes later he came to ask us if we wanted something else (as if to bring the dessert menu) and my bf told him we were still waiting for the roll to which he said OH SO YOU DID ORDER THE ROLL... at that point we realized he had TOTALLY FORGOTTEN ABOUT PUTTING IT IN the system and we were pretty upset about it... we ended up waiting 45 minutes for a ROLL!!! He was dismissive and treated us like it was OUR mistake. After that I saw him talking to one of the managers and she came to the sushi bar and asked one of the chefs if a California roll was printed. We finally got our roll, however how the waiter treated us left us with a bad taste in our mouths. He wasn apologetic, and made it look like it was our fault when we confirmed THREE times we had ordered the plate. Our dinner was two hours long and we ended up spending around $170 for two people. The food was good but our waiter did not treat us well. 45 minutes for a a $15 sushi roll is insane and even more when the waiter is not apologetic at all! I will go back but will wait a bit for them to figure out which staff members are worth keeping. Our waiter ruined a great culinary experience with his adversarial attitude. As this think group should know, the food is only one part of the experience., Bottom line: I really wanted to love this place, but it was overhyped and overpriced, and I won be back.The Pros: - The space is LOVELY. Divided into numerous sections, the vibrant colors and lighting are gorgeous and over-the-top. - The wait staff were attentive.- The Lomo Saltado was very good - great texture to the meat and great flavor. The Mehs:- Zhen Fe and Seco de Res were both good, but not mind-blowing. For the price, disappointing.- Pisco drinks were good (FYI: the Capitan is basically a pisco manhattan), but overly expensive for what they were ($12-15).The Cons:- Wayyyy overpriced, small portions. Suggested 2-3 plates/person; each plate is around $13-22, and some of the portions are very small (and I don mean fake I-a-fat-American-I-demand-overly-giant-portions-to-be-satisfied small - I mean actually tiny). For example, ceviche at Oyamel is the same price and 2-3x the amount. - The wait staff, while attentive, weren very knowledgeable. They didn quite know the dishes enough to suggest anything; they didn know they were out of the star dish aj3d de gallina (also, who runs out of a main player on week two??); they awkwardly lingered; and overall, they just weren on point.- This is nitpicky but the restrooms were already a wreck, with broken non-closing doors and paper everywhere. Again, not huge, but in the overall, speaks volumes. In the end, for a little over $100, we had three drinks and 4 small plates (including ceviche) and instead of ordering more, we all opted to leave for drinks and Dinner #2 elsewhere. Pretty much sums it up, right?, Ceviche chuloc33n and some other fusion Asian peruvian food. Had a refreshing chilcano beverage to wash it down. Nice ambience with a ceviche bar too., Sounds weird, but it works. Even the duck tongues. Jose Andres has done it again. My only quibble is that the draft beer selection could be better. Great, unique d39cor. The servers were a bit uninformed, but I guess thats to be expected as its still early days., Jose, what happened? I love your other restaurants but the food here is not good. Its a beautiful restaurant, a fun menu, great cocktails but the food---just nothing you would want to order twice. We had fun and ordered lots and lots of different things but a lot of them we just tasted and didnt finish because they were not worth the calories. I never had that experience at jaleo or zaytinia or even Oyamel. In fact, I generally eat everything wherever I go--I have had better dim sum out of a bag of frozen shu mai and while the cerviche was good it was nothing I want to come back for. I am a regular at Jaleo and zaytinia--I think you need to come eat at your new restaurant and fix the food--sorry Jose :(, As much as I want to be a Jose groupie and give China Chilcano 5 starts I just cant. Pros:The decor is fabulous. just look at the photos on their website - its exactly as pictured! This is such a fun spot for date night or a get together with friends. Your conversation will surely thrive on the energy. I love the mural, lights and pillows. The womens bathroom walls are chalkboard and chalk is placed throughout the bathroom. Sounds weird but its fun!Our waiter Stephen was phenomenal. We learned so much about the restaurants overall concept and each dish from him. Thank you, Stephen!Cocktails were a hit too! Cons: We ordered several things but I cant think of anything I ate that I would want to go back and order again. We did like the Lucky 16 Dim Sum and felt this was also great value. One of the dishes described as their heartier dishes, called Tacu Tacu, is $15.00 and its basically an egg with hash brown. It was tasty but I think the prices are really off. 4 dishes, 2 cocktails - $100.00....you be the judge. I think DC foodies might agree with this 3 star review however because on a Saturday night, with an event at the Verizon Center, we walked in at 7:30pm without a reservation and were able to get a table....actually took our pick of a table., Most fun weve ever had! The food was great as usual and the drinks were amazing. You must have the pisco sour or the chilcano. Both hits! Our server, Kayla, was fun and knowledgable so much so that we let her take us through the menu at her whim. She ended our dinner before dessert with the Concolon, and it was everything she said it would be. We dine out often and have been regulars of Jos39s restaurants for years and have never had so much fun with our server. We will go back for the food, the drinks and definitely for our server. Five stars all the way!!, Good food and good service but the prices are a bit high. The Aj3d de Gallina and Suspiro Lime31a were delicious. The Lengua de Pato anticucho was eh. I felt like Jaleos Restaurant Week was a better deal. I left China Chilcano on a relatively empty stomach., My friend and I had reservations for 8:30 during restaurant week. I was really excited to try this place out because I am a fan of Jose Andress other restaurants, but this one fell way short. To start, my friend and I opted for tap water rather than sparkling. Before we get a chance to drink any, a server stops by to tell us that we were served sparkling water and proceeds to serve us tap water. While this may sound like he tried to save us from drinking water we didnt ask for, there was no apology; instead, it was more of a that other guy made a mistake. Okay, thats fine. So now we have four glasses of water on the table. But shortly after someone stops by again to take away the sparkling water which is so very awkward when all the cups of water look exactly the same just sitting there and we try and figure out which cups have the sparkling water. Moving on to the service and food. It took FOREVER for the food to come out. They brought out each course one by one, which didnt make sense considering we did restaurant week, so my friend had to watch me eat my dish and then we would wait a good 20 minutes before her dish would come out. By the time we got to the dessert portion it was maybe 2 hours later and we were informed that they were out of the dessert we selected, which we had ordered at the beginning of our meal. They did at least add one other dessert option to the restaurant week menu. As for the food, it did nothing for me. I found it to be bland in terms of flavor profiles but overly salty. My friend thought the ceviche was okay. Also, we werent the only ones who were unimpressed. The table next to us could be overheard complaining to the server and then the manager about their food being bland and served lukewarm.Pro: The decor was fun and different. I just wish they spent more time on getting the basics right, like the food and customer service. Needless to say I will not be going back., 2.5 stars. Let me start off by saying the food was fantastic. Really flavorful and presented wonderfully. Everyone from the host to the waiter were extremely friendly and capable. Our reservations were for 6:30pm and we got seated right away. The meal went off wonderfully until the kitchen must have experienced a hiccup. This restaurant is small plates, and 6 out of our 8 plates came out about 15 minutes after ordering, which was great. However, it took another 20 minutes for our 7th plate and about 35 for our 8th. By the time we got dessert it was 9pm and my butt had fallen asleep from sitting so long. We didnt leave until about 9:30pm after seeing the dinner rush come and go. Both our waiter and the manager were extremely apologetic and comped one round of our drinks but it was a trying experience. I really wanted to love this place and the food was good, so Ill give it another shot and update my review. Ill chalk this one up to the restaurant only having been open for 2 weeks., I felt like I just filled chef Jose Andres wallet while he didnt fill my stomach in exchange. This restaurant is all about looks, aesthetically delighting presentation, food back story and marketing. I was amazed by the decor, the mural, the Nazca line red lighting, and the pleasant staff who provided great details about the items on the menu. I was less impressed by the items that showed up at our table for us to share. Do not go there without having had a pre-dinner or plans for a second dinner afterwards! If you like going to have nibbles of novel ingredients and spending a lot of money for it, this is the place for you!I leave you with some memorable food tasting notes (because you wont feel like you have actually eaten even though you spend $250 on food):The Ceviche Nikkei was a joke of a portion size at $18, served in a silver dish. It had maybe a quarter of an avocado chopped in over nibbles of tuna in a sweetened soy sauce. Its not enough for one much less two or four. At $18, its ridiculous, because the taste might be good but I could barely remember it, there was just a yearning for more.We were pleased by the fried Yuquitas Rellenas ($9), drizzled in a sugary sauce, because, well, fried food (stuffing winter squash and mushroom) drizzled with syrup is always palatable! We got two portions of this, because it felt like real food.The Octopus-Olive ceviche, while gorgeous feasting to the eye left so much to be desired...could hardly grab enough of the miniscule, thinly-sliced, carpaccio-style octopus tentacles to get a bite in. I mean when you cant really bite your food, its just dissatisfying! We got two portions of this because getting one is a joke. Two at $15 set us back $30.The Camaron Saltado (salted shrimp with wood eared mushroom, $15) came out on the strongly salty side. I love wood eared mushrooms, but I felt this dish was surprisingly poorly balanced for such a master chef creation. In contrast the noodle bowls that we ordered, first the Wantan Especial and second the Chupe de Camaron (soup with heads of shrimp left in it) both had wan, weak broth. The Wantan Especial definitely tasted of Rahmen noodles, though I am sure they must have been something more upmarket. It was very hard to share these broths around the table. They are more suited to single portions but are priced for sharing ($15--$16 each). Had to try the Lomo Saltado ($19). Yes, its great, especially the fried shredded potato! But the portion size was awfully small, even for one person. The best part was the spanish chillis which are included in the dish, charred. The Nobu Usuzukuri (flounder with a Japanese radish, $16) tasted rather off putting. There are pretty red chilis on the plate though! The flounder was wierdly fishy (and our waiter reminded us that this ceviche is not cured in lime for a long time, its freshly prepared. Hence our estimation that it was just...fishy in a raw unpleasant way).The potatoes with yellow pepper sauce (Pappas a la Huancaina y Ocopa, $9) was embellished with quail eggs and really great presentation, leaving me wishing for about a dozen more of the tiny potatoes all for myself and wishing I did not have to share these sparing portions.To wrap up, the desert Suspiro Limena ($8)was quite lovely, with the heavy sugariness of the caramelized condensed milk cut by sharp passion fruit and crunchy meringes.Our drinks: chicha punch ($8) and chilcano ($12) were brilliant but pricey. They are well done and I would maybe go back just for the drinks here. Maaaybe.Ill give it a break because its the first month of opening but the food took forever to show up at our table. Overhyped? Overpriced? Overblown? Yes. Yes. And Yes., I probably give this restaurant a 3.5 based on food/drinks, but the service bumps it up to a 4. The food is pretty good, the drinks could use a bit of work. I am admittedly not really a fan of Jose Andres restaurants, but I was intrigued by the menu here.I met a friend here for dinner on a Wednesday evening around 6:30 and was lucky enough to get a table without a reservation. I wouldn expect for that to happen often though because they said the tables have been booked up every other night since opening. Luckily for me, the weather led to some cancellations. The space is nice, open and full of bright lights. I love the sunken table near the center, next to the window, it is perfect for a semi-large party. Jose Andres was actually dining there himself with a group of people, so service was definitely on point when we went. The waiter was attentive without being overly aggressive and he was also very knowledgeable of not only the food but also the cocktails, which is impressive considering that the restaurant just opened. For drinks, I tried the La Limena (made w. Macchu Pisco, Combier Lriginal, guanabana, vanilla and lemon), the drink was not bad and it wasn too sweet, but it was also full of ice though and could have had a bit (a lot) more alcohol. I felt like the drink was gone in four sips. I also tried the Capitan (made w. sour cherry pisco, vermouth and Amargo Chuncho bitters, except I substituted ginger pisco for sour cherry pisco at the waiter suggestion); this drink was much stronger than the first one and I loved the addition of the ginger to add a little spice to it but the lemon zest was very overpowering. I ended the night with a glass of their Santa Julia Brut Rose sparkling, which was very good and had the perfect amount of sweetness mixed with floral notes. The drinks are typically $11-13.For food, I had the Siu Mai Tradicional, which is pretty much a small round steamed dumpling filled with shrimp, pork, jicama and peanut with a vinegar sauce on the side. I loved those little things! The portion comes with 7, but I probably could have eaten 10 more. They were so good and bursting with flavor. Note: the pollo ones come with a quail egg, although the online menu does not say that. I also got Peru most precious dish, the Aji de Gallina, which is a chicken stew w. white cheese, pecans, quail egg (wasn mentioned on the menu either), potatoes and olives, served with a tiny portion of rice. The menu also did not say anything about olives, so I was more than disappointed to find myself chewing on a big red olive that I thought was a pecan covered in sauce. I hate olives, so I gagged and spit it out immediately. The rest of the time I was eating the dish, I was inspecting it bite by bite to make sure that I didn get any more olives. I wish I had known in advance. The portion of rice that comes with the stew is also very tiny. I think they should give you a little bit more so that you can continue to eat it all together throughout the meal and they could also add a little bit more seasoning to the stew as well since I found it to be a bit bland. I also tried my friend California Causagiris, which is like nigiri sushi with a chunk of potato instead of rice, w. crab, cucumber, avocado, spicy mayo, tobiko and served with a creamy Peruvian yellow sauce; this was very good as well!I was tempted to try the dessert, but I was actually pretty full after all that. I can see this place continuing to be a hot spot. I also must say that I love the bathroom. It is basically covered in wood and chalkboard material (even the inside of the stalls). I got a little excited and probably spent a lot longer in the bathroom than I needed to, writing all types of stuff on the walls. LOL, Really sloooooooooooow. My server was nice but the food came out insanely slow. The food was good but I agree with many of the reviews here that the service needs to improve. Everybody was very friendly but the amoumnt of time it took for things was rediculous. Ill keep my eyes on the reviews and perhaps return im the future., To some this may be an unusual mix, but Peru has a large Chinese community, estimated at almost 5% of the population. Most of the original Chinese came from Macau and were predominantly slaves and laborers; the majority were men. Then they made babies with the locals and there you go. Ok history lesson over, hows the food up in here?Its good. Possibly very good. Its basically small plates, and you will want 2-3 per person. The lighting inside the place is kind of red neon, which Im not the biggest fan of in terms of eating. But interior is very nice for sure. I tried the duck tongue, uni, ceviche Classico, yuquitas rellenas, and aji de gallina. The aji I cant recommend simply because it is very mild flavored. If you eat it after a the other dishes youre going to be disappointed. We got some hot sauce from the lovely waitress and it made it taste much better. Actually, it should be served that way. All the other things we ordered were very good. Ceviche was excellent. Yuquitas were yummy as hell. Definitely worth going to but I cant necessarily say Im dying to eat there again soon. Not sure why. Service is very good and so is food. Who knows why., I was invited by my cousin and I was pleasently surprised by the selections on the menu. I had a tough time deciding what to order so the 3 of us decided to share. I will have to go back to try more. My favorite last night was the Quinoa salad. Loved the smooth and crunchy texture. The decor was appealing as well and the drinks are exquisite.Our serve was also very knowledgeable but I cant recall his name. Oops!, Another tapas restaurant on a street filled with quality tapas restaurants namely SEI and the king and undisputed champion Jaleo! This may be one of my most conflicted reviews yet because everything I had was excellent minus the bland sangria. This restaurant is brand new, in a hot location but it faces a major delimma. How do I stand out or better yet, how do I fit in?? This is one cool place that looks like its been furnished by an upscale Asian Ikea.. Lol. It has beautiful abstract art and lighting throughout which will definitely have you talking. The dishes that we ordered were EXCELLENT in preparation and taste. This chef knows what the hell hes doing! We had the potato based California sushi roll, the NY Strip, the pork belly sandwiches and seasoned chicken skewers. That being said, here goes the number 1,2 and 3 delimma. We ate all of those wonderful dishes, only had one drink each during happy hour time (they have yet to enact a HH here), spent over $100 and left hungry. I know tapas means small but for the price of their meals, this small takes the cake! Each pork belly sandwich was $9, two bites and poof.. Gone!. This thing was tiny, delicious but tiny. You can reiterate that same sentiment for every dish we had. We could have stayed there and spent a small fortune to satisfy our appetite, instead we decided to go next door and give SEI a little of our hard earned money.. Lol I know part of the price includes location, ambiance and excellent customer service. We definitely experienced all three. Ive been eating out long enough to know the game. However, my favorite tapas spot Jaleo is just a few doors away and for that price I have NEVER left hungry!, TAKE HEED!! When the waiter alerts you that it is a small plate place, and says youl want to order 2-3 plates each, be forewarned. You have to be careful...you could order 10 dim sums because they are all amazingly delicious, pay a fortune, and still be hungry. This is not the place to come when youe hungry or on a budget.Now that Ie gotten that out of the way, let me tell you about the food. This place had me when I read it was a Jose Andres restaurant. Kudos to my girl Ylonda for suggesting the Sanguche de Chancho Nipon, which is a scrumptious mini pork belly patty served with a sweet potato cake inside a melt in your mouth buttery toasted bun. The hoisin sauce made all the flavors come together. It was so good, but that amazingness only lasted two small bites. The waiter did alert us to order two, so we could each have one. I could of have had 4, but not for $9 each. Next came our California Causagiris, which the waiter said was the blending of Peruvian causa and Japanese nigiri. The base was potato and avocado and it was topped with lump crab meat and spicy mayo. Again, this dish was delicious but be sure to order your own. Sharing six mini bites just didn quench my appetite. But I knew we ordered more food, so I needed to be patient. The pollo anticuchos were served next, in a huge bowl. Three chunks of marinated barbecue chicken on a stick, inside half of a kettle bell. I couldn dig the presentation, but the chicken melted in my mouth. Very quickly. Poof, it was gone. Waiter, wel take two more of those! Yep, still hungry. Baby portions just don cut it when youe hungry. After scrolling through the pics on Yelp, we agreed to order the Somo Saltado as our last dish, thinking THIS would be filling. Nope, but damn was it delicious! Small bites of strip steak in a soy sauce. Throw some grape tomatoes, onions, slices of bell pepper and shoestring fried potatoes in there to make the bowl look filling. All I kept thinking was if I eat slow, Il get full faster. But why should I think that after having 5 dim sum plates and spending $$$.$$? I was ready for a Shake Shack burger! SmhThe atmosphere was gorgeous. Picture perfect. It was bright and the hints of red (my fav color) and chandeliers brought a sophisticated ambience to the new hip joint on the block. I just don think there will be many second-timers with all the other competition in Penn Quarter, unless you plan to go to dinner afterwards. Yes, I know I greedy., Brings back a the good memories I had in Peru, My husband has a pretty serious seafood allergy. Which we told our waiter as soon as we were seated. He talked to the chef, and came back with a list of things that were absolutely certain were okay (so they said) and my husband stuck to that list. No sharing food or utensils. And as we were walking out, he had an allergic reaction. Tingling lips, swollen tongue, the whole bit. The best we can tell, there was cross contamination in the kitchen-- they the fried in shoestring potatoes served with the steak in the same oil as the seafood. Scary! I know this a new restaurant, but this is a pretty common allergy, and the kitchen said they could handle it. If you are dining with someone with an allergy or someone with special dietary needs, be very, very careful., We had a wonderful experience here on Sunday evening. We were seated promptly at the time of our reservation, our server was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly, and the food was fantastic. There were four of us and we ordered four small starter plates, four more substantial dishes, and two desserts to share. We spent about $40 per person and none of us left hungry. Yes, the prices for some of the individual dishes were a bit expensive, but at a restaurant like this you have to know you are paying for paying for quality and not quantity.The highlights of our meal were the Tacu Tacu braised oxtail, the Aji de Gallina chicken stew, and the Ponderaciones de Kiwicha spiral cookie dessert. All of the flavors, seasonings and textures were spot on and we didnt have a dish that we wouldnt order again., This is an absolutely outstanding Jose Andres restaurant. Its only problem - I think it is too sophisticated for China town area. Had this been a much smaller restaurant tucked in somewhere in Shaw - people would rave about it and come time and again, and pay twice the price for a portion twice as small. Pros: the menu is very complex - but for me thats the beauty of it. I think people come, get confused by a number of choices and ingredients, order something that has at least a familiar name, quickly add items to their bill and leave hungry. You have to study the menu before hand or ask your server about each and every dish - otherwise you will get lost on the third item - I certainly did. I also had one of the most memorable recent dining experiences here. Despite the hype and a long waiting line at the front door, our server was very patient and talked to us about origins of food, her favorites, most ordered items - all while keeping an eye on all tables at her section. We ordered dishes in turn, 1-2 at a time, and every time she would give us feedback - how to pair different things, what we should skip, etc. Both ceviches - Nobu Usuzukuri and Ceviche Nikkei were divine - perfect combination of fresh fish and citrus. Fish was cut to a precision and melted in the mouth. You knew these were just made to order, as after 10-15 minutes some tuna started to overcook. We then had Kam Lu Want31n and Concha Sui Mai - again very flavorful, but more simple dishes. We ended up splitting Sudado de Pescado and that was the highlight of the night - a steamy bag of fish and veggies arriving at your table, being opened right there to release all the aromas. And to top it off - Suspiro Lime31a - the Peruvian classic that I always wanted to try - and a work of art! We ended up around $120 for two (with tax and tip) - but this is a high end dining place unlike more casual sister restaurants up and down the street. I think it was definitely worth it, even though a bit expensive. If you skip pisco sours (at $12 a piece btw) and concentrate on food instead this will be a thrilling experience., Hmm, this was pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised. I thought this was just going to be another Jose Andres Tapas place, added to a crowded street of Jose Andres Tapas places. Usually, I consciously avoid tapas because I hate spending a lot of money on tiny plates of food...But anyway, like I said I was pleasantly surprised. In this corner we have our friend Chinese food: dim sum, wontons, throw some chopsticks on the table. In this other corner we have Peruvian food: Arroz con pollo, Ceviches, throw a fork and spoon on the table. Now put them both under the same roof and these cuisines are single and ready to mingle!What may sound like some fancy new, outrageous fusion concept is actually a thing called Peruvian Chifa. It basically Chinese food heavily influenced by Peruvian cuisine and It been around for a long time and it served in Peru (I didn know this until like...yesterday). First I ordered: Aji de Gallina or spicy chicken stew with potatoes, amarillo peppers, pecans, botija olives, and rice.I was surprised when this dish arrived. It wasn what I envisioned. But then I realized what COULD I have envisioned since my Peruvian cuisine/culture reference point consisted of a visit to Super Pollo and that South Park episode where Stan convinces everyone to start a Peruvian Pan Flute Band (Pandemic- Season 12 Episode 10). Thankfully this dish quickly educated me on the essence of What is Peruvian.It was a very hearty, comforting stew that was mildly spicy with tender chicken. Occasionally a sweet botija olive or a pecan would cut through spiciness of the stew to say Hey look, don forget wee in here too!Next I ordered: Pegao Norteno Lamb Pot sticker, aderezo norteno, cilantro, cumin, crispy lace, winter squash sauce.When this came out it was ALSO not what I expected. I do have a reference point for dim sum but I was imagining some generic, boring Dim Sum served in a steamer basket. But nope, nope that NOT what I got. This was dim sum with expert presentation and attention to detail. The pot stickers were arranged in a circle on the plate and the crispy lace gently laid on top like a delicate veil. It even had some gold leaf sprinkled on it. So pretty! insert starry eyes The winter squash sauce was painted on the plate...hey it starting to look like something. OH it a FLOWER. AWESOME. Yeah, I had to take a picture of it....Not only did it look amazing, it also tasted amazing...super juicy pot sticker + crispy lace = yay I definitely recommend you take a trip here and let Peruvian Chifa cuisine boggle your mind., Im sorry. I was very disappointed . I went during lunch time . It took forever to get the food like 40 minutes . Further , they did not have two dishes that we wanted to eat . Over price ., Every single dish we had was amazing, and they were all vegetarian. Try the quinoa, the veggie dumplings, the handmade noodles with garlic, the mushroom skewers, and their condensed milk dessert with meringue and passion fruit sorbet..I think. One of the best meals in DC so far!!!, Great food and great drinks! Richie is the best bartender there! He is super nice and always helpful. The plates are small, but its a great place to buy a few plates and share with friends., Go craving nothing in particular. The food was all around good. Great service., 3.5 stars. I wasn expecting tapas, and I think they still have some kinks in that some of their food is awkward to share. We tried the Chupe de Camaron (head-on shrimp broth). I always get shrimp heads when I can find them and love to suck out the contents. Alas, I was disappointed to find them empty. The Lomo Saltado was good, though a bit overdone for prime strip. The anticuchos (pollo) was tremendous, but one skewer is $5.00. Unfortunately, it was a measly skewer so we were all disappointed with the amount to price ratio (note: I pay A LOT of money for food, so this isn about me being cheap). Minibar and other Jose Andres places don phase me, but I did think they were pushing it here. The cocktails were fresh (no mixes). That always wins points with me.The best thing we ate was the Lucky Dim Sum platter. The dumplings are very small, but they pack a huge flavor punch (see: I not as cheap as you think I am). The Dorado was on the salty side (even for my salty palate) and you must be careful about the way you pick it up (danger: falling egg). The other two (concha and pollo) were made perfectly. I enjoyed the basket presentation as well. The dumplings make this place worth a stop. Also, bring your best for a good time call... They give you chalk to write in the bathroom., If I wanted to wait nearly two hours to eat dinner, I would have gone to Rose Luxury.OK, perhaps that not entirely fair - you tempt fate when you don make a reservation at a hot new restaurant in one of the city most bourgeoning restaurant neighborhoods. And perhaps this review wouldn even be, would that the hostess hadn estimated a 25-minute wait...three times. But, alas, I have a sitcom complex and would likely have awoken in a cold sweat to Seinfeld - four! had we done the responsible thing and gone to Austin Grille after the first hour passed., More like 2.5 stars. The food is very good and the decor and layout of the place are also very nice. But its overpriced (small plates style where each small plate costs the same as an entree at a good restaurant) and they super-cheaped-out with WOODEN CHOPSTICKS. I get it, its Jose Andres, it should be pricey -- wellll, the food is bomb but I was not exactly floored by everything we ate (and between the four of us, we covered a lot of the menu). You CANNOT presume to occupy the top-tier of cuisine and charge these prices and then give us shitty disposable chopsticks to eat with. Room for improvement., I went here on Valentines day and had a delicious meal! They make pisco sours with fruit juice so I got the passion fruit which was so yummy! As a vegetarian I got the Jiaozi de la Chacra dim sum and the Aeropuerto fried rice which was a pretty decent sized dish. For desert I had the Suspiro Lime31a which was amazing!!!! I didnt care about the calories. The staff there was all very friendly.My only complaint is that they dont use opentable for reservations where I earn all my points., Great place. Richie the bartender is one best in the city. The hostess are pretty and professional. The ceviche bar is great too!, A good place to go if you order the right menu item. Although the server would tell you that you are supposed to share the items, (Andres just cant shake that tapas thing I guess) there are dishes that you just cant share - e.g., $9 pork bun - just one, size of a McDouble sandwich, and some main menu items that are big enough to eat as an entree -e.g., Seco de Res. But Id be a happy camper if I went back, sat at the bar, with drinks and a $10 dollar bowl of awesome Aeropuerto fried rice dish or Tam Tam, flavorful take of Dan Dan noodles. All items were flavorful and tasty, but not all currently are at the right price point. Ask your server for item details and explore the menu., Jose Andres did it again! Amazing food! I loved the chicken lettuce wraps, Yuca fritters, and the Aeropuerto., The Gin and Tonic I had was beautiful and delicious. The food was pretty good. I really liked the Shrimp main course. The atmosphere was great. Probably because they are a new restaurant the service was not tight., Great food as always from Chef Andres and his team. Great service, great atmosphere..this man can do no wrong. I came for lunch on a Tuesday when most of DC had been shut down by (gasp!) 3 inches of snow so I can imagine how hoppin it is here on a Saturday night. The concept of Chinese and peruvian seems a little forced, and I feel the Asian aspect of the cuisine here was more Japanese, so I am confused as to why it is called China Chilcano, but what mateers is everything was delicious, from the ceviche, to the plaintain and lotus chips with spicy sweet potato sauce, to the dim sum, to their rendition of that trendy menu staple of pork belly buns., Overall i like the idea... chineese food meets a bit of Peruvian. Sadly there was more about my experience that I didnt like than I did like. Walked in there at 545. We were told we couldnt have a table because they were booked. They seated us at the bar. No waiter for 15 minutes!Its 6pm and I look around there are plenty of tables open. I ask a waitress at random to at least give us water.We ordered some bun dish... it was literally a small sandwhich the size of my palm for $9. Wasnt worth it... tasted too salty.Ordered duck tongue. That was novel for $6 and I would do it again. Salty as well.Unagi with purple potato instead of rice. For... $15 or something similar. Wasnt that impressive. Very well crafted though and very pretty but to small for what they charge.Then ordered some cocoton bowl or something like that. Had pork belly, pork grind, mushroom, bok choy, and rice. It was fantastic. It was like a peruvian meets korean bibibim bap. Not sure what part was chineese.When I left at 7. Place was quarter empty.All tables booked huh? I hate when restaurants do that pompus attitude towards customers.Overall... I wouldnt recommend this place. But if you must go... get one of the big bowls and skip the small over priced stuff.Service is great other than the first 15 minutes., Food is decent but incredibly overpriced. Waiter said theyre all tapas-style sizes so we ordered plenty but some of the dishes arent really that small so we ended up with too much food. Overall food isnt bad, but its one of those places you only go once to try. Jose Andres can do better, this is a disappointment., By and large the food and especially the cocktails we tried were good, and the menu unqiue; however, my issue was the fact that multiple dishes actually recommended by the server were ultimately unavailable -- we learned this three separate times after ordering the dishes when the server returned to tell the table that it was out of his control and the fault of the kitchen. Even an order for nigiri was accepted but then later met with the claim that there was no rice! (A bowl of rice accompanying a dish already ordered sat on our table.) I understand there sometimes are specials that run out due to popularity but that was not the case. Most disappointing was the fact that the server offered nothing apart from blame on the kitchen to compensate or accommodate. I live above this restaurant and have been waiting for its opening since Spring 2014 -- this was not the experience I had hoped for., 4.5 starsForeword from a (Chinese) foodie who loves Peruvian food and has been to Peru:I was shocked to see the poor reviews for this place. Fyi--Jose Andres didn just decide to mash Chinese, Peruvian, and Japanese food. It exists in Peru due to migratory Asian populations. And China Chilcano does a great job of modernizing and providing a fresh, delicious sampling of the mix of flavors and ingredients used in the traditional chifa/nikkei cuisine.Atmosphere: Interesting contrast of mood between the three different ectionsbetween the lighting and decor. The Nazca figures were everywhere as were traditional Chinese patterns. I wasn that impressed, but then again i tend to feel overwhelmed by Think Food Group decor in general (allot is always happening). The bathrooms were playful, with chunks of chalk and things written all over the walls.Service: our server apologized for his lack of knowledge in the piscos, but our water was refilled promptly and he had allot of patience answering our questions. Especially thankful for his honesty and then bringing over the bartender.Drinks:Chicha morada - CC does it well. It was pretty sweet, but not too thick, with the slight hints of spices. It was very refreshing and I didn want it to end. Extra points for them making it in house.Pisco macerado de pina - an infused pisco that done in house. I usually not a fan of pisco, but this was a good beverage to sip on. Be warned--it about as much as a shot only, but it was pretty strong Food:Pegao Norte31o (Lamb pot sticker)*I think this dish is a perfect example of 1) how this place is not a simple Latin-Asian fusion place and 2) how they really did their research. I Chinese. Chinese people don really eat lamb or goat too much--but in Peru they sure do... They have abundance of goats and mountain dwellers.. so what do the migrated Chinese people use to make their dumplings?? ta-da, enter chifa! The pot stickers were small but packed the strong lamb flavor, and I enjoyed the contrasting crunchiness of the lace on top. Very beautiful presentation.Tiradito de Concha Abanico(Live scallop in half-shell)* if youe here to get full, don get this. But if youe here to experience the amazing raw flavor and silky texture of scallops... GET THIS. It was definitely over too soon, but it was fresh, served right in the shell over ice, with no fishy, sea taste or smell at all.Causagiri: California (Potato causa, jumbo lump crab)* I love causa-- I would call it a tartare with potatoes. The presentation of this dish was amazing and intricate, but it was a little too potato-y for me. Almost made it dry, but then again I didn realize there was a sauce to dip it in. I think this dish was an example of the odernizationof Peruvian Nikkei... I know Causa exists in a larger form, but the tiny cuts of them to look like sushi may be just a clever twist on the traditional Peruvian dish.Anticucho: Lengua de Pato(Duck tongue) * definitely a small tapas / izakaya type dish. It was pretty good, but on the fatty side. The gooseberry juiciness balanced out the grease of the duck tongue and the starch of the potato (which was perfectly roasted). You couldn make a meal out of this, but worth getting.Jaladito Norte31o(Hamachi tiradito-style)* This was what I got as my aindish and was a little disappointed. The aji amarillo leche de tigre was great--I slurped every last drop of it... but... I expected a different sauce texture. When Ie had tiradito, the sauce tended to be thicker, and thus grabs the raw fish better. On top of that, hamachi doesnt have a very distinct, strong flavor, and without the sauce sticking, it made the dish a little lacking.Suspiro Lime31a* The presentation is a little strange, like little pieces of chalk sticking out of mud, but once you get past that it pretty delicious. That is, if you can eat spoonfuls of dulce de leche--a super rich and sweet caramel-like cream. It was good, but between the merengues and condensed milk, it was a little too rich and sweet for me. The passionfruit cuts through the sweetness, though, which is refreshing.Ponderaciones de Kiwicha * I was very happy with this choice. The chocolatey mousse-y goodness with cocoa dust and cool, refreshing ice cream was immaculate. I coulde done without the banana with caramelized sugar. The cookie was crispy, light, and perfect to dip into the chocolate cream. Y30n W5d Birds Nest Soup * It was definitely different, and packed a variety of flavors, so if youe adventurous and crave something besides chocolate or straight up sugar, this will definitely surprise your pallet.OVERALLLove this place. It not somewhere you come to simply fill your belly. You have to be ready to spend, and ready to experience the multitude of flavors and flavor mixtures China Chilcano has to present. Servers need more time to get seasoned, and dish timing will need to be improved, but Il definitely be back!!, First time there, only been open 2 weeks and today was the first roll out of the lunch menu. The ceviche was amazing! The atmosphere was cool and the bathrooms are quirky and fun with chalk boards where you can leave a message. Dessert was good, try the one with the coconut!, We had lunch. The quality and presentation of the food was very good. Service very good and the waiters are very aware of what they serve. The restaurant is spacious and well decorated. The restaurant is well located and there are parking facilities around., DCs hot new JA restaurant... It was good but not fabulous. Its a JA restaurant with standard small plate setting. My favorite dish was Aji de Gallina and Lomo Saltado. Interesting twist on the items but very good. It was fun to try all the different things. The chifles were a bit soggy but the creamy sauce it came with was fantastic. Also their twist on Sriracha sauce is different but good!! I wouldnt consider this true, authentic Peruvian food but its an upscale fusion of Asian and Peruvian., I made reservations on their website and was only offered a 4pm or 11pm reservation for a Saturday evening.. .this was the case for every weekend from the next month. When I arrived at 11 for my 11:15 reservation there was actually more tables than I expected so I wondering why they had blocked off so many tables since they were by no means super packed. We were seated immediately and ordered a pisco sour and algarrobina. Both were delish. Ive only had a few other pisco sours so it tasted good from what Ie tried. Food: We started off with the pegao nortena, lamb potstickers with a strong influence of cumin and gold flakes. The presentation was beautiful and not at all what I was expecting when I ordered pot stickers but I was pleasantly surprised! I half indian so the strong influence of cumin in this dish reminded me of my mothers cooking which is not a bad thing at all! Next we ordered the Nobu Usuzukuri, which is a flounder ceviche. Once again I was expecting the classic ceviche in some sort of bowl with ice underneath but that is not what we got :) Instead thin slices of flounder were paired with watermelon radish and sweet drop pepper which I coulde eaten a full bowl of! After that we moved on to the classic lomo saltado. This was probably my least favorite dishes and I think its because I personally love potatoes and french fries a little too much. The lomo didnt come with the thick cut french fry that I am use to and it was a little salty for my liking. Regardless the meat was cooked perfectly and the flavor was on point. Last but certainly not least was the Concolon. It was delicious and I highly recommend ordering it. The waiter brings a large bowl to your table and tells you what each item is (egg, turnips, bok choy, pork belly, mushroom). While explaining each item he mixes them all together for you and then hands it over to you. This was by far the largest item on the menu we ordered and definitely geared to fill you up. This is definitely one of those restaurants where you will pay a higher price for smaller sized dishes but you are paying for quality. The quality was fresh, flavors were distinctful in each dish and executed wonderfully! Don go there starving and expect a classic American heaping plate to fill you up to the max., Really exceeded my expectations. As a Peruvian, I was skeptical since the Peruvian food quality in the DC metropolitan area isnt that great. China Chilcano hit every note perfectly. The ambience, service, and above all food was superior. The plates are small so that they can be shared, making things a little more fun and adventurous. The pisco sour cocktail was extremely smooth, I had to order two. I highly recommend to anyone especially if youre looking to try something new, This place was fun! Didnt seem like a lot of food amongst the four of us but somehow we all walked out plenty full. Go fig!, Its been a few weeks since this opened so I decided it was finally time to try it with the hopes that most of the menu kinks have been worked out. Being a big Jose fan I pretty much knew what to expect when coming here, visually stimulating interior design, good service, and tapas on tapas. China Chilcano bring dishes form Peru, Asia, and Japan and fuses them together into beautiful to look at bite sized treats. I got to say out of all of Mr. Andres restaurants, the plates here looked the most aesthetically pleasing, many layers on colors on shapes all served on or in a neat complimentary plate or dish. What I got:Horchata- Tasted a little different than most horchatas Ive had because this one was made with quinoa instead of rice, added a unique taste to it, still it was refreshing. Sanguche de chancho nipon- This was a well hand sized pork belly sandwich that was loaded with sweet potato, miso, and a well sized slab of pork belly. The bun it was housed in was steamed and had a sweet honey taste to it. Very interesting cross of sweet meets spicy meets savory. Didnt love it, didnt hate it. Papas a la huancaina- This dish looked amazing, it was a work of art! Potato, ahi amarillo sauce, fresh cheese (looked like quest fresco), botija olive, and tiny qual eggs. These potato bites were just as refreshing as they were savory.Ceviche classico la mar- This ceviche was pretty standard, fresh market fish accompanied with sweet potato, red onion, cilantro, and what seemed like toasted pieces of corn which provided for some good crunch in the texture and fishy taste.California Causagiris- Think a standard california sushi roll except replace the rice with potato causa. Tasted very similar to it too although it had a lot of similarities to the papas a la huancaina, I could have done with one or the other although they both did look quite cool. Lomo Saltado- The prime strip was cooked perfectly medium and it came in a bowl with lots of other goodies (tomato, peppers, shoestring potatos, and rice). This tasted like classic logo salted Ive had before but it was a tad salty on the teriyaki side for me, still delicious though. I love tapas, I love restaurants like this. Combine the food mentioned above with great service (Francisco was the man!) and a friendly manager who made us feel quite welcome and you have a great dining experience. As with most of these types of restaurants, I hope to come back very soon and try all the other things I missed., Went here during the blizzard which ended up being a real treat because we were the only idiots out in the blizzard. Ordered something from just about every section, including this Sui Mai Dorado thing which was had a quail egg on top. I could have eaten 500 of those. I told the people next to us, who were also idiots for coming out in the blizzard I could have eaten 500 of those., This was out first visit to ab obviously high grade restaurant with a complex theme crossing asian and peruvian boundaries. The menu sheet itself requires a lot of study to figure out what you actually will receive-and what size it will be. We had 2 dim sum and they were both very good, as was the snapper and the bite-sized chicken street food ( bottom right side of menu). Our bottle of spanish monestrelle was outstanding and a good value, and our waitress Triana--quite attentive. In musical terms if you are a lover of the romantic period--this restaurant is a bit more like what romantics: think about rock! Big change from the usual--will take some adjustment, but happy to return., Top-line review: Fun atmosphere, beautiful space, good food, expensive. Theyve done a great job with the build out on this restaurant, its lively and fun inside. Started with the pork bun, which was great - really pricey for such a small order ($9 for just one) pork bun. Though I appreciate that the waitress alerted us that the dish came with just one when we were ordering for two. Also, ordered the steamed snapper - the presentation was beautiful. It came in wrapped in a beautiful puffed clear plastic balloon, they untied tableside at which point they added a sauce, and herbs. Great presentation... it was good, but Im just not convinced it was $17 tasty. I was expecting with such a presentation it would knock my socks off. It was just good.Tried the Tam-tam noodles. The noodles themselves were outstanding - the texture incredible! However, they advertise them as spicy, which they are a far cry from. The dish desperately lacked heat, and was overall sort of bland. Nevertheless, really appreciated the fresh noodles. Also tried a pisco sour - which was fine. Overall I think the food is overpriced for what it is. Still tasty., I give this a hearty 4 stars for the food! On a cold February Saturday afternoon I ventured out to savor Jose Andress latest masterpiece. Since it was not listed on Opentable I had to make a reservation through the restaurants own website. Right opposite Oyamel, China Chilcano is easy to find. The decor is way too eclectic for my taste, with naked light bulbs, and odd assortment of seating furniture and camouflaged bathrooms with colored chalk should you wish to scribble on the walls as youre doing a number.The menu was equally confusing with a section for Chinese, Japanese and Peruvian, not to mention exceptionally slow service.However, all these impressions are secondary to the spectacular palette-pleasing dishes. The flounder and sea-urchin sushi is incredible, with an unusual and teasing flavor. The scallop, freshly prepared with roe (or was that dipping dots? ) ut the star of the show is the fish in the papillote. It is plastic steamed, with a taste that is delicate and sophisticated! I will be back for more!!, The place is a bit glitzy/tacky and the kitchen was incredibly slow. The portions were TINY and we got sick of being told about jose andres small plates concept like we were tourists from kansas, which is what this place seems designed to appeal to. Its also a real rip off at these prices. You need to order about 6 or 7 items each to not leave hungry and at that point you have run up a huge tab. Food was pretty good, not great -- overall thumbs down., A friend who was visiting from out of town and I love Jose Andres restaurants and were so excited to learn that Jose Andresnewest restaurant, China Chilcano, had opened and was so conveniently located in Penn Quarter! It actually funny, because Jose Andres has several restaurants within a few blocks of each other (Jaleo, Minibar, Barmini, Zaytinia, Oyamel, and now China Chilcano). I previously been to Jaleo, Zaytinia, and Oyamel, and was now very excited to try China Chilcano. Walk-ins on a Saturday night (even on a very cold, blistery late February Saturday night) are almost impossible. I would highly recommend getting reservations. Even so, we couldn get a reservation until 10:15pm! We decided to take that reservation and we went to another restaurant/bar in the area while waiting. They texted us when our reservation was ready, which was very nice. We had already had drinks elsewhere, so we stuck with solely food. The food is tapas style, so we decided to share several different dishes.We ordered:-Uni (off the Causigiris portion of the menu), which came with Nigiri-style potato causa, fresh sea urchin, wasabi, masago pearls, and yuzu). This was pretty interesting - the potato causa substituted for rice was an interesting addition. Not sure how I feel about potato in my sushi. But I did not like how salty this dish was. Very hard to swallow. And Ie had sea urchin in sushi before and previously liked it. Not my favorite dish and not sure I order this one again.-California (also off the Causigiris portion of the menu), which came with potato causa, jumbo lump crab, tobiko, spicy mayo, cucumber, avocado, huancaina sauce). This was actually a tasty dish, though again I not sure how I feel about potato being in my sushi rolls. Very interesting / different concept. Not as salty as the Uni, though, so it was edible and tasty enough. Probably tasted better than regular California rolls, of which I am not a big fan.-Lomo Saltado (off the Chinese Connection portion of the menu), which came with prime strip steak, tomato, soy sauce, shishito pepper, ginger, shoestring potatoes, and rice. This was probably the most fusion-y dish we ordered. Very interesting combo. I definitely think that South American food and Asian food meshes very well together in tapas form (Ie thought that since I tried Zengo in Chinatown a few years ago). Oh, and this came with rice too,.-Jaladito Norteno (off the Ceviches and Tiraditos portion of the menu), which came with hamachi tiradito-style, aji amarillo leche de tigre, Peruvian corn, huacatay. This was pretty delicious and I liked it a lot. I love hamachi generally and I loved the fusion of flavors in this dish particularly.The restaurant is very pretty - lots of bright lights and a light / clean motif going on. Everything was shiny with light colors. And there was an interesting graffiti concept going on in the restroom. They even have chalk for people to draw on the bathroom walls. Very interesting. Service was alright, though they did accidentally almost take our food to the table next to us.I still prefer Zaytinya, Oyamel, and Jaleo, but I think people should give China Chilcano a fair chance too.
15|conosci-washington|New secret restaurant that you can find behind a velvet curtain in Alta Strada. I visited a week after this restaurant opened with two of my friends and had an incredible experience! We ordered the $45 tasting menu (which included 6 small bites and 1 dessert) and a $45 drink pairing. The restaurant was very flexible with food/price preferences. Overall, I thought it was an amazing treat and I would love to come back! The meal was mostly comprised of crudo samplers of ahi tuna, octopus, lobster, crab -- and all were amazing!Drink pairings were mostly wines (very unique ones that paired well!) and some cocktails!Definitely recommend., I would give this place 6 stars if I could. This past Saturday night, I made a reservation at Conosci -- the new Crudo Bar in the City Vista Building hidden inside Alta Strada-City Vista. Since Im not a huge raw food fanatic, let alone eat much seafood, I was just expecting to share a dish or two with a friend to expand my dietary boundaries. Little did I know that I would have the true honor of being served by renowned Boston-based Professional Chef and Successful Restaurateur, Chef Michael Schlow and his Director of Culinary Operations, Chef Luis Morales. We opted for the $45 tasting menu where we placed our taste buds in their hands. They really took the time to carefully choose dishes, with the help of our delightful server Cheyenne, that we looked forward to eating. Boy did Conosci open my mind to the real culinary potential of seafood and my overall comfort level with Crudo Bars. The ambience was romantic and intimate with a breathtaking candle-lit wall behind the chefs. Delicious Tuna on top of an Edamame Pur39e, Albacore with Tonnato Sauce, Snap Peas with Walnuts and Pecorino, Spring Mushrooms with a Green Onion Compote and Hazelnut Frico Chip, Warm Crabmeat Risotto and Prime Beef Tataki with Miso-Mustard are only a few dishes your taste buds will fall in love with at Conosci. I would like to extend a personal thank you to Chef Michael and Chef Luis for showing 5-year old me not to give up on seafood. I cant wait to be back and try the $135 tasting menu, my taste buds are ready!, I think it was a miracle we managed to get to Conosci on a Saturday night just a week after it opened. It also very puzzling how low profile this place seems to be with just two reviews! (but perhaps this is part of the same plan of hiding the restaurant behind the curtains?)This was a feast. This was as intimate as sitting in a chef kitchen. This was an outstanding 6 course dinner for the price of a mediocre night out elsewhere. This was personal, and exciting, and teasing your palate celebration, the one that keeps coming up in your head for hours and days, each time bringing up a silent wow. An experience of a grand scale that you hardly expected walking in the door of Alta Strada. Seating at the tiny bar we could watch Chef Michael with his crew of two sous chefs meticulously plating each and every dish. Portions were generous and exploding with flavor. They lovingly treated each ingredient and plate, sprinkling, dashing and drizzling components with myriad of sauces, spices and herbs. Being a true crudo bar the place features just one tiny hot top and two toasters - you know like the ones you had in your dorm room - with which the chef managed to cook an unbelievable crab risotto, lobster with mushrooms and a few other hot plates. There was no plan, no pre-printed course set up, but just a ticket saying a 6 or 12 course prix fix dinner - and the chef put together combinations on the fly, checking with his team what has been previously served to a table. He also came to tables, talked to everyone at the bar, making us feeling so welcomed. He eagerly shared the reasoning behind the dishes, described the flavors and chatted about his life - as if putting together such an elaborate dinner for 30 diners present at the moment took no effort at all. It felt very personal and very welcoming, making this by far one of my most memorable experiences in DC. I just wish I could re-live it all over again!PS: the restaurant also serves a-la carte options of the same dishes, in the range of $9-$19. 6 courses prix fix is $45 pp, 12-15 is $135., What a cool concept! It a speakeasy style restaurant - it is located without signage inside Alta Strada. It is the District first restaurant dedicated just to raw food. There are raw bar sections of menus at many places, but this is the first actual raw bar. And holy crap it is awesome.They offer a variety of plates from small to large with the average price around $16. They offer two tasting menus - $45 and 135 per person. $45 is six courses and a small dessert, 135 is around fifteen courses and a small dessert. My wife and I chose the $45. We were treated to six delicious seafood courses. Highlights included tuna poke which was seasoned with yuzu and chilis -- the sweet-and-spicy combination with amazingly rich and tender tuna poke was nearly perfect. The final course was a risotto with crab, uni, and scallions. I a sucker for the rich umami of uni, but combined with a perfectly cooked risotto elevated it to another level. I asked about the portions -- each tasting menu course is about 2/3 the size of a plate, so the $45 is a clear win on price. After the six courses and dessert, we were both pleasantly full. The $135 is definitely a didn eat lunch sort of dinner. Il be back to try it though. Sietsema just reviewed this place and confirmed everything I said. Get in before it overrun!, Not good. Not sure if we hit it on a bad night but I cannot believe how much we paid for fish soup! Opted for tasting menu for $85 each. Several small seafood dishes - 2 were just bad. Risotto and desert were good. Will not be back., I loved this place, but I gotta take away one star. First, the positives:+ Amazing vibe; beautifully decorated+ Awesome staff - extremely attentive and engaging (skills they learned from the ever-present chef)+ Yummy cocktails. We tried 4 of them and liked them all. They also have some interesting wines and sake. + DELIGHTFUL food. The risotto with umi is one of the best dishes Ie ever had anywhere. The raw dishes were all creative and luscious. There just one negative, but I think it important: they have 3 tasting menus ($45, $85, $135) with different numbers of courses. We chose the middle road, as I assume most people will, and the waitress assured us that it was plenty of food. Unfortunately, it wasn. After the tasting menu, we were all still hungry, so we had to order additional items. The format calls to mind omakase and kaiseki styles. In Japan, they balance the low-volume (high taste!!) raw courses with soups and other heartier courses to provide balance, and they always close with a rice-based course. The risotto is delicious and gets close here, but it frustrating to have to order more after an $85 menu. I don mean to emphasize the negative. This is a 6-star place once they sort out the portioning, and we look forward to enjoying it for years to come., What a wonderful meal- we sat at the chefs counter, and ordered the middle range tasting menu. Every bite was wonderful, creative, and unique. The fish was incredibly fresh and beautifully prepared, and the warm dishes (like a play on carbonara with bacon and ramen) were amazing too. The service was terrific, and it was a blast watching the chefs work and talking to them about what they were doing. This is definitely a hidden gem. I cant wait to go back!, Great surprise. Ive enjoyed Alta Strada without knowing this place was hidden behind a curtain. We did 6 courses a la carte. 4 fish. 2 veg. All incredible. If you dont like fish, you probably wont love it. I thought it was incredible., A plate licking (no, Im not kidding) celebration of gastronomical gems. The poke and hamachi were faves. Risotto was a nice comforting closeout, and I look forward to trying their mushroom dish and take on the carbonara. The dark chocolate and pistachio dessert was purely sinful. So delighted to have this little bit of heaven in my neck of the woods. BTW, love the speakeasy restaurant concept and will be on the search for more!, Put Yourself In Their Hands - for at least the $45 pp / 6 course option! Looking at the menu we both wished we could eat more and would have gone for the $85 option. Our favorite from all of the amazing selections was the Tuna Poke with chilies, cilantro and yuzo, followed closely by the outstanding Risotto with crab, uni and green onions. I could go on and name the other 3 entrees but I just be looking for new adjectives to describe an overall outstanding experience. In addition to a beautiful split cherry extra course served mid-meal, our dessert was a delicious creamy Chocolate Budino served in an oversized shot glass. With 3 drinks, before tip, the bill came to around $153 - not inexpensive but well worth the price., CONOSCI by Chef Michael SchlowStarting with the decor and the playlist...we cannot rave enough about the fresh take on, and creative combinations of flavors, in each bite. Erics wine pairings are sublimely (and interestingly!) perfect. A true must-return hit!, I found this place after looking on the website thrillist. It sounded really good so I thought I would try it with my friend. First off, the restaurant is a speakeasy restaurant (it is hidden in another restaurant). The atmosphere is so calm and enjoyable because the dinning room is small. The food and wine are absolutely incredible. We ordered the $45 put yourself in their hands and a glasses of the Gamay. Well the food was outstanding! This is one of the best places I have ever eaten! The plates are small but for the amount of flavors you get I had absolutely no issues. The staff is amazing. They describe each dish when they arrive and offer help with pairing great wines. The Gamay was an amazing red wine. After the 5th course we decided to upgrade to the $85 put yourself in their hands and let me say it was 1000% worth it. Honestly, one of the best restaurants I have ever been to and will definitely be coming back., Amazing experience here . The food was incredible the drinks were great and the service was spot on .Our server Steve was very good a suggesting items and answering our questions . We will be back soon !!, Beautiful place. Beautiful food. Conosci is a new restaurant in our neighborhood. So we decided to give it a try without knowing the theme of this restaurant is raw food. We both had a stomachache after coming home and had to run to the bathroom a few times. AC was too strong. Extremely cold when we were eating. Alta Strada on the other side of the curtain had normal temperature., Excellent $85 tasting menu. All courses were on the mark save an octopus dish that was spicy enough that we had to delay the next course so our tongues and lips could cool down (it was exception its own, just hard to sequence into a tasting menu). Out server Christine was excellent as was the sommelier and wine list. The dining room is still young and we hope will mature and become even better., This place is special. Im not going to write a long review telling you about everything that happens here, that would ruin the experience...just go. You will be surprised at every dish that comes out and they are all good., Outstanding! Everything we ate was perfection. A must do. Great service as well. Tuna poke a stand out., This is a decidedly mixed review. My friend and I agreed to order the tasting menu after telling the server that we had certain diet restrictions. He said no problem, and we detailed the limitations. Unfortunately, this was not properly conveyed to the kitchen; and I could not eat all of the dishes that we were served. That said, even the dishes that I ate varied from delicious (tuna poke, mushrooms) to blazingly hot (snapper) to bland (hamachi). My recommendation is that if you have any dietary limitations, order ala carte., Excellent service with a very friendly, fun, and knowledgeable staff. We recommend the put yourself in their hands tasting menu. This time we went with the pricier option ($135 for 12 courses including some items not on the menu). While we were not sure how this compared to the other tiers $(45 for 6 courses or $85 for a modified menu), we all left a little disappointed at the total amount of food and what we actually got for our money. Do not get me wrong - the food was delicious, but the portions were very small. When you get 12 courses, you expect to walk away full, but our table of 2 guys and 2 girls easily could have eaten more (perhaps a testament to the quality of the food). There was not a bad dish - we just wished we had a bit more, particularly of the tuna, the steak, and any other favorites. Cocktails were very good and the restaurant also had a nice ambiance - dimly lit, quiet, and distinct from neighboring Altra Strada which it shares space with. Good experience - but wel try another restaurant next time., Enter Alta Strada and take the velvet curtains on the back left, and there is the small space of Conosci!We ordered the $45 tasting menu and had five savory dishes and 1 dessert. For 6 dishes total, it was quite a light meal, and would recommend going up to the $65 tasting menu if you are hungry. I really enjoyed all of the 6 dishes, and they were small tastings from the a la carte menu. My favorite was the octopus dish and oyster dish. The tune poke was not what I expected and the sauce was a bit too much for me, covering up the natural flavors of the tuna. The dark chocolate mousse that we ended our meal on was divine! Not too sweet, just perfect. If you want a wine pairing to go along with the meal, it is equivalent to how much the tasting is (i.e. 45 tasting menu + 45 wine tasting).The initial interaction with restaurant was odd as I had made a reservation through open table and we had to wait for 20 minute until our table was ready. The host seemed a bit confused and was unable to tell us when the table would actually be ready.
16|corduroy-washington|Corduroy is a hidden gem of a restaurant. It is inside the Sheraton Four Points hotel in McPherson Sq. They have the absolute best service in DC. Servers know everything about the wines and the food menu (which changes every few months to include the best seasonal offerings). They bring everything out promptly, never interrupt you, and bring proper utensils to the table at just the right times. This is the perfect place for special occasions. You can even arrange a special menu (complete with name personalization/message on the menu) ahead of time to request favorite dishes. The food never disappoints. Although menu items seem basic or simple, theyre not. For example, their Parsnip Soup is rich, warm, and creamy because they puree foie gras into it. Try their current offering of soup, buffalo mozzeralla porcupine, lobster carpaccio, Sunnyside Farm chicken, and have them pair your dessert with a wonderful port wine. Trust me, you will not be disappointed., Tom Powers creates simple dishes that sing when the food touches your palate. Buffalo Mozzarella is the by far one of my favorite dishes at Corduroy. A piece of buffalo mozzarella is served with crispy wisps of fried noodles. Youd think that mozzarella would be heavy and the fried noodles to be oily, but in fact its a light as a feather. The mozzarella, slightly warmed tastes like heaven and the thin friend noodles like gossamer threads. I cant say enough about the place. While the decor makes it look like a hotel bar (which it is), the food and the service is impeccable., I think there wine list needs work, the food is consistently very good -- the micro-green, beet and goat cheese salad was amazing -- and I think they always for a wonderful job with all things seafood...Very good service, but the atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired -- looking forward to their new space., Corduroy is often described as a hidden treasure in the DC restaurant scene and I tend to agree with the sentiment after eating there. It is literally hidden away in the second floor of the Sheraton Four Points hotel at 12 and K. There not much going on over there except the convention center 3 blocks north. And probably some infamous K st hookers...Anyway, the decor is lovely and it is very intimate. I went during Restaurant Week on Aug 17 and was not pleased to find that some of the items on the menu had an upcharge of $5. I know it doesn sound like a lot, but when you add that on to 2 of the three courses it no longer stays at the RW price of $30.06. If you are going to participate in RW do it right!My first course was the lobster salad ($5 upcharge). The portion was rather small, but there were nice large chunks of lobster meat with a not too heavy sauce. My friend had the soft shell crab ($5 upcharge) and that was very good.My second course was a lamb sirloin w/ mini goat cheese ravioli. The lamb was a little tough but the mini ravioli was excellent and delicate. My friend got the well-known scallops ($5 upcharge) and they were definitely tasty. The accompanying mashed potatoes were excellent.For dessert I got vanilla bean creme brulee and my friend got the chocolate tarte. My creme brulee was awesome. The tart was from a dark chocolate and a little too intense. However, the carmelized banana w/ a drop of chocolate ice cream was a nice compliment to the overpowering tart.Overall, the service was very good. I was disappointed with their lack of wine by the glass. I ended up with a Cab/Rose blend which turned out to be a great choice with what I ordered but I still wish there was more variety. I would definitely return someday to sample other items on the menu!, It is no surprise that the head chef of Corduroy Tom Power worked at Citronelle previously. The presentation is exceptional. The ingredients used are very fresh and top quality. I guess that the majority of Corduroys clientele comes from the hotel, or at least I hope it does. I have never had to wait for a table. I really like the vibe here- it is chic and comfy all at the same time.Lets see...my usual food recommendations: Start with the beet, carrot and goat cheese salad. If youre in the mood, be sure to order a wine of the fab wine list here- I have had the St. Joseph red wine a few times. Cant remember the exact name of it, but it has a cherry undertone. Ask your waiter and I am sure he/she will point you in the right direction. For the main course, the lamb with mini raviolis -- the lamb is cooked perfectly with a nice crispy crust and tender inside., The service was a bit slow at my restaurant week dinner here, but otherwise I was quite happy with the food. I started out with the carpaccio of lobster, which was amazing, and then had a roast lamb sirloin with mini ravioli that was every bit as good as it sounds!! The decor was okay, although I did find the location (in the hotel) a bit unappealing. Im not sure that my vegetarian girlfriend would find much to eat here, however., Im been to Corduroy three times, twice for restaurant week, and recently for lunch. Its a great deal for restaurant week. Yes, there are upcharges on some things but they make the whole menu available so I think thats nice. I love the soups and salads here. Its also a great place to take parents. I think it is the quietest restaurant in the city. The service is wonderful as well. My only problem? Im a vegetarian and my choice for an entree is the vegetable sampler. Its a good vegetable sampler, but... in the end its just a sampler. This time when I returned for lunch I got the soup and salad as was much happier. So thats what Im going to focus on in the future., Corduroy, located on the second floor of the Sheraton Four Points hotel, seems designed to discourage intimacy. First off, how are we diners all supposed to get to know each other if shorts are not permitted in the dining room during dinner? I ask you. This problem is compounded by the tables being situated with a good four feet of free space on all sides, perhaps to circumvent the possibility of illicit eavesdropping (or at least that speculation upped the aura of the place a few notches). Finally, the extra-long table separated the boif and I by a chasm of tablecloth (perhaps to discourage the exchange of government secrets by way of seemingly innocent handholding). Alright so I have no idea if Corduroy is even routinely frequented by government bigwigs but allow me my little fantasies. None of these factors ended up being cause for complaint, for frankly, knees are just very unattractive joints when it comes down to it, the space in between the tables allowed for the wild gesticulation that typically gets worked into my various rants on the state of cinema and why goat cheese is superlative in all regards and our hand were too busy demolishing the deliciousness that was placed before us by attentive and kindly wait-staff (I don know when was the last time I have had a server come over to apologize for the barely late arrival of a main course) to spend time locked in phalangeal embrace. -an unnecessary and indulgent aside: Let me digress for a moment on the subject of birthdays. I love presents and I love that I was born. I do not, however, particularly like presents on my birthday. It is not that I disparage such things, it just that I don really care if I get anything on my birthday. I think that present-centric celebrations prompt people to purchase gifts out of a sense of obligation rather than thoughtfulness and that while often these two sensibilities are successfully wed, just as often they are not. Consequently, I prefer the random gifting inspired by the discovery of something you know a close friend or relation would appreciate, or a token meant to indicate your appreciation for their existence on any old day, that shows that you are struck by a pang of joy at their being in your life on days other than the anniversary of their finding the way out of the womb. What this is building up to is this: the gift of the meal. I feel that the meal is the ideal gift, for it combines the two excellent factors of gustation and good company. What better way to show that you appreciate someone than by spending time with them and buying them foods? Maybe this is a way for me to feel alright with requesting a bunch of meal presents, maybe its because I became unaccustomed to receiving presents after having a pony ended up being an eleven year continual present that headed any non-pony-related presents off at the pass. In any case, meal-cum-birthday present leaves little to be desired.-Who knows if any DC destination is renowned for its atmosphere, but what Corduroy lacked in je ne said quoi it made up for with its dishes. The beet, baby carrot and goat cheese entre was full-flavored, slightly tangy, and dotted with crispy greens. Had the goat cheese been served in a nice soft brick I would have enjoyed it more (for some reason the chef chose to fill the well of the plate with a paper-thin coaster of the cheese and pile the beets etc on top, requiring me to turn my fork into a spackling knife to scrape the cheese off the plate), but in terms of taste there was nothing lacking. The buffalo mozzarella porcupine was a pliant pincushion of mozzarella covered in tines of fry hunkering in a light green sauce. The plats were equally satisfying, though the sauce on the chicken with arugula was a tiny bit too rich and might have more complimentarily served a slightly heartier fowl. They did not skimp on the greens, however, which is a disappointing exercising of restraint oft-experienced in my dining escapades. The pork belly was tender and easily sliced and the mustard provided a nice accent while the cabbage rounded out the lighter taste of the pork with a heavier earthy flavor. We passed on dessert, for while the plates we observed passing by looked acceptable, the offerings themselves were unremarkable enough not to pique our interest. Ah yes, does one really need to sample another creme brule when one has consumed so very very many? So if you find yourself adrift in our nation perplexingly arranged, populated, decorated and administered capitol, soothe yourself with a fine dining experience at Corduroy. Especially if youe got a present coming to you., These days, it become very trendy to serve really fresh ingredients as the focus for a restaurant. Unfortunately, it usually means a lack of interesting preparation, with meats and fishes quickly pan-seared and vegetables blanched and barely seasoned. Luckily, Corduroy doesn fall into that trap. Everything here is fresh, but is also prepared in pretty phenomenal ways. Try the pork belly with cabbage as an example. And it all very reasonably priced., I was very impressed by the lunch I had here a few days ago. It was also surprisingly cheap. Drink, app and entree with 20% tip was @$30. Not cornery bakery cheap. But considering I had warm goat cheese in crispy potato as an appetizer and the AMAZING lamb sirloin for my entree, Id much rather spend the additional $20.I really cant wait to return here. Ill have to check out dinner too., Loved it.Came during Restaurant Week, knowing that a good portion of the menu would be available. I always skeptical of restaurants in hotels, which are usually a complete rip-off complete with really unimpressive food. But this place served one of the best meals Ie had in DC--RW or not.My friend and I both started out w/the buffalo mozzarella porcupine. I wasn sure what to expect, but it involved two key words: fried and cheese. For a main course, I ordered lamb sirloin, which was served w/mini goat cheese ravioli. My friend got the roasted chicken w/arugula, which I suggested he get based on Jason review on dcfoodies.com. Some bread was delivered to the table, and I don remember what about it was so good, but I do remember that is was really, really good. Maybe it was focaccia? I don know. But it was good. :o)Our appetizers came out and I could not wait to dig in. I not sure what the fresh, ample ball of mozzarella was wrapped in (it looked almost like spaghetti, but definitely was not), but it was delicious (photo: axcessmypics.com/photos/206). From the salty, crunchy, yummy threads to the pools of tomato and basil coulis on which the porcupine was plated, I was hooked. I remember telling my friend I coulde eaten one of those and a salad and would have been a perfectly content diner. When we saw waiters delivering these appetizers to other diners later in the evening, even after we had dessert, my friend and I were sad: we wanted more of these for ourselves.But nooooo. Next up was the main course. My friend loved his chicken: it was tender and flavorful. He pronounced it some of the best chicken he had. If I recall correctly, it was a whole chicken, about the size of a Cornish game hen. My lamb was wonderful, but I went crazy over those ravioli (photo: axcessmypics.com/photos/206). I was afraid i wasn going to like them, as milk from a goat teat scares me a bit, but this wasn a problem at all. I ate those little suckers up. My friend and I decided to switch plates so we could have half of each. When he handed over his to me, I noticed the chicken had almost no meat on it, and the garlic mashed potatoes atop which it had been perched were missing. Did the kitchen give him a measly portion? Had they simply forgotten to add all the components to the meal? NO. The greedy bastard had ravenously torn through the chicken and muste licked the potatoes clean off the plate.My friend had vanilla bean creme brulee for dessert, which had a perfectly crispy, caramelized lid--no sogginess here. I opted for some sort of special that night, which was a toffee and chocolate bar, maybe? Whatever it was, it tasted like a really jacked up, amazingly good candy bar. It was very rich and very, very, very yummy.Throughout the evening, our service was impeccable. The waiters didn look at us funny when we wanted regular water instead of sparkling or still. They didn treat us like less people because wee clearly younger folks. They didn change the way they worked or acted because it was RW. The staff was extremely polite and did a fantastic job of making me and my friend feel like special patrons at the restaurant.The decor wasn overly ritzy or tacky. The room is mostly dark, w/muted, subdued colors. I recall some chandeliers on the ceiling. The shape and the overall atmosphere reminded me of being on a cruise, actually: I sat w/my back at a wall on which there were windows, so I felt like I coulde looked outside and seen the ocean. An interesting decor choice was a strip of mirror above the curtains. The mirror was angled down, so when people walked up behind my roommate, who was facing the window, he could see who was behind him. He would say, Ooooh, that dish looks good when waiters walked by. After leaving Corduroy, my friend and I were pleasantly full and very excited over the experience we had. From the service to the food, both of us couldn stop talking about what a fantastic meal we had., Very enjoyable, pretty darn good, but not without a few imperfections.We had a party of seven, and we came for an early dinner, which meant we had pretty relaxed waitpeople, and plenty of attention.I didn actually look at the wine list, but we had two very nice labels, the first a Sancerre, and the second a Chateauneuf du Pape. Both were lovely.For first course I got one of the specials, which was lobster carpaccio with mustard greens. It was very subtle, and I enjoyed it alot. My husband got the pea soup, which was also very subtle but tasty. Several people got the oysters on the half-shell with a champagne mignonette, and I tried one -- very bright and acidic. I didn really taste oyster at all, which was just fine with me.Second course I chose the sea scallops with mashed potato and chantarelle mushrooms. I ate every bite on the plate! It was very tasty, rich but not too much so. But it was the second course that other people had issues with. The soft shell crab was a bit too limp and greasy, while the buffalo rib eye was flavorless according to one diner. I don really believe it had NO flavor, but it was probably pretty subtle, if the dishes I had were any clue.Desserts were yummy, as you would expect from a disciple of Michel Richard. I had an extremely rich, dense chocolate tart with cooked carmelized bananas. Several folks got the fresh berries with a really great lemon sorbet. The pistacchio bread pudding was tasty and nutty, but not too dense, and the chocolate sabayon was to die for.All in all, we had a very nice evening at Corduroy. My food was excellent, the wines were great, and the service was perfect -- the wait staff was as subtle as the food, but just as effective. The only reason I give four stars and not five is that some of my companions weren as pleased as I, and guess their experiences should count for something too., Had Easter Dinner here with my parents. The decor is understated, very basic, but nice. The food was excellent; much better than I was expecting given that it in a hotel and looked a bit bland. The service was good and the overall experience was great. The food didn pop, it was pretty normal stuff; just really well-prepared., Hidden treasure is right. Corduroy is one of my favorite restaurants that many just dont seem to know about because it is tucked away inside the Sheraton Four Points. This is the place I take folks to when they come to town to impress them with DC cuisine. The service is impeccable, the food always excellent and interesting, and the atmosphere sophisticated and quiet, unlike so many DC restaurants. I adore Corduroy and if I could afford to eat here every day, I would set up a permanent reservation., Corduroy is the best hotel restaurant Ive ever had the pleasure to enter. Overall, it could be my favorite place in DC. Definitely top three. Calling it a hotel restaurant gives it a disservice. The diner does not feel that he or she is in a hotel. Its an oasis inside the Four Points. Its hard to find--enter the hotel and take the stairs to your immediate left. Ive been here for four subsequent restaurant weeks. Each time has been truly wonderful. Their chilled tomato soup is without question the best I have ever had. OK, let me stop my random gushing. Corduroys general modus operandi is to serve seasonal food, most of their offerings coming from local farms. The only way you could be eating fresher produce is at home or on your uncles vegetable farm. This was restaurant week stop #2 - the best of the three I attended (Acadiana coming in a close second, Vidalia a distant third). For my starter, I had a tomato-based salad which was excellent (they have a wonderful basil-infused olive oil that is the color of asparagus-tinted urine that decorates the plate). My companion had two humongous lightly fried spring rolls that looked like plantains (or giant turds) and tasted light and airy. Yum. OK - I apologize for the toilet analogies - we really were off to a great start. I ordered the lamb sirloin and he ordered the steak. Ive had the softshell crab before which was nice, but lamb was calling my name. You know that the meat is going to be good when they bring you a normal butter knife to cut it. And a butter knife was all that was needed. Succulent, moist, and wonderful, accompanied by perfectly cooked green beans and creamy mashed potatoes. For dessert, the server talked me into the hazelnut bars--only available a few times a year--and they were rich and fantastic. My friend had the creme brulee and liked it too. The portions are hearty and the food stunning. Even though I didnt get it this time - get the tomato soup. Please. Then write me and tell me how much I rock for suggesting it. To top it all off, the service is spectacular. The servers know the food like the back of their hand and are perfectly willing and able to make suggestions. But let me tell you a story from one year ago that illustrates their service well...I had two dates with this guy, well call him Ryan (Ive never dated a Ryan). I invited him to go to restaurant week with me. He emailed me back agreeing to meet me at 12:00 at Corduroy. He didnt show. I called him at 12:15. No answer. He never showed. What happened? He had emailed me to see if I could do 1:00 instead because he had a haircut he forgot about--but the email went into my bulk mail filter and I never saw it. He didnt hear back from me so he figured it was off. By the time he got my voice mail it was 3:00 and he was feeling rueful. So I order at 12:15 just for me. The server knows that Ive been stood up. He doesnt care. He doesnt mind at all that theres one person ordering a measly $20 restaurant week meal with no alcohol. He is just tickled to serve me. He smiles, hes attentive, his suggestions are wonderful, he takes care of me as well as any other server has in my life. I had a great meal and left the place beaming--and left him a $15 tip, more than he would have gotten from the two of us. He was that good. I heart Corduroy., I had hear very good things about Corduroy and was impressed with the experience. The service was prompt yet unobtrusive, the way it should be always. The Filipino spring rolls were excellent if a little oily. Perfectly seasoned. The goat cheese with crispy potato was rich but well executed. The flat iron steak had a slightly unpleasant charcoal taste and the fries were mediocre and slightly undercooked. The roasted chicken was succulent and the braised cabbage was as good as can be done. The chocolate tart with honey ice cream and bananas was divine. The tart was rich with dark chocolate but had a delightful light texture. The peach and blackberry sorbets were well executed if unremarkable. Overall it was very well done and unpretentious cooking. One of the better establishments in the city., I came here for restaurant week and overall enjoyed the experience. Im usually quite skeptical of hotel restaurants but I would definitely give this more kudos then your typical hotel restaurant. The decor isnt anything special. And I was a little surprised at how many empty tables there were for restaurant week but then again, I dont know if everyone knows about this place. Our table was ready and waiting for us and for the most part, our waittress was extremely helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. She didnt push the dishes with upcharges, she pushed the ones she really liked. I had the carrot, beet, and goat cheese salad to start which was a surprisingly excellent combo of flavors. I followed that up with their famous scallops which were cooked to perfection. By the time it came to dessert, I was stuffed! So with my filled tummy and our missing waittress (seems to happen to me a lot: the-disappearing-waittress-just-before-dessert act as I like to call it), I barely touched my local blueberry tart with caramel ice cream. But what I had of it was good. So all in all, a good experience., I am not often moved to rave about a place, but Corduroy is definitely a special case. I went here for Restaurant Week (dinner), and I was impressed enough to want to return here for non-Restaurant Week times. First off, Corduroy offers its entire menu for Restaurant Week, with only a few upcharges, which is a real treat. But most importantly, the food here is phenomenal! Corduroy is not about fancy haute cuisine or experimental fusion food, but delivers solid American cuisine, prepared to perfection. I had the beet salad, the lamb and sorbet for dessert. Everything was simply delicious, and I really dont know how else to convey it except you must try it for yourself. Restaurant Week is an excellent opportunity and I highly recommend you try it. Service was friendly, but not intrusive. My only quibble is that its a tad on the slow side for me, with our dinner for four taking a little over two hours, but if youre the type who enjoys a leisurely dinner, rest assured, you will never feel rushed at Corduroy. Go! You wont regret it.p.s. my friend had repeated mouth orgasms. Yes, it was that good., Ill quote what my husband keeps repeating when he talks about Corduroy: Pound for pound, the most underrated restaurant in DC. Im not sure why he always adds in the pound for pound part - I swear he says that EVERY time - but I agree that I dont hear nearly enough hype about Corduroy. Maybe its because its in a hotel? (And thus, lacking in interesting decor?) I dont know, but this was one of the best meals I had in DC; and Ill definitely return.The menu changes, but if tomatoes are in season, definitely get the local tomato salad or tomato soup. We had one of each, and both were excellent. On our servers recommendation, I tried the roast whole baby chicken. I dont typically order chicken in restaurants, but when its done right, its excellent. Here, it was definitely done right. I was dying to try the big eye tuna, but thatll have to be saved for next time.We went during restaurant week, and my dessert was some kind of cookie wafer which I LOVED. It was like a Kit Kat classed up, and I was told its not normally on the menu. I hope they make it a regular, as I plan to be a Corduroy regular too. The service was perfect, and the food and wine were divine. Go, but - shhh! Lets keep this treasure hidden so those of us in the know can continue to enjoy it as its meant to be., 3.5 starsWhy is Corduroy so dead on a weeknight? Is it because it situated in a drab hotel? Who knows. I do know that if you go, get a cocktail, order the beet salad, an entree of your choice, and then get the chocolate tart with baked bananas. The food for sure, gets at least 4 stars; they come out in perfect proportions and nothing is terribly exotic.The service and ambiance gets less than 4 stars. The service was slooow, even for dinner. We sat there forever between the appetizer and main courses. It hard to describe the atmosphere, other than that there is no glow. The restaurant was dim, and despite the clean, earth-toned deco, everything felt very septic. Of course, the fact that the dinner was more business rather than pleasure probably colored my mood. I would love to go back for happy hour (they have a very reasonable HH menu at the bar) and see if there any fun in this place., 4.5 stars. The new Corduroy is fresh and hip and makes me happy. I loved the old Corduroy but didn understand why it was located in such a dreary, lame hotel. Now, Corduroy owns its own little house and has lots of space and is in the uber-chic Chinatown/Gallery Place neighborhood. Good move!I went to Corduroy the night before having all four of my wisdom teeth out so you KNOW I was down for a fabulous meal. I had the Salad Of Beets, Baby Carrots and Goat Cheese and then the Wild Ivory King Salmon with Sushi Rice and Hijiki. Both dishes were light but filling and very delicious. Perfectly cooked salmon. My parents and boyfriend enjoyed: Peekytoe Crab and Egg Custard Soup, Pan Roasted Muscovy Duck with Fig Sauce, Seared Barnegat Light Sea Scallops with Shiitake Rice Porridge, and Crispy Soft Shell Crab with Verjus. Everyone was pleased and my father (a total foodie) was DELIGHTED to see Muscovy Duck on the menu because, apparently, that is not readily available in most restaurants. BF asked for his duck to be cooked medium but it came slightly undercooked. The waiter offered him a whole new duck plate but BF declined and ate it. (Dad ordered his duck rare and loved it.)Dad also had a fun time with the waiter choosing different wines and champagnes. They were like pigs in sh*t going through the whole 4-page wine list. Dad seemed very impressed. Dessert was equally pleasing with Local Blueberry Tart with Blueberry Creamsicle, Flourless Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream, and a selection of fresh fruit sorbets. Expensive dinner ($533) but we had several bottles of wine and champagne (I LOVE when Mom and Dad visit!!!) The service was very impressive (our waiter was super attentive) and the new decor is lovely. Well done Corduroy!!, Oh my gosh. So much deliciousness. Eating dinner here motivated me to sign up for a yelp account just so I can rave about this place. The new location is great - the decor is elegant and I love that you can see directly into the kitchen and see the Chef at work. And the food, ah the food. I had the special lobster salad to start - it tasted fresh, perfectly made, and even the tomato was incredible (I hate tomatoes generally). I then had the Rare Tuna with Sushi Rice and Hijiki. AMAZING. I cleaned my plate. For dessert I had the chocolate sabayon with mint ice cream and it was perfectly done - you could really taste the freshness of the mint in the mint ice cream. Overall, I adored it and would definately recommend it to all. Make a reservation and go!, LOVE THIS PLACE. Finally Corduroy has it own home and it beautiful and a long time coming!!! I give the chef/owner props for the location - 1122 9th St., right across from the Washington Convention Center - not the prettiest block. I assuming they got a sweet deal on rent. The 2nd floor where the bar and private dining are located is a relaxing spot.Jerome and I were there 8 months ago and we were welcomed back by the same waiter, Pete! Such a pleasant guy. We love Corduroy because we are always pleasantly surprised. Cocktail to start: Forgot what this oh-so refreshing selection is called, but it with Henrik Gin (SO SMOOTH, THE BEST) fresh cucumber puree and thyme & Jerome got the mojito with Thai basil, so it not as sweet as your typical mojito but great flavor and fantastic twist on this classic drink! For the first course I had the Peekytoe Crab and Egg Custard soup - It definitely more of a custard as it steamed for about 15 mins. My mom used to make me a soup similar to this (minus the crab) when I was little, so course #1 was nostalgic and warmed me up. Course #2, was going for a similar entree with Corduroy Ahi Tuna, but they were out!!!! Therefore, I tried the Pan Seared Fluke with Warm Potato Salad - AMAZING. The fluke is a similar texture to sole. The parsley lemon butter sauce was to die for, so light & subtle. DESSERT: Got the blueberry tart with blueberry creamsicle. Delicious. The style of tart is more French style where there a slight bit of custard in the filling and ITS NOT SWEET!!!! The blueberry creamsicle was more strawberry, but that okay. Once again I scarfed it down within a minute.Dress code: ladies if youe without sleeves, please bring something to warm you up a bit as it chilly (the hostess even told me do so and thank goodness I listened for once.Can wait to come back in 6-8 months. Definitely check it out!!!!, My parents took me here for my birthday. It was a Saturday night and the place was completely dead.I dont know what happened, but the new location had really changed the experience. It isnt in a hotel anymore, but the ambiance is more like a mortuary with the servers (in suits) look like pall bearers waiting to take you away.The food was okay - nothing out of this world. It was mostly creative. I had the peeky toe crab soup to start. Mom had the Wagu beef special and dad had the lobster carpacio. The lobster was by far the best. Im still trying to figure out what is so great about the wagu beef - Im not a fan.My entree was the tuna steak - pretty good, but Ive had better. For dessert we had the chocolate zabiyone. Overall, it was a happy birthday because I had good company, but I wont be going back to Corduroy., Went here for our anniversary dinner. Thought the decor and ambiance were par for the course as more modern upscale restaurants go. Service was good, but not the best weve seen. Food was also good. Solid execution if not very inventive. I had steak with lima beans and potatoes. Wife had scallops with polenta. Like I said, nothing really creative in terms of concept or palette, but we liked them. We saw Chef Power in the kitchen (which is open to the dining room), so we would have liked the option of a tasting menu, but none was to be found. All in all, wed say good choice for an upper-end dinner (abt. $170 for 3 course each, cocktails but no wine), although its not going to blow your mind., Recently made a quick reservation for dinner here. I called around 5:00 and they were very accommodating. We were able to swing by, grab a drink, and sit right down for dinner. The lemongrass ginger martini was very good. We also tried the tomato salad and a special soup appetizer. For entrees, I tasted both the tuna steak and the duck. All of the food was excellent. The decor is a little basic and the requirement of a jacket is a little old fashioned for my taste, but the food really makes up for the short comings in those areas. The service was top notch, as one would expect from a great restaurant. All in all, the experience was very solid, but I would say the food was really the only star., Absolutely fantastic. Thats really what it comes down to describing my experience at Corduroy. I went primarily based on the several great reviews on Yelp and this place sure lived up to its reputation. I was a little apprehensive about its location by the Convention Center at night. I walked right by it and didnt even recognize it at first. Once inside, however, it was a total different story. The restaurant is beautifully designed and very elegant. So far, so good. The meal was classic, all-American cuisine prepared and presented flawlessly. I started with the carpaccio of lobster which went down like butter (it actually had drawn butter on it) - heavenly. That was followed by my main course of prime beef sirloin which was cooked exquisitely. Im still salivating thinking about it. Perfect portions, perfect presentation, perfect taste.The service was top-notch. We arrived a tad early for our reservation and the friendly hostess was completely accomodating and seated us within two minutes - literally. Our server, Katt, couldnt have been better. She was warm, out-going and very knowledgable about everything on the menu. She also respected our space and allowed us to eat in peace and made her appearances exactly when we needed it. If you get the impression that this is a rave review, then youre absolutely correct. I have nothing but compliments for this upscale restaurant. Well, except for the questionable location. Id recommend this place in a heartbeat., I gave this 4 stars only because I not a fan of the food, but other than that it great. Corduroy is a great place...IF you know what youe getting into. I had no idea what American (New) cuisine was (my friend made the reservation) so the food didn totally satiate my palate. But it did look pretty! The service is also EXCELLENT - they even put on my coat for me! The interior is really appealing as well. I will admit the dessert (flourless chocolate cake) was delicious - but then again I love anything chocolate. In the end, check what theye serving that night, and if it looks good check it out. I might just be a picky eater, but most of the stuff on the menu is either a hit-or-miss. Other than that it great. Really close to the Mt. Vernon Sq/Convention Center Metro too. Also, it says dressy for attire...try to stick to that. I made the mistake of wearing jeans since I didn Yelp the place (oops!) but the people there are dressed pretty nicely. You don want to stick out like a sore thumb..., I ate at this place once back in 2003 or so. Despite the horrendous decor of the hotel and the restaurant in general, I was pleasantly surprised by the food. I dont remember the exact dish I had, but my friend and I nodded our heads in agreement that dinner was much better than we wouldve expected., Incredible. Took my wife here for our anniversary. We received careful attention from the wait staff and the three courses each had a distinct flavor without being overpowered by spice. Everything was perfect. I so rarely find a place like this in the D.C. region., My wife brought me here for my B-day a while back and, I gotta say, this place is one of the best in DC. She read that the chef was an alum of Richards kitchen so she thought we would really like it here.She was not wrong. After 15 years as a chef in the fine dining world, I really appreciate simple food done well. And this place hit the nail on the head. I had the strip steak with haricot verts and Lyonnaise potatoes. I dont think I have had a simple meal this well prepared in years. Everything was perfectly executed. And when it was time for dessert, I couldnt decide between the blueberry sorbet and the vanilla ice cream to top my tarte tatin, so the pastry chef just wrapped a quinelle of vanilla around the sorbet! And it all went particularly well with the snifter of Grand Marnier 100yr old! Overall, a fantastic dining experience. They also had a very impressive wine list. I was told the chef is an avid collector and has many selections that are not on the list. You just have to ask. If you are looking for food the way it used to be and a nice, smooth dinner, look no further. This place will fit the bill., Corduroy was fab! I ate there with some girlfriends last night and we enjoyed everything that we ordered. I recommend the lobster carpaccio, it was delish!, This was one of the best dining experiences that Ie had in DC. We were celebrating a birthday with our group. We started out at the bar upstairs. Their cocktail list is nice (about 5-6 specialty cocktails). One of our group had the Apricottish- a scotch based apricot cocktail with some ginger flavorings- it was fantastic and not too sweet or tart. Their wines by the glass are not typical Chardonnay, Cabernet, etc. choices but the bartender was helpful in decoding the names and recommending perfect choices. Our server was very down to earth and helpful. Even though the place is a fine dining establishment, it was not stuffy in the least, which is a hard fence to straddle, but they did it well. The decor is very clean and modern, yet comfy (clean lines, light wood, neutral accents). The corduroy fabric wine list is also a nice touch and reminder of the restaurant theme. I started with a mozzarella appetizer special which was awesome (extra soft mozzarella with greens). Another at our table had the sea urchin pasta for a first course which was great. it tasted like a gourmet version of Tuna Helper which although it may not sound like it, is a great compliment! Very unique flavor and well rounded dish. For an entree, I had the strip steak beef dish with rhubarb. The steak melted in my mouth. Others at the table had the venison and duck dishes and all were excellent! The rhubarb on the side of my steak was like a potato napoleon in structure and texture and was an excellent pairing with the steak. For desert, the table enjoyed a cheese plate (small but good- also, the cheese stands alone- no nuts or fruit accompany, so beware), the flour less chocolate cake with coconut ice cream (delicious!), and the Local Apple Tart Tatin (also excellent).Overall, this place was worth it and, in DC, that hard to come by. I would highly recommend this place for a special occasion or a great dining experience!, Corduroy has great food at a good price point. The menu is creative and I like the restaurant space. This would be the restaurant I would go back to when Im in DC., Definitely an Asian flair to this New American cuisine. The spot is intimately laid out across two floors, with an almost bamboo-like wooding adding to the Asian theme. Orchids dot the bar upstairs which offers great lighting and good seating options. The tables downstairs offer either a large window view out to the convention center across the street or a view into the chefs domain. Either way, youll have a pleasant view and not feel crowded in. Recommendation: reserve one of the booths for maximum privacy. Once you get past the pall-bearer waiters in dark American suits, youll be surprised at exactly how much they know about the dishes. I went with my pregnant wife and the waiter knew all about the dietary restrictions. He was able to deftly navigate the menu for us. I decided to try some atypical dishes from other Yelpers here. And since my wife and I exchanged dishes, Ill comment about everything:Sea Urchin PastaI agree it tastes a bit like hamburger helper upon first bite--but in a good way. Its a homemade fettucine with a salty fish taste in light red sauce. Overall very good. Lobster CarpaccioThough I hate mayonaisse, this dish didnt overload on the creamy stuff. It was light and refreshingSeared Sea BassThis was a recent update to the menu. It was a bit on the fishy side, but balanced well with a light brown sauce hinting of ginger and soy. Overall, not too salty and a good contrast to...Pork CheeksThe meat was so freakin tender you didnt need a knife. It was coupled with a white bean that helped balance out the strong, smokey flavored sauceMy wife went with the homemade vanilla ice cream, pear sorbet, and coconut ice cream. I sampled and the flavors were rich but not sweet. And the scoops were big enough for two people to share., Visited this past week based on the reviews on Yelp. Took my niece who lives in the district and a business partner. All of us loved it. The service is excellent (waiters dress in business suits, maybe because this is DC and everyone is, or wants to look like, a lawyer or politician). At the end of the meal our waiter not only asked whether we needed a cab (my niece did) but went outside and hailed one and held the door open for her. The food was very, very good. My appetizer of burrata was the only disappointment--small portion and a bit rubbery rather than creamy. The other appetizers were very good. My entree of seared tuna steak over sushi rice was one of the best tuna dishes Ive had. My nieces steak was very nice and my partners lamb looked excellent (although I did not try it). Not an attractive street, but the interior (apparently formerly a townhouse) was very attractive in an understated way. Definitely recommend this restaurant. PS: prices are reasonable for the type of food, service, and setting., Wow! The new space is so much nicer than the old hotel location its not even funny. So glad they moved as I was ready to write this place off and couldnt see what all the fuss was about because of the lame location. When going out to dinner with someone I understand the food should be the standout but at the same time if you have standout food and a standout dinning room to me thats a home run and the new location has both. Good simple food done to perfection pretty much sums up up this place. Nothing that inovative, but who cares when the chef nails the basics. I have to admit I had just eaten at INOX 3 nights before so I think that may have jadded me slightly as far as my thinking the menu wasnt too invovative.Ask for Kyle if youre the type of dinners that like to interact with the waiter and not just treat them like the hired help. Next Time I go back I want to have cocktails at the upstairs bar and maybe see if they have a bar menu and just hang up there, it looked to be a very sexy spot., I really liked Corduroy. The decor was modern yet comforting, the service was exceptional, the food was terrific, and Id definitely come back. Unfortunately, my girlfriend and I were unable to do vday together for reasons outside of our control and we decided to make last weekend our vday makeup weekend. I called Corduroy two weeks in advance to make the Saturday night reservations and explained to the hostess, Erin, why we were dining with them that night. After explaining to her our vday debacle, she had a great suggestion for me and said shed speak to the chef about putting together a special vday themed dessert for us. Perfect.We arrived a bit early on purpose so that we could spend some time decompressing before dinner at the bar. I had an Oban 14, neat, and it was a healthy pour... good sign. The bar area upstairs is a nice place to catch a drink, though I doubt Id come here if I wasnt dining here, merely becuase of where its located (across the street from the convention center). I gave my gf a rose when I picked her up that night, which she wanted to bring in with her to the restaurant. When we were seated the first thing the waiter asked was if she wanted a small vase to put the rose in so that it didnt start to die while we were eating. Wow. I was impressed. The vase they brought out was cute and unassuming, perfect for a single rose. Needless to say, service here is top notch.There are two rules you should follow when dining at Tom Powers Corduroy.  ALWAYS order a soup ALWAYS have someone order the scallops, no matter how theyre preparedThe pumpkin soup was fantastic, a must order if its still on the menu. Dont fret if its not there, if just means Mr. Powers has found something else hes into and that just means youll have to order that instead... dont be skurred, itll be tasty, I promise.We also had the Duck Leg and Egg salad. This is a MUST order. Holy deliciousness. Cut up duck prepared perfectly, with microgreens in a light dressing with a slight kick to it and an egg, over easy on top of it all (or maybe it was poached, I forget). So good.For entrees, we had the scallops in rice porridge and the whole dorade fish. Both were excellent and Id recommend them in a heartbeat. The scallops, my goodness what that man does with scallops is fantastic.I also had the Sazerac cocktail with orange bitters which was quite good.This place is a perfect date spot and I cant wait to go back and see what Mr. Powers has in store for us, Usually I would feel a little guilty dropping so much money for a meal but the food and service at Corduroy was well worth it. It actually is a bargain considering the nearly 3 hour dining experience we had here that was complete with a cocktail, wine, and three course meal and including tax and tip came out to be just over a benjamin a head. Note: their menu was 3 courses pri-fixe for $55.We each started out with a cocktail and the server poured it tableside. My pomegranite manhattan was good and really strong. My friends SOS which was a mango based one was really tasty and so was the Red Lemon cocktail. For first course, I had the pumpkin bisque which had foie gras and was garnished with some dried pumpkin and bacon bits. It was very rich and hearty and wasnt overwhelmingly sweet like most squash based soups. My buddies had the oysters on the half shell and those were amazing! I usually hate raw oysters, but this one was topped with some diced apple and some champagne. It wasnt too briny and tasted so cool and fresh. For my entree I had braised beef skirt steak which was good and then finished off the meal with some coconut, apple, and pear sherbets. Portions were all moderately sized and we went away comfortably full. I was a little wary about the service when we first walked in and the hostess was missing for about five minutes, but after that the service was spot on. Our server was always attentive, gave great recommendations, and really couldnt have been any better. He took pictures for us and even escorted us out when we were done. Id love to come back again., Took a tip from the Washingtonians top 100 and ordered food from the bar menu. What a steal. A friend and I each had a glass of wine, we shared a cheese plate (5 cheeses) and chicken with linguine. We paid $25 each to get to taste the glory of Tom Powers. Cheese plate was yum...a good variety. Chicken was perfectly cooked with a very salty sauce, but it worked., I keep coming back to this restaurant with different friends and the experience is the same every time-Phenomenal!! The tuna is the best I have ever had and the combo of flavors and sides make it so over the top! The service is always exceptional and they have some ver good exotic, different drinks. Expect to spend some time as they take their time serving you a delicious time.The decor is very modern and pleasant., Good food. Excellent wine selection. Interesting menu. Lovely decor. Good waiter. Shoddy host. He made us feel rotten from the moment we got in the door to when we left because a couple members of our party didnt show up on the Wednesday evening we went there. The food was not enough to erase that memory., Maaan, I really wanted to like this one. I went for my birthday, and if the service hadn been terrible this would have been a five star. We arrived on time for our rez, and were seated at the upstairs bar because our table needed one moment. At corduroy, one moment means forty-five minutes. Not once during the wait were we offered a drink. Not only that, the bar table we were sitting at was not bussed from the previous patrons. We ended up bussing it ourselves. Not Good.So we are eventually seated, but needed to wait 10-15 mins to look at a menu. I guess the hostess ran out. Strange. The drinks we ordered upstairs took about 15 minutes to make their way down from the bar. Odd. After we finished our main course, it took them 30 MINUTES to remove the dirty plate from in front of us. Throughout the meal we were really just like helpless babies who needed changing. The food, however, was outstanding. I had tuna tartar to start. It was simply seasoned, but the quail egg on top added a definite twist. For the second course I had lamb loin. It was really quite excellent. Tender, juicy, and the sauce was fabulous. I wish the service was better :(, Baby, youe come a long way. I first dined at Corduroy in 5 when it resided within the Sheraton downtown and got a chance to revisit on Friday. As expected, the atmosphere has gone from a zero to a ten. Housed in a historic townhouse right by the convention center, Corduroy now oozes class and comfort, instead of nada-ness. Our server was friendly - full of helpful descriptions about the menu (ma mere and I tend to inquire a lot before we order, so I speak from experience) and well paced, though one bummer was a major wait for our table. I almost ate my stiletto during the epic (and somewhat unapologetic) delay of game, though I will say the bar is a pretty nice place to sit in the meantime.This was a dinner out with fam, so I had a chance to shamelessly taste test my table selections. In terms of fab first courses, both the sea urchin pasta and burrata & arugula were splendid, but I fell hardest for the rouge vif d`temps (red pumpkin- didn know that existed, so glad I do now) soup. My seared scallops were phenomenal, though the the consistency of the maitake rice porridge they came in was a little baby foodish. The muscovy duck and braised wagyu skirt steak received raved reviews, but the winning dish of the evening was the peppered tuna on sushi rice. I return to this place just to have another taste of that- seriously, the stuff of dreams. Dessert was just OK- the pistachio bread pudding was pretty good, the chocolate tart with caramelized banana better and my apple tart tartin only so-so.Definitely a lovely experience as a whole, but if they add some sweet beats in the background, seat people on time and ramp up the dessert menu, Il happily give this hot spot a 5 the next time around., Went there for dinner and would give 4* for this restaurant.Restaurant is hard to find and is located in this up-and-coming area. But dont be discouraged by the outside because the inside is another world, lovely & slick.Had Duck Leg and Egg Salad for appe, Pan Roasted Whole Dorade for main and Baked Chocolate Sabayon for dessert. Wanted the Sea Urchin Pasta for appe, but wasnt available... no big deal.Duck Leg and Egg Salad: 7.5It was a poached duck egg with pulled duck confit meat. Delicious overall, but nothing special about it. Pan Roasted Whole Dorade - 9Love the presentation because they actually gave you the whole fish with bone, head and everything (the proper way to enjoy fish). Fish was fresh and flavor was delicate. Love the fact that chef didnt try to put too much herb to overpower the fish. Baked Chocolate Sabayon - 8.5Nice dish if you like chocolate.Service was outstanding. This is a must-visit in Washington and will definitely go back., Corduroy is the eighth track on Pearl Jam 1994 album.....Yes like Pearl Jam tune......CORDUROY is a sight unseen and unheard gem!!!!! I tired of Tom Power being in the middle of pack of DC great chefs.....he run CORDUROY for ten years and been on the scene for 20....HE IS FIRST TIER all of the way. Service, food and ambiance.....all FOUR STAR quality!!!!! Ate a quiet lunch there yesterday......started with the Filipino style spring rolls, 6 inches long and the tangy sweet sauce accompaning them made for a great pairing. Went with the Vande Rose Farms devoe pork chops with the fingerling potato salad......DIVINE and medium rare cooked to perfection as each succulent piece melted in my mouth. Finished with the incredible pistachio bread pudding with a dash of vanilla Delicious, Very elegant and modern with a great wine and cocktail selection, amazing bread and soup, and less than amazing meats.I had dinner here with my family and it was a good choice over all. The soft spoken waitress was pleasant and helpful with all of our questions. The menu is typical of a foodie restaurant and we had plenty of questions to help us decode the menu! Its not that hard to understand, but some of the sides and preparation descriptions left us scratching our heads.The bread, like I mentioned before was just amazing!! I am a huge bread fan, and this was some of the best I have had in a long time. I got what was basically a pumpkin soup (forgot what they called it) that was very good and had a little kick to it. For the main course I got the lamb loin which was just ok. The sides were good, but the meat itself was a little weird. They made sausage out of part of it, and I am not a big fan of sausage. The rest was just not to my liking. No biggie, Ill try something else next time.My boyfriend got the steak, marbled with fat...I guess he didnt hear the marbled w/ fat part and so he didnt like it too much. It was extremely fatty, not sure who likes steak like that...but we dont.Anyway, the ambiance was nice. This old row house has been gutted and modernized with warm woods, stone, and glass. I really like modern design that is done w/ earthy, expensive materials. It was really deserted in there...but it was a rainy Tuesday night. I really hope more restaurants and cool little shops open up along this street. The buildings are pretty, but in desperate need of renovation! This fancy restaurant sticks out of its boarded up block like a diamond., This is an amazing restaurant! From the time you walk into its almost secretive entrance to the lovely interior, to the staff, the cocktails and the meal, it is a treat! Dont be turned away by the outside or its location. I have now chosen Corduroy for two very important events and have yet to be disappointed. The staff makes you feel right at home, not too stuffy and were willing to serve anything we needed. The small bar tucked upstairs is nice too either before or after dinner., I love Corduroy. I think it is one of the best restaurants in D.C., and has the food to stand up to the hype. I love that its not a scenester place and its a little off the beaten path from other downtown restaurants. You should make reservations well in advance because they fill up fast. The service is great and the waitstaff take their jobs very seriously, and will usually remember you even if it has been a few months since you saw them. Their presentation is fun too, they do things like a red snapper carpaccio where they pour a very hot soup over it and it cooks it instantly in front of you, and a goat cheese salad that has a paper-thin layer of goat cheese across the entire surface of the plate with the salad on top. I have had beef and fish dishes here and they are always cooked perfectly., Kind, friendly, attentive service; delicious food; so-so atmosphere. The fiance brought me here for my birthday this past Monday, and we had a great time! I immediately noted how kind and sincere our server was - none of the pretension or condescension we receive sometimes as the youngest diners in a $$$ restaurant. He answered our questions about the menu like a champ, and we thoroughly enjoyed the way he avoided using the trite phrase, How is everything? Let see if I can remember what he said: How are you enjoying the flavors? And there was also, Would you like to treat yourself to something delicious? (for dessert). How could we resist?For our appetizers, the carpaccio of lobster with drawn butter looked totally weird, but it was delicious. Thin (and raw??) lobster shavings, butter and some other sauces/flavors covered my rectangle plate. A little too goopy for his taste, but I liked it. He got the wild mushroom blintz with garlic sauce, and I was totally jealous! It was like a mushroom egg roll, but in the best way possible. Awesome.For his entree, he ordered one of the specials that night: the faux rib-eye. Deliciously marbled, described our server. We never use the F-word (fat). And the steak really was beautifully marbled, soft, tender and full of flavor. And Corduroy medium-rare really is medium-rare.I ordered the peppered rare tuna on a bed of sushi rice. I figured, why not order the dish that they have displayed on the front page of their website? (check it out: corduroydc.com) I like how they maintained the Asianness of this dish by using soy sauce and ginger flavoring, but they didn over-do it at all. The tuna was absolutely fresh and seared perfectly.The dessert menu said that the baked chocolate sabayon took 15 minutes to prepare, so we decided to go with the one that might be worth the wait. And if youe a chocolate lover, you will LOVE this dessert! It came with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and little sugar cake thingies (dunno how to describe). A great mix of textures, temperatures, everything. YUM.The decor isn bad, but just nothing special. I still recommend this restaurant just because the food is so good and the service is so wonderful! Yay, Corduroy! Happy birthday to me!Some tips:- Jacket required- Sometimes valet parking- It a historical building, so it not handicap accessible, Im somewhat nervous about reviewing really nice (aka expensive) restaurants, because I dont have too much experience eating at them and dont have the palate of a foodie, but I took the S.O. to Corduroy for his birthday and had a very nice time. The location is kind of random, across from the Convention Center, on a street with a bunch of abandoned buildings. We missed it the first time we walked down the block. I liked the interior. It was rather sparse and modern, but somehow still retained the rowhouse feeling. Our server was very attentive, though not overly friendly. Heres what we got:First course: lobster salad & snapper soupMain: lamb & scallops with morelsDessert: strawberry tart with sorbetThe food was all excellent, though my scallops with morels definitely stood out as a favorite! The lobster salad which I tasted was also awesome. The lamb and snapper soup didnt WOW me quite as much. I ended up with a hefty bill for the night which, for the most part, was worth it., This place is in a real no-man land: on a deserted block of 9th Street, across from a side of the convention center. It all town-housey on the outside, and the signage is real discreet and easy to miss. But walk through the doors and youe suddenly in a super modern and sexy interior.Only fifteen tables in the whole place so (1) you need to plan ahead and make a reservation (con people, it not that hard when good food is at stake) and (2) the lack of crowds equates to intimacy and a general lack of background buzz (good for romance or catching up, but bad for Saturday-night groups looking for a gateway to nightlife).The service has been impeccable each time. Things happen, but you don notice who did them or when. That kind of discreet in-the-background efficiency is my favorite paradigm for service in an expensive restaurant.I a fan of dedicated cocktail menus, and Corduroy had maybe a half-dozen tempting choices. But I went off menu and ordered a French 75. It confused the server but thankfully not the bartender. Twas perfectly refreshing after a hot day.I saving the best for last in this review, and the reason for the four stars: the food. If straight-up American cuisine is your thing, and especially if someone else is paying, you have to check out Corduroy. Portions are satiating, neither heaping nor tons of white space. Winning dishes include lobster salad (three takers at my table last night) and the incredibly tender and moist duck. The only off note were the raw oysters: tiny and without all the fixins. And if the pastry chef is reading this: thank you, thank you, thank you for that flourless chocolate cake. The generous dusting of bitter chocolate powder demonstrated that you were trying to reach the true chocolate lovers. You found me!Corduroy is not a neighborhood place, and certainly not an everyday place. It a destination, and a place to go when you want to aim very high., Say corduroy!!! the waiter said as he knelt down to take a picture of us. All was smiles b/c we had an awesome dining experience. All of us nicely dressed feeling yelp elite worthy in this restaurant we called corduroy. So... here how it went down. $55 bones for a 3 course meal. Add one awesome cocktail for 10+ or so person. Ask for the waiters recommendation for a wine (adding about 15+ or so per person.) With tip included rounds some where about a benjamin.  There are three things that made this experience an awesome one. Company, the waiter who was very attentive,educational, calm, and... generally gave you a good welcome feeling about coming to their restarant. He even walked us out to the door.  As for the food, ha ha wasn sure if itwas the description of the server or the food... but something sure made it an awesome meal. I had what the chief had as his special for the day ... truthfully I forget what it was but just remember smiling about it. Well Corduroy... come for a not rushed, friendly, and settled dining experience. :), One of the most under-rated restaurants in DC. The classy American fare here sounds simple, but the dishes are infused with a dash of excitement and prime ingredients. Great for a special occasion, and very quaint. Corduroy is cozy and cold, better than I expected!, Corduroy hit all the right notes and except for a few small glitches more than met my expectations. I was sold on Corduroy by the red snapper bisque which yelpers and a few of my friends in the district raved about. Unfortunately though, on the night I was there they had substituted a corn and lobster chowder for the bisque on the menu. Disappointed, I decided to forgo an appetizer, but I did manage to snag a few bites of my friends chowder. It was quite good and while I would have preferred that the lobster was a little more pronounced, the chowder still very pleasant.For an entr39e I selected the scallops based on the recommendations here and my friend got the tuna. Neither one of us was disappointed. The scallops were well cooked and the morel mushrooms which accompanied were top-notch. However, while the scallops were good, I actually ended up preferring my friends tuna. The fish was served on a bed of sushi rice and was unbelievably well-cooked. Seriously. It may be the best tuna that has ever passed my lips. For dessert we got a chocolate souffl39 of sorts (it was called a sabayon on the menu, but the waitress ceded to me that it was more of a souffl39 than a sabayon) which was very very nice. It was generously sized to boot, which made for easy sharing between the two of us.Corduroy is on the cusp on five stars but it does have a few issues to grapple with:1. The drinks are (very) weak and pretty overpriced. I elected to go with the St. Germain 75, and while it tasted alright, it set me back $9 and failed to loosen my tongue even a smidgen. Corduroy should either get bigger glassware or lower the price of their cocktails by about $2 a piece. 2. The waitress never gave us a wine list. I wasnt planning on selecting any wine with my dinner so I didnt nag her about this but I thought that this oversight was a little strange for such a high caliber restaurant. 3. They never replenished the bread basket. Further, while the bread was adequate, it failed to wow me (it was simply slices of French bread--a little variety wouldnt hurt). Overall though Corduroy was a real treat. As someone who usually has more than a few complaints about the service, I was very impressed by the way their dining room was run. Hope I can put Corduroy through its paces again sometime soon., This was my second time back at Couduroy and it was even better than the first! The service was truly impressive. Kat was our server and didnt miss a trick! Professional, attentive and observant. She noticed us putting sea salt on our butter and then proceeded to bring us another pre-salted fresh batch. I know its small, but no one ever does that!!! She was also concerned with our thoughts with each dish she brought out. Her wine pairings and suggestions were spot on. The special red pumpkin soup was brilliant as well as the lamb. Great job!, Although by most accounts here on Corduroy Yelp page it deserves 4 stars, I have to give it 5. Ie been here twice and have been very happily satisfied with my experience, from the food to the service. I glad that it remained one of DC hidden gems so far and as much as I want this place to get lots of business, I like knowing that I can pop in without a reservation and be seated immediately. Ie dined at Corduroy in the main dining room and at its upstairs bar for their pre-fixe menu; each dish that I tried on both occasions was both unique and delicious. Their tuna tartare is a bit on the creamy side, but it a refreshing start to a meal. Their Filipino-style eggrolls were pretty spot on with the pork and vegetable mixture filling and the sweet chili sauce - that brought me back to memories of home when my mom made them. As for main dishes, I love that this is a new-American, upscale restaurant that does not skimp on portions like similar restaurants do. The Pennsylvania lamb loin was the right amount of tenderness, and the sauce it accompanied with makes it taste so succulent. I push my vegetables around in the sauce before eating them, it was that good. The duck confit that they offer in the pre-fixe menu is equally tasty and fall-off-the-bone tender. Although Ie had desserts elsewhere that I enjoyed more, Corduroy manages to separate itself again with desserts like a chocolate sabayon, which pretty much resembled a souffle to me but was wonderfully rich and fluffy. The sorbets they offer are very flavorful - I had a flourless chocolate cake which didn wow me but I loved the coconut sorbet that it came with on the side. Corduroy quality extends to its service as well; our waitress was very kind and patiently answered my handful of questions about what exactly is this? what exactly is that? Hey, I like to know what I about to stuff my face with. The bartender upstairs was very friendly and hospitable - and makes awesome cocktails to boot., Years ago I let my now-ex boyfriend choose a place for dinner for his birthday. I was surprised when he took me to some random hotel restaurant. Where I come from, if the hotel has a restaurant, it is awful and consists of a buffet and a steak special. Well, we came here and got the steak special. And wow, it was perfect. The sides were perfect. The service was perfect. Dont be put off my the location of this place, it is one of the nicest restaurants in town., Great food and atmosphere. Sophisticated food that is satisfying. Make sure to try the $30 three course bar menu while it lasts., This place is wonderful. Chef Tom Power takes such good care of his diners. We came here for our anniversary after many recommendations and we were not disappointed. The service, from the minute we walked in the door, was perfect. We felt like such VIPs. The wine list is extensive, and accessible. The wait staff are very knowledgeable and we felt okay asking questions. We also had a semi-private table. It looked like there were a few little nooks just for couples, which we really appreciated.Corduroy is a diamond in the rough--dont be put off by its location. 9th St. is changing rapidly. Theres nothing to be afraid of around there.
17|dbgb-kitchen-and-bar-washington|I was a little skeptical but man was I wrong this place is awesome. From the service to the selections and the desserts. Baked Alaska anyone? Souffles? I ordered the Crab persillade, foie terrine and the chop chop salad to start. Amazingly everything was perfectly seasoned nothing came salty.For entrees I had the linguini du sud, fried chicken and basque and boudin blanc.I have to say come back for the burgers and eat some saucisson. This place has the best lightest boudin blanc. The blood sausage makes me drool with anticipation for next times meal. Minerally and chucks with the blood to make that rich mouth feel. Delicious.FInished with the Baked Alaska and also the souffle. If this is the start of the NYC Chef invasion then I embrace with open arms. Cocktails were spot on order some vespers with a splash of extra lillet. Perfect.Will be here again soon!Cheers and happy eats, This weekend was the opening weekend for DBGB -- Daniel Boulud first restaurant in DC -- and I somehow very easily scored reservations for Saturday evening.We arrived a tad early so we had some cocktails at the bar while waiting for the last person of our party to arrive. To my surprise, one of the bartenders was a friend from another highly rated DC restaurant - so fun! The bar area is bright and lively with lots of windows and mirrors and stuff written on them. There also a combo of bar stools and bar benches so you know, youl want to be on that bench with someone you like. We were soon seated at our table; a cozy booth along the wall, next to the shelves of books, various ingredients used in the restaurant, and the celebrity chef plates. One of my friends and I were excited to be sitting under the Jacques P39pin plate. Among the more famous of chefs, there were also some local names such as Haidar Karoum and Bryan Voltaggio. We had a plethora of people come by our table before we even came close to placing our order so for a bit, we couldn really tell who our server was. One person asked for our water preference, a different person delivered it, someone else brought us bread and butter and then another person inquired about anything else to drink. Oh, and going back to the bread basket -- it was a tin full of pretzel buns, lavash and sliced bread. I loved that the round of butter was served with sea salt atop a slate slab. This kind of stuff will always win me over.We finally settled on sharing a few things to start -- the rillons croustillants ($14) - which were basically braised, then fried pork belly bites, the tuna crudo ($18) and a duo of sausages ($25) which were the tunisienne and the beaujolaise. We felt it was necessary to try the sausages since there was a whole boxed section of the menu devoted to them. Prior to our apps coming out, we were sent a gratis order of beer battered crispy calamari. We were pleased with our choices -- every bite was delicious. The pork belly were delightfully crisp and yet didn feel too fatty. The tuna was a light, fresh option which had a harissa-sesame sauce that helped kick up the spice while the watermelon in the dish cooled it back down. It was also beautifully presented. The tunisienne was a lamb & mint merguez sausage with dots of harissa on the plate and spinach and chickpeas. It was pretty tasty but of the two we ordered, I think I preferred the beaujolaise. For entrees, our table had 2 orders of the fried chicken ($26), the coq au vin ($29) and the trout ($28). Both plates of the fried chicken mysteriously arrived without the much hyped DBQ sauce so we had to inquire about that - but honestly, after sampling a bite of the chicken, it was so crisp and juicy that I think it could actually stand alone without it. The coq au vin was served with leg and thigh meat in a deep, rich wine sauce and some sp34tzle. The meat was perfectly tender and easily fell off the bone. The trout was wrapped in pancetta and seemed to disappear quickly from my friend plate. I say a quarter of the way through our entrees, I spotted DANIEL himself and transformed into a dorky fangirl! I (discreetly) started squeaking, It him! It him! It him! He here! He here! Give me celebrity chefs any day of the week and I will lose my cool and forget what words are. Give me movie stars and tv stars (well, except Chris Pine, obviously!) and I won care. But chefs/celebrity chefs are what I geek out over. So you can imagine how cool our foursome foodie table reacted once he came over to our table to chat. I honestly can even remember what I said to him but in my head I was losing my shit for sure. I met Daniel Boulud. Sigh.For dessert, we shared the souffl39 and the rocky road profiterole. I was actually really full at this point but we trudged on. The souffle was gorgeous. It was light and airy and had the height that a perfect souffle should have. The profiterole was confusing. We were presented with a chocolate dome and edible gold. We thought it was the wrong dessert UNTIL he poured hot melty chocolate over the dome and then the middle of the dome melted and gave way to a single, giant, delicious cardamom ice cream filled profiterole. Oh yes. Overall, I say DBGB had it together quite well for an opening weekend. Our server (once we figured out who it was) was so sweet and very accommodating to us. She helped guide us through the menu giving spot-on recommendations while not being pushy. And food came out quickly, drinks were constantly filled and refilled; plates cleared and silverware replenished. Welcome to DC, Chef Boulud. Hope to see more of you soon!, The service was decent. The servers were clearly over worked, but did an adequate job of accommodating. Our server had six tables on a Tuesday night. The industry standard for a high scale restaurant is generally three tables per server. Not here, though. I haven waited tables for over a decade, but I still know that is true.The restaurant was also over booked on OpenTable, but when we arrived for our 6:45 p.m. reservation (the only one available before 9 p.m.), most of the tables were still open. This made sense to us. No reason to overwork a new kitchen or wait staff. That didn seem to be the reason as the night went on. Tables were overrun around 8:00 p.m. and there was no seating pattern. Everything was just over crowded at once.The food was fine. Bread was nice, apps were okay but small, and the main portion was served quickly after the second portion was finished. All portions are incredibly small, though. Wine glass pours are 5 oz., and the bottles are overpriced for the cheap selection (I would still recommend ordering a bottle over the short pour for glasses). Everyone enjoyed the cocktails before dinner service.Our servers had good knowledge of the menu, but were not quick to return to our table after each visit, even if we were still waiting to place orders. They were clearly over worked. The manager, whose name we eventually learned was Dominic, did nothing to accommodate. During the entire time we were there, he visited one table four times. The male patron at that table clearly knew him personally, as he patted the manager on the shoulder as they were seated and laughed with each other each time he checked up on him. Meanwhile, Dominic ignored the rest of the tables in the dinning area. He let his servers sprint from table to table without care and without checking up on any of them. He appeared every couple of minutes from the kitchen to look upon the dinning area but never to ask anyone about their service or food.Once we received our check, I asked our server how many tables he was responsible. He told me six, and I asked him where the manager was at that time. Surprise, he was standing right behind our table overlooking the room but paying no attention to anyone. The server tapped him on the shoulder and said this is Dominic. Dominic glanced at us and then turned his head away.I feel for our server and the supporting staff. They are being underserved by such awful management. I would expect high turnover in the coming weeks. There will always be kinks to work out for such a new location, but the management should be bending over backward to support the wait staff and customers during the fist weeks. Whomever owns this chain should look into the management they hired and make adjustments. We will not be returning until there are adjustments made., This past weekend my Instagram / Feedly feed was filled with celebratory exclamations about DBGB Kitchens opening in City Center. My interest was piqued so after attending the Del Friscos opening across the way, I decided to save some room for drinks and a bite or two.We sauntered in around 9 pm and the place was packed to the brims. No table was in sight for at least another hour so we decided to high tail it to the bar where we luckily got two seats right next to each other (thats stealth skills right there!).A cocktail list was presented to us quickly so I got the Gingered Scotsman which is was a blend of Hendricks and other yummies, flanked by some beautiful candied ginger. It was a bit sweeter than I expected but delicious.The boy ordered an Old Fashioned and was surprised to see that it was served without any ice cubes. Usually we are used to drinks served with giant spherical cubes or hand picked cubes but this was just shaken till it was cold and served in a glass (not a complaint, just an observation...and surprisingly it did stay cold).Honestly, looking through the menu there was nothing too much that really stuck out to me that looked truly mouthwatering so I haphazerdly chose the rillons croustillants, linguini du sud (app version), and french fries to share.The rillons croustillants aka pork belly or aka lechon kawali to my fellow Pinoys out there was absolute perfection. Crispy skin, good meat to fat ratio and not greasy at all. As someone who has eaten pork belly her whole life, it is easy to get a headache from all the grease and fat that comes along with consuming this dish. This was not the case at all.The linguini du sud was such a simple dish. Very rustic and something that I would make at home. The pasta was the perfect al dente and I loved the clean taste of the lemon and arugula. That being said, it wasnt exactly flavor town (especially after that pork belly) but for somebody looking for simple perfection, this is a wonderful choice. French fries are what you expect, they were served in a cone and cut shoestring skinny and extra crispy.Service was definitely harried since the restaurant was poppin but they were efficient. A vibrant atmosphere that kind of reminds me of Le Diplomate when they first opened.Ill be back for a table seat! Bar seats for girls under 52 are the worst!!!, My two friends and I went to this restaurant on Tuesday of opening week. This restaurant is very high power DC - think lobbyists, lawyers, etc. Everyones suited up and the after work crowd is high in effect. We couldnt get a table in the main seating area, but we were able to secure bar seats fairly quickly and eventually a bar table. The server was friendly and helpful. My wine by the glass was delicious. My two gripes with this place was the food as a vegetarian and the bill. I know my expectations of vegetarian food in a French/American restaurant should not be high. But there are many high end restaurants in the City that accommodate vegetarians with really delicious options. I had two dishes: a chopped salad which was literally lettuce and an eggplant dish which was really a few pieces of cooked eggplant in a yogurt sauce. Neither were memorable or delicious or filling. My second issue was the bill. We had asked the bar to transfer the bill to the table. At the end of the evening, they had forgot to add the drinks to the table. In realizing this, we decided to be honest and tell our server. They should have waived the expense (or at least taken care of it quickly), but instead it took them another 30 mins for them to send over the additional bill for the drinks. This restaurant is new, so I understand growing pains. But, in its newness, it should extend some courtesy if it wants to keep its customers., Alex B was an amazing server and knew his stuff! Youll be lucky to get him! Great food and drinks here!, The consensus at our table was that the food was pretty good, but certainly none of the wow factor wed seen at Bolouds New York restaurants. The service was appallingly bad. Chalk it up to early days? Lets hope so. We had to ask more than once for a second menu, and more than once for someone who knew something about the wines. We were offered desert menus as soon as wed finished our starters. Wont make a special effort to visit again., Cyndys Bottom Line: a celebrity chef driven restaurant that is overhyped, overpriced and under delivers. We were so excited to get a reservation here. The host greeted us and took us to the worst table in the entire restaurant. The table was located in a corner in the bar (despite a plethora of open tables) where there was a big black unexposed vent above blowing cold air on your head and scalp. Nice. Not. So we moved ourselves two tables in to avoid the big vent blower. This is the start of the game of musical tables. Fun and entertaining. There were (5) couples that they tried to seat at the wind blown table to no avail. 5 stars for not giving up; 1 star for powers of hostess observation.Meanwhile, this is what we drank:A flute of the Champalou brut champagne which arrived flat with no effervescence. I brought it to the attention of the waiter and it was replaced promptly by the bartender. A decently made Redemption Rye Manhattan for hubby.This is what we ate:The complimentary lavosh was good and we loved the butter.RILLONS CROUSTILLANTS: crispy and tender pork belly, dijon mustard, cracked pepper. The pork was crispy but there was too much fat on it. The fris39e cut the fattiness of the pork. Was the mustard house made or was it out of the bottle? Enquiring minds want to know.BOUDIN BLANC: truffled pork sausage, apple, pommes mousseline. The housemade sausages are the specialty here. The truffle was mild not to over power the pork but in the end the sausage was without taste and texture was blah.LINGUINI DU SUD: lemon-saffron pasta, sepia, shaved bottarga, wilted arugula. The pasta was served al dente which was good. It was a thicker cut and slightly chewy. The cockles were cooked well.TRUITE AU LARD ET SAUGE: pancetta-wrapped river trout, sage, oyster mushrooms, potato 39cras39. Well boned and cooked but something which should have had a rich fish taste augmented by the saltiness of pancetta was strangely flaccid.We surrendered to the ennui of the food and chose elsewhere for dessert., The restaurant is in my neighborhood and I was really excited to try it, especially since Ive been looking forward to the opening of this restaurant and I love French food. We were also celebrating a special occasion. But, sadly, I was disappointed. We arrived and had a reservation, but the server acted like they werent expecting us and took us to a table that was not in a desirable location in the restaurant (back room in the middle) with place settings for 4 when it just the 2 of us. We asked for a booth and that took a little while, even though the restaurant was not full. We sat in the booth and found that the air vents were blasting onto our seats - we were both cold during the entire meal. Apparently they are having problems with the ventilation. Clearly, this is a new restaurant that is still figuring things out, which is understandable. Other than that, the service from the waiter and the servers was excellent. The appetizers (the pate de champagne and the wonderful sausage boudin blanc) were very good and I would highly recommend the boudin blanc. For the main dishes, the Frenchie burger was fabulous but the Coq Au Vin was ok. By this time, we were too full for dessert. I definitely want to come back one more time when they have the Whole Hog Meals and to try the Baked Alaska. Right now, I think they are a new restaurant in the DC area (I understand they have other restaurants elsewhere) figuring stuff out. Im hoping they can bring things up to par with Le Diplomate., I was surprised to be able to book a table at DBGB last week. We looked forward to check it out. It was a gloomy and rainy day but walking into DBGB it was a contrast with the warm and casual atmosphere. We arrived early but were able to get seated. The table though very narrow we were squeezed between two table in close proximity. People were talking loudly as usual. Sometimes I wish they had a quiet section and a loud mouth section in restaurants. However that would probably be 90% of the restaurant haha. We were drawn to all the plates on displayed painted in various designs bearing various chefsnames. My husband asked if we might meet Daniel Boulud I was like, naw it probably only for the opening week.We ordered a couple glasses of wine, a rose and cab franc they were pricey but average in taste. The menu was somewhat safe with a variety of French classics. For starters we had the crunchy egg with anchovade and rabes, the charred rabe had good flavors but was a bit stringy either eat it whole or cut it with a knife. The egg was cooked perfectly the crunchy outer layer was good and the runny yolk was divine! We loved the anchovade it was just perfect for the dish. The next dish was the escargot with chicken fricassee, it was served in a green sauce that was slightly acidic. I took a fork of the escargot and chicken swerved in around the sauce it was good. The chicken alone was a little over salted for me. My husband liked it. The next dish was the boudin blanc served with a creamy potato puree and apples. The boudin was soft and light with bits of black truffles. We loved the potato puree it was probably many hundred calories but well executed. The next dish was the fried chicken. It was very crunchy outside but very very moist inside it was a mouthwatering experience. The last dish was the beef tartare it was probably hand cut into small pieces the tartare was also well made, not overwhelmed with Worcestershire sauce or Tabasco sauce. It did not come with fries so I ordered a side but it took awhile. The shoestring fries were good.Anyhow, after our first three plates, there was a sudden silence. It was the appearance of Chef Boulud everyone quiet down and started back up again. We were surprised to see him he went around the tables to say hello. That was cool. When he made his rounds we managed to catch his attention even though our table was in the middle we didnt know what to expect. We had a candid chat about the embassy life in DC (he was the chef of the French Ambassador to the EU) and Lyon, he jumped and asked if we saw the episode of Anthony Bourdain show about Lyon. He said it was fun but a lot of work. He was very approachable and normal. We enjoyed chatting with him and hope to check out Daniel in NYC., I tried to keep my expectations low before meeting a friend for dinner here. Its new, so there would be some kinks to work out. Maybe it would be slow service, or any number of things that would make a great new restaurant not-so-great. DBGB had none of those issues. We came relatively early, so we were seated right away. The noise level grew a little throughout the evening, but it was never too much. My friend ordered a glass of wine, I had the rye whiskey cocktail, which was spicy, sweet, and smooth. A great compliment to the dinner. My vegetarian friend went off the menu for dinner, and the chef whipped up a pasta with fresh vegetables that she simply RAVED about, declaring she had never had such a quality pasta dish. The waiter suggest the Coq Au Vin, and when the namesake chef is the king of Lyon, you dont say no to that. Im glad I didnt. This Coq Au Vin was one of the top five things Ive ever put in my mouth. The rich sauce, perfectly tender chicken, bacon, and mushrooms made me weak in the knees. (Yes, I was sitting, just go with it.) It was so incredible. It came with a spaetzle-style noodle that soaked all of the goodness up from the bottom of the bowl.We finished with the Baked Alaska, filled with incredible house-made pistachio and vanilla ice creams and a raspberry sorbet that made your mouth water. (And the tableside ignition was a nice show!)You should absolutely go here. Dont let the hype get in the way of the food. Go, eat, enjoy. Ill be back!, We ordered The Frenchie burger and the Atlantic Salmon. The Frenchie burger was good but the fries were horrible! They were extremely salty. Even McDonalds dont make them this salty! The salmon was okay but wasnt a fan of the olives, just a personal preference. Also ordered two cocktails and they werent that good. We sat up at the bar and the service was sloppy from the girl bartender. I expected more from the NY chef., Ok so I went here last night for my first time. I was excited to check out this new restuarant in City Center DC after hearing all the hype about it.Our reservation was for 10pm on a friday night so not the busiest time.The restuarant wasn busy so we got seated right away. We then tried to order some cocktails. It was at this moment that I was first dissapointed by this place. We tried to order 3 different cocktails and the waitress said they were out of them. HOW CAN YOU BE OUT OF DRINKS ?Considering they are a new restuarant and it a Friday night you would think they would be better prepared. SO not only were they out of 3 differentdrinks but it took us over 30 min to get our drinks. Then the drinks arrive and it the smallest martini glass I have ever seen in my life. By this point I was already disgusted by the service and my experience here.SO then I thinkin maybe the hype is all about their food so I gonna be patient and hope they will change my mind.We ordered about 5 different small bites and appz and we thought we ordered a lot. Their portion sizes were way too small. they weren joking when they said SMALL BITES. But I wouldn be so upset about the portions being too small if they weren $15 each and tasted amazing but it was just mediocore and over priced. At this point we didn even bother to order any meals and decided we would never come back to this place.My expectations were too high for a new restuarant coming from NYC to City Center DC and they definitely didn live up to their name., It was a cool, sunny Autumn Sunday in the District, parking spaces non-existent along five square block radius, requiring over the top parking lot event parking rate. Two hungry people ready for Sunday Brunch.The Good: got a reservation (too) easily...hmmm. Elixir cocktails were mighty tasty. The Tuna Crudo harissa sauce had a nice punch, but overall the dish was, well, see below. Beaujolaise with two scrambled eggs was very tasty. Given the chefs of the District penchant for over salting everything, we were very surprised the sausage was in fact not over salty. All in all a fine dish, and perhaps if we go back, we would go back for the sausages. Ouefs Forestiers was just ok, nothing spectacular, but nothing wrong. Two soft baked eggs with some shrooms, caramelized onions (though I felt like I was foraging in a forrest to find them in the dish). Not greasy, not salty, good, but forgetful. Bacon, as one rater noted, seemed on the pre-cooked, let to sit around until needed side. So, I also like the Belgian Waffles, despite the blueberry compote being a bit milly. The compote was on the tarter side, but the blueberries weren cooked out, and the compote was not overly sweet. I did not like, though, the cold maple syrup, which you will need to keep reading on. The bear face with bow tie in my cappuccino froth, was a smile educing moment.The Bad: Cold Syrup. Who the heck gives you cold syrup in a cold vessel for you to pour on your warm/hot waffles? Tsk, Tsk!!! The Tuna Crudo, although I liked the harissa sauce, the dish was overall a ho hum cliche, if not for the harissa. Small, non-uniformed chunks of rather tasteless tuna, with bits of grapefruit, some slices of radish and cucumber.The Ugly: The Tarte Flambee was unfortunately, and too literally, flambee--that is, burnt. Charred, burnt taste permeated the tarte, my drink, my teeth, my tongue, my everything. Unfortunate, since it would have been a very fine tarte if it had not been for being burnt. I must note the restaurant did not charge me for it, so Kudos for taking care of that nasty business. Now, let talk tarte, because a tarte has distinct connotations, and I not talking about the vixen my grandmother would call a tarte. Let just say this was a pretentiously titled tiny pizza.The Miserable: The bus folk were on their game, so good job to them. For the most part, the staff seemed friendly. Our waiter, on the other hand, was unfortunately absent and aloof. Not engaging, didn seem to care about anything, blah, blah, blah. Unfortunate, since as I looked around the room, other wait staff were attentive and engaging., Wish I could give 2.5 instead.Yea, previous post is unfortunately correct. The celebrity chef movement is sort of lost on the celebrity chef in this instance. It was just OK.Beautiful place, received a nice welcome at the hostess stand. Great looking bar, all the rest of the seating looked nice as well. (note to all restaurants: post more photos of your interior and fewer of your food. We want to see where wel be and what wel survey as we sit there.)Menu is shorter that I might have expected, but I understood that going in and there are certainly enough choices for everyone, although the menu I received was definitely shorter than the one online.It was all just.... fine. Nothing special in any of the dishes. Nobody uttered the words this is great. Burgers, sausages, fish, three starters - OK, only two starters, our server missed one and got another wrong. OK... fine... wel just go with the flow...Overall, in this instance it all about server training. Our service was inattentive. (wrong dishes, missed drinks, lacking a decent attitude) Once you have us there, you still need to make the sale about what dishes are great, what you like as a server, what is popular, etc. And then you need to be present when it delivered (and check to make sure we got what was ordered), and you need to check back to make sure we happy. It was all lacking and that also influenced this review. But again, the food was just average.Celebrity chefs (or not), you need to oversee your operations. Note to reversations: many tables open halfway through dinner, despite being told they were booked for that hour. Either the average reviews got to them before we arrived, or they were playing the wee so popular wee all booked game. Either way, not a good impression for a place that came with such hype., Fake Sommeliers and Waiters Drinking MY Wine in Corners on a Sunday Night...I had high expectations - and they were literally met with astonishing service/excuses and lying I have ever dealt with. First, excited to try this gem. Arrived on Sunday night with several good friends and my date, who had been to the flagship in NY. Upon arrival, the bartender was fun, outgoing and really made a great 15 minute experience while my date and I waited for the group to arrive - as we left him and were seated it all went downhill. Once seated we ordered a bottle of wine. The server presented it to the table, then he left.... with the wine. With some (significant) sleuthing, one of us spotted him in the corner, facing a wall and pouring himself 1/4 glass. Upon returning and knowing of his indulgence we promptly asked him how it was, and he made up some wine sounding words (earthy, hint of fruit etc.). Then he proceeded to pour the wine while splashing and spilling over the table - evidence that this likely wasn his first libation of the evening. When confronted about astingour wine, he said that the sommelier does it all the time, but since she wasn there he HAD to do it. I then asked to speak to the sommelier. Even though I was warned she wasn there several minutes ago, a woman presented herself as being the sommelier and covered for him saying, and I quote It a Snooty French thing we do, we do it all the time to make sure it tastes like it should to which I replied But the waiter mentioned he had never had this wine before; so how does he have any idea how it should taste? So, in conclusion, this was a case of a likely intoxicated waiter and a wanna be sommelier or a not-so-good sommelier (to be determined) turning work into a unday Funday.I don think I will come back and I won get into the food side of it, not even worth writing about., Excellent service, great food--loved the eggplant app. Great wine but small pours for the price. If not for that i would give this experience a solid 5 stars., I give this restaurant 2 stars. I was expecting a lot more from this restaurant, considering all the hype and the reviews of its NY location. For the price you pay, the service was not up to par, we had a group of 6 people and we waited a pretty long time ( in restaurant standard) for the waiter to bring us water and take our drink orders. During the time we places our drink order we had up to three waiters come by and none ask for our orders. Finally one asked for our meal orders and guest what, when the food came to our table, two of the orders were incorrect and incomplete. We had two people in our table without food for about 10 minutes, which is a no no for this kind of upscale dinning. Food was good but not great, I had better in other french-american restaurants. Hope they make some changes and improve service and quality. Ambiance is really nice and good for groups., Good Appetizers, Weak Entrees, and Average Service ($800) Like many other reviewers, this place was all hype and no follow through. The best thing I had was my drink, the Bumble in the Rye. At $13, it was the only thing worth the price. We had about 8 people and tasted a lot of the menu. The calamari was great with Thai flavors. The pork belly appetizer was rich and needed more frissee or something to cut the fat. The beef tartar was ok, a little heavy on the mustard. I didn try the oysters, but at $18 for 6 I was not impressed. So after our appetizers we waited a while for the entrees. And every single entree fell flat. The Coq Au Vin was burned and had an acrid char flavor to the whole dish. It looked nothing like the other pictures on this site, and the broth was almost black. The fried chicken was ok, needed salt, and all the sides were gross - mushy potato chucks and overdone greens with underdone bacon. The lamb chops ($48) didn taste like harissa and the fat was RAW and not rendered at all. My two sausages were actually pretty good. The Vermont with the cheddar was a little salty but the boudin blanc was pretty amazing. The texture was almost like a mousse. I enjoyed everything except the apples which seemed to be an afterthought and didn match the flavors. The Frenchie ($19) was no better than a shake shack burger and the fries were hard and cold. Throughout the night our server would disappear for long periods of time and was not fully familiar with the menu. They mixed up our food and brought out things that they didn even know what the were asking Did someone order a side of...something?. But he was friendly enough and dealt with too many credit cards and got us our check and receipts back quickly. I guess my biggest issue is that at $100 a head, I expected food that would be delicate and nuanced and have amazing flavor profiles. The calamari and the cocktails were delicious. Everything else was meh. Another typical addition to the DC food scene., After reading all of the reviews it was true the service is slow. The waiter did tell us to place our order for all of our courses. The Fall Squash Soup presentation was wonderful and was happily surprised the bowl was warm, my husband had the tuna and its presentation and taste were exactly how the menu read. I had the house Beaujolaise sausage. Wonderful with the lentil reduction. My husband ORDERED the Trout but RECEIVED the Fluke. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. We were given the option of reordering the trout but was told it would take 45minutes before it could be brought to the table. That is why I gave this review a three. We have heard great reviews about this establishment but were greatly disappointed when my husband received the wrong dish and was told it would be a 45 minute wait for the correct dish could come out because the kitchen was a little backed up., I had such a wonderful experience here! As soon as I walked in, the hosts greeted me warmly and invited me to appreciate the unique plate art throughout the restaurant. I ate dinner at the bar, where bartenders Rob and Christina waited on me hand and foot. Before I realized my wine or water glass was empty, they were refilling it. I started out with the squash soup and savored every drop. Rich, creamy, and the perfect temperature. Next came the eggplant, which was beautifully plated and so tasty. Then I had the tuna cruda- simply exquisite. The spice and radish went impeccably well with the tuna. I also enjoyed the escargot, served with hazelnuts for a great blend of flavors. I finished the evening with the chocolate sundae, which I can safely say was the best sundae that I have ever had. Chocolate on top of chocolate on top of chocolate! Amazing. Not being able to resist, I also sampled the Madeleines, which did not disappoint. They were so fluffy and light, with the perfect hint of lemon. Throughout the night, the servers came to check on me and make sure I was well taken care of. Everyone I met was kind and accommodating. Chef Ed even came by to make sure I was enjoying my meal! The incredible food, top notch employees, and sleek atmosphere made my time at DBGB a night to remember. I highly recommend it!, I went to DBGB for a drink prior to going somewhere else for dinner and a football game. As I sat at the bar, the staff was so welcoming and friendly that I decided to stay for dinner. I ordered the burger and it was one of the best burgers I have ever had.They were even nice enough to put on the football game for me. I would highly recommend DBGB., The food was delicious:Chop-chop salad: 9/10Tunisienne sausage: 8/10Beaujolaise sausage: 8/5/10Linguini du sud: 7/10 (the pasta itself was great but the seafood was so-so)Chestnut ice cream: 9/10However, I docked three stars because the service was so overwhelming and anxiety-inducing: seven different people stopped by our table over 15 times, during the hour and twenty minutes we had to get through dinner and drinks. This was partly because we came for an early seating, so they werent very busy yet, partly because the table was so small they had to keep readjusting our plates and taking away and bringing new items, but it was also due to a lack of awareness that interrupting diners every 2-5 minutes with various questions and nudges (however polite) is extremely unpleasant. We could hardly carry on a conversation.Well be back for the food but will ask for a larger table tucked away in a corner, in the hopes of not being interrupted so often., Ive never posted on Yelp before, but had to after tonights awful experience. Went here with my wife to get a drink after a night out on the town. We arrived and there were 2 seats left at the bar. There were about 12 seats total in the bar area and at the time only one bartender behind the bar, so he was very slow to get to us. We wait over 10 minutes before the bartender acknowledges us and gives us cocktail menus. I was looking forward to ordering a drink that I had gotten here just over a month ago when this place opened - it was a great drink. To my surprise, the drink was no longer available....what gives? Not even open two months and the menus already been changed. Also, the price of all the cocktails was now $14...they were all $13 the last time I was here. 5 minutes after getting our menus 2 other servers show up behind the bar and one of them takes our drink order, and we also ask for water. Another 5 minutes goes by before we get our drinks (total 20 minutes to get drinks...way too long!). However, our waters have been forgotten and are nowhere to be found. 10 minutes go by and our waters are still nowhere to be found, so I pulled out a water bottle that I had on me (we needed our water!). No one asks us how were doing the whole time were there. Another 10 minutes goes by and were almost done with our drinks before we finally get our waters...ugh. We ask another bartender for our check. As Im signing the check another bartender comes by and tries to take our water bottle, but we tell him were leaving and are taking the bottle with us. He very rudely tells us outside drinks are not allowed. Ummm, (1) its only water, (2) were leaving, and (3) we wouldnt need it if we had gotten our waters that we asked for 20 minutes earlier! I was shocked by how rude the guy was. What a horrible way to end the evening. I live in the DC area, but dont ever plan on coming back to this place, and would not recommend to anyone else. Was at Del Friscos steakhouse for dinner earlier in the evening and that was by far a way better experience., The best DC restaurant is here ,only twenty years too late. Perhaps a couple of decades ago this restaurant would have added some excitement to the culinary scene but as it is its a poor attempt by a chef passed his prime to cash in on the growing culinary scene innDC. The food lacks any real flavour, mediocre at best. Only the blood sausage was worth eating. Service was atrocious. Server seemed to lack any polish or skills.iit was more like a dinner but in a bad way. The decoration seemed very self congratulatory with other celebraty chef plates all over the walls. The tables were too close. The restaurant reminded me of Hard Rock Cafe for celebraty chefs but with worst food and service.Save your money and stop supporting bad restaurants!ZERO stars!, Oops, I did it again! I went to the bar at DBGB, again, at the request of my date who had never been, and lo and behold, another bartender who couldnt smile or be polite! Not to mention, under my bar stool was reminants of a salad: lettuce and such. Not a nice thing to step, or slip on! The bartender lady, without even looking my date and I in the eye, informed us that the beer we ordered off the beer menu was not available. Could she have suggested another one? Yes, but no she didnt.With a surly attitude like that, we promplty left. (We went to another restaurant right next door and had a fabulous time with a wonderful bartendress.) Read on for the next review of Del Friscos.Daniel Boulud, can you give your bartenders a smile, and a nice attitude?, Stopped in walking home for dinner. The decor is nice but a tad loud. The server was great and spot on with recommendations. I had the squash soup (excellent) and sweet and sour eggplant (excellent). Price was a bit high but worth the bucks., Terrible. Sub-standard. Definitely not up to the standards of a celebrity chef.Incidents:Croque monsieur was not cooked all the way through. The ham inside reminded me of Oscar Mayer ham, certainly not jambon de bayonne or a good Virginia ham. Waitress did not let us know the sausages were as big as a child pinky, and therefore two people in my party were left with entrees the size of half an appetizer. She should have alerted us beforehand. The mustard that accompanied the pate was absolutely disgusting; it tasted like a green jolly rancher and was a color of green that is not found in nature. It was disgusting, disappointing, and a terrible reflection of a restaurant and chef that should be/is pretty good. Nothing like the NYC location. Go to Central or Le Diplomate instead. Total waste of calories, time, and money., Enjoyed having dinner here, but it is definitely overpriced for what you get (it is able to get away with it because of the famous DBDG name). We ordered the grilled kale (which was soggy and unimpressive), and the burger and hanger steak (both were well seasoned and perfectly cooked). Drinks are pricey- a glass of sparkling wine starts at $16. Probably wont make this a regular spot even though I live around the corner... There are too many other restaurants in DC that have great food/ambiance and are a far better value!, My husband and I dined here and absolutely loved it! The service was great and on point from the moment you walk in the door. Our server Kevrika was a joy and was very detailed and helpful in answering our questions about menu items. I started with the Crispy Kale Salad ---- OMG, it was devine! The Kale accompanied with the Brussel Sprouts and Sweet Potatoes was an amazing collaboration. The only reason I didnt order a second one is because I wanted to have room for my entree -- which was the Lamb. My lamb was cooked medium, and I usually dont prefer it that way, but the taste was true and just perfect. I enjoyed every bite! My husband started with the Oysters and the Tunisienne House Made Sausage. His oysters were very fresh and were a good size. The sausage was everything Kevrika said it would be -- Delicious! My husband selected the Frenchie Burger as his entree. It was prepared to his satisfaction and met his expectation. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening and ended it with the Apple Tart and Chestnut Ice Cream. The ice cream was a interesting and good choice!Oh, by the way, the atmosphere was nice too! We will definitely dine there again! My only suggestion is to add Brussel Sprouts to the menu as a side dish. They wear the best, but the few that came with the Kale Salad were a tease !, This review is for brunch. My friend and I were excited to try DBGB, but we were disappointed. I ordered the oeuf forestier, which was supposed to be eggs with gruyere, wild mushrooms, and caramelized onions. The eggs were RAW. They were aiming for sunny side up, and so I expected a runny yoke, but even the white part of the eggs was raw. In fact, there was very little white, as that part of the egg was so raw it was clear. The rest of the dish was lacking in flavor as well. I strongly considered sending it back, or telling the waiter after the meal that the dish was raw, but he was MIA at the end of the meal and only made a fleeting appearance to pick up our check without stopping to ask how things were, so I decided not to make a fuss. But I definitely will not be returning for brunch.The reason this gets two stars (and not one) is because I also tried DBGB for dinner, and had the coq au vin, which was quite tasty. I would give it 3-3.5 stars for dinner, and would return -- but only in the evening., I was so excited to find chef was expanding into DC. Because of the popularity my fianc39 and I stopped by for an early dinner, but the restaurant was pretty empty at 6:30 so Im not sure why we couldnt make a later reservation. The food here is fantastic but the atmosphere is a bit odd. High price food but with a semi casual atmosphere. For example all of the mustards and sauces come in fast food squeeze bottles to accompany my $30 charcuterie plate. I thought it was kinda strange.For main courses, I ordered the pancetta wrapped trout and my fianc39 ordered the steak. Both were two of the best dishes Ive ever tasted and the portions were very large. That being said the restaurant is extremely expensive so Im glad we got a decent amount of food for the price. Since its truffle season you can add truffles to all of the dishes, however, when the dishes are already $30-50 a piece, we passed on the additional expense. There was a truffle steak on the menu that was tempting but the hefty $65 price tag made me think twice. Our waiter was very attentive and friendly. Food came out pretty quickly as did our drinks. I would come back again for the food but the price makes it hard to justify more than the occasional visit., I came here for brunch with a group of friends. Theye known for their sausages, so we decided to split a bunch of sausages, the bread basket, and scrambled eggs. First off, the good: The sausages! We ordered the Tunisienne, Thai, Vermont, and Beaujolaise. The sausages were served with a bit of a side (chick peas, rice, hashbrown, and lentils). The sides were solid, but I think that the sausages stole the show -- and I not really a big sausage/meat fan. My favorite was the Tunisienne because I like the flavor of lamb. I thought that it was immensely flavorful with a tiny bit of spiciness. My second favorite was the Beaujolaise. I thought that had a nice savoriness to it. The Thai was a bit blander, possibly because it was in comparison to the Tunisienne. The Vermont had cheddar stuffed inside. It was good, but not really my thing. However, the friends who were with me loved that. The mediocre: The scrambled eggs were a bit underwhelming. They had a nice fluffy texture, but not much flavor. i think that they were supposed to have crab meat? Not sure, couldn taste it..., I ate here with a friend the other night. First and foremost, the place is loud. LOUD. Almost mind-numbingly LOUD. We had to really yell across our tiny two top table to chat.The drinks were flavorful and strong. Try the naked and famous (mezcal, Aperol, yello chartreuse, lime juice). Trust me on this one.The food was good. We shared the tartar. It was spectacular. Calamari had a bit of a Thai feel. Flavors were nice, but the squid was cold. We were hesitant to try the sausages due to concerns for an overly heavy meal. We were wrong. The boudin blanc was a sausage revelation (if there is such a thing). Not sure how they managed to make sausage, mashed potatoes, and apples light as air... but they did. Fried chicken and pasta with bottarga were our mains. Everything was tasty. There is an interesting hominy/deep fried grit cake (looks like fish sticks) on top of the collards. A brilliant riff on a Southern classic.We got the Baked Alaska. Please keep in mind, it may not be the Baked Alaska you are thinking of. It is very reminiscent of the sliced watermelon roll that you may remember from Carvel as a kid. However, this one is more fun, in that they light it on fire for you. Plus it tastes good.The service was very good.Overall, food was good. Great, even. But the room was sooooo loud, Im not sure if I will be rushing back., Super cool ambience and decor. All these plates with drawings on them! I forgot to ask our server what the story behind the plates is! The complimentary bread basket in the beginning was kind of awesome, because it included these large crispy pita chips-like things. Calamari was tender and delicious. Not sure about the kaffir lime cream it came with- tasted like key lime pie, which is weird with calamari. Kind of clashed! Steak tartar was alright. My fluke was AMAZING. Didnt care for the capers on top, but the cauliflower paste was absolutely delicious. My friends trout was also quite yummy, stuffed with some herb-y spinach? And the black angus beef duo is so tender and succulent! Service was great. Oh did I mention that they have an orange white-blend wine? Absolutely refreshing!Downside? Portions are wayyy too small. For the price were paying, I dont want to have to eat a second dinner! But I did, unfortunately., We had a 9:30pm dinner res on a friday night and had a great time. I had the steak tartare which was a great and filling option when I wanted the whole DBGB experience but wasnt particularly starving. Two of my friends had the steak/beef duo and said it was delicious, another had the duck and enjoyed it as well. The real reason Im writing this, however, is because their sommeliere was fantastic. She was a petite brunette from Chicago - I didnt catch her name - but she was enthusiastic, friendly, and recommended a number of wines for us. The one we picked- a Brooks 2012 from the Wilamette valley in oregon was delicious and paired perfectly with the entrees that wed already chosen. Our food was ready REALLY quickly- in fact, so quickly, that we hadnt even had our wine poured when the food arrived. Its a little pricey for small portions, but if you know that going in, you know what to expect. Those are relatively small cons- otherwise we had a lovely time and a great meal., We went probably the first or second week they opened. Atmosphere and decor are nice. We love visiting the city center plaza area in the summer where the fountain and big screens are. But we probably wont be eating here again. They specialize in sausage and pride themselves on using butter, etc. I pretend to be health conscious most of the time and there really wasnt much on the menu that I felt like eating. I had a trout dish w greens and pork and potatoes. I liked it but it was meh. My husband got a burger with a crabcake on top. He felt the same way. Its a little overpriced also., This is a four and a half star review!! Not only was the service impeccable, but the Frenchie burger was the epitome of deliciousness albeit being $19. The half star take off was for the fries being a hard meh( and I am a fry connoisseur) as I felt they werent a good shoestring(or that they even used shoestring for that matter)There were 4 of us that evening, and on a Friday night at 7:00 pm , we were able to score a table for 4 on OpenTable for an 8:45 rezzie. I LOVE walking in City Center because it staunchly reminds me of Vegas!! We walk in and wait less than 30 seconds to be seated by three hosts who have customer service down. We sat at our well situated table next to the back windows but on the end so we had plenty of room to stretch, and commenced to order delicious cocktails and appys. The calamari and the sausage were AMAZING as was my cocktail although I need to check on the name of it. 3 out of 4 of us ordered the Frenchie with one person ordering the coq au vin. They didnt love it; if anything, they professed it to be slightly dry. Those of us with Frenchies were in heaven.... again it was $19 for the burger, so it had better be amazing. The medium was perfection but I suspect the pork belly was really just bacon. :)All in all, ambiance was amazing, as was the service, the decor, the entire environ. They just need to do better on the fries and the moisture of the chicken and they are cruising to a 5 star situation!!, I had dinner with 3 friends at DBGB on 18 Nov. The ambiance was good, the service inconsistent and down hill from there. The coq au vin was too salty and smoky. The duck breast not so good. just bland. The baked alaska was not like any baked alaska i have tasted - very pre-fab. And wines by the glass at $15!! Its a shame to use a name to get away with overpriced and underwhelming food...and the server was attentive to start with and then just disappeared. The only outstanding item was the egg plant appetizer. We will not be going back., I never want to rate based on service, so bad service aside, I thought the menu was imaginative. There were a lot of interesting choices for apps. As for The Mains I was not inspired by any of the choices and actually settled and the burger. It was really quite tasty, but at $19 I could think of better burgers in the city for about nine bucks less. Overall, I just couldn get excited about this place. Bummer., I didnt love the space, but I was generally impressed with the food. Tuna crudonwas good, but I would opt for the steak tartare next time, portion was a little small, but so delicious. Though on the small side, I thought the price ($14) ws fair - and it was delicious. I did not experience anything that would help me to understand he complaints about portion sizes.My steak with sunchokes, mushrooms and white truffles was decadent and rich, but balanced and perfectly executed.We went on a Sunday and it was a bit quiet - which was actually nice....was gld we had a booth - tables look quite small.All things considered, I really enjoyed the meal and will return., Whole hog dinner with Bourbon and beer! If you have a group of folks who like pig, beer and bourbon, this is a great deal! One suckling pig, check! One bottle of bourbon, check! And all the beer you care for equals a good time had by all., Ive eaten at DBGB twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. The menu for lunch was very similar to dinner. I consider myself somewhat of a foodie and have been to all the nice, fancy, expensive restaurants in DC. This one was consistently good on both occasions, with every single persons meal being delicious. I got the steak tar tar, the sweet and sour egg plant, and squash soup for appetizers. All delicious! I think my favorite was the egg plant, so unique. For entrees I had the lamb bolognese and the beef duo (hanger steak and beef ragou). The hanger steak was amazing. Great flavor and cooked perfectly. The ambiance was very cute and charming. Its fun being in the new CityCenter. The service was also very good. I definitely will be back and hope this restaurant does well. The location is a little out of the maintstream areas like DuPont and 14th street corridor, but its certainly worth the trip!, Came here in October for dinner. Had a very good burger and a great beer, black IPA from somewhere local. Kinda overpriced but not a bad choice for a night out in the neighborhood., While on a business trip we decided to give Daniels DC DBGB location a try. I had previously dined at the NY location and enjoyed my meal every time, DC did not disappoint. The food and service was fantastic. I normally have gotten their burgers while in NY (speaking of which, I wish they had the Piggie burger in DC. It has to be in my top 5 burgers all time) but this time I decided to go for the trout. They cooked it perfectly. And for dessert make sure you have the Grand Marnier souffle, you will not leave disappointed!, We asked for a booth, they sat us in the middle of a room on a tiny table 6 inches from the next table. So crammed in here you feel you are dining with your neighbor. No private conversations here. Food was fine, but they do not listen to their customers. I live in a condo next door, and would have come here frequently had we been treated better and not crammed in, Ordered the burger and fries. Worst burger Ive had in months. Tasteless meat, not medium rare (as Id ordered) and generally crappy tasting. Could they at least TRY and put something with flavor on it? Importantly, the woman next to me did not eat her burger and when the server asked her what was wrong she told him that the burger was tasteless. For the price, this is ridiculous. This place caters to the wealthy newcomers of the neighborhood and it does not even deliver a quality product. If it could at least maintain a modicum of quality, it could get a pass. But it does not. It banks in on a new development and delivers a sub-par product and experience. Clear out and let someone else that can actually cook take over., I always live chef db restaurant. I got seated right away as soon as I walk in. He hostess are very nice and polite same thing with my server. Just one thing that after I got seated, it took them a while to give me the menu, there is one gentlemen in suite walking toward me but he dont realized or maybe dont pay attention that I dont even have menu, he was looking at the mirror behind me. Im hungry so. My sausage as an app is really good. I ordered blueberry waffles sooo good!!!! Im visiting from nyc work trip. Il come back for sure coz I love your food!!, My boyfriend and I came here for brunch on a Sunday in December. I had been wanting to try DBGB for a while and when I saw they had brunch we headed straight there.The interior is lovely. I thought it was appealing and clean, not too over the top or ostentatious (which you might expect in City Center).Our waiter recommended the oeuf forestier and my boyfriend had the Yankee burger. Another reviewer said that her oeuf forestier was nearly raw, but I had the opposite experience. I quite like a runny yoke, but mine was baked pretty hard. It was still totally delicious, and despite looking like a small portion, the crusty French bread helped get every last bit of cheesy eggy goodness and I was full all day. My boyfriend absolutely loved the Yankee burger, he even remarked on how good the bun was (high praise from a meat-centric man).The service was just OK. They really tried to be attentive but they were never around when we needed them, for example to refill coffee or order another drink. Weirdly, despite the fact that the restaurant was not loud at all it was bizarrely difficult to hear the wait staff. Im not sure if theyre trained to speak quietly but I had to really strain to hear what 3 different employees were saying when they were standing right at our table.I would definitely recommend this place for brunch. The food was delicious and the prices are pretty standard for DC, not especially outrageous. Although, we did not drink any alcohol so Im sure that would make a big difference to the bottom line. Hopefully this is just a factor of their newness - but the place was less than half full for Sunday brunch at 1 pm. Not a good sign for them, but great for us because we didnt feel like waiting 30 minutes at Silo or 1 hour at BB&P. Well be recommending DBGB for anyone looking for a new brunch spot around Chinatown / Downtown., This place is great and they offer some nice dishes. Date and I ordered sausages, soup and baked Alaska. The sausages were tender and nice garnish with it. Biggest problem with that dish was there wasnt enough! I get that its on the small plate menu, but uoi can go to that sausages place in alexandria and get a whole meal.The soup was tasty... surprisingly tasted exactly the same as SAX butternut squash soup. Even right down to the raisins that were in it. I thought that was odd.Now for the thing I was most excited about! The baked Alaska! It looked just as I imagined from the painted drawing on the window. They poured liqour on it and set it on fire and the marshmellow topping roasted and it was great presentation. Until... you try to it... the baked alaska was a bit too frozen :/ couldnt really taste the pistachio differentiate from the vanilla ice cream.So yeah... 3 stars. Nothing you cant find elsewhere and I didnt get my food to pay ratio satisfied. But definitely a place to take people for a novel dessert. Other than that... cant see myself coming back here., Went to DBGB for dinner the other night and impressed throughout the evening. The service was very friendly and the food was excellent! I highly recommend the Foie gras and the Tuna crudo. And dont forget to order dessert, the Baked Alaska is very good and they light it on fire at your table! Overall, a great experience and would recommend it to others., Ill start with the good stuff: very friendly, attentive and knowledgable wait staff. Friendly hosts. The food was decent, although I found it uninspiring and overpriced. More of the same for DC - high-end burgers, rich entrees of fish and/or steak, small plate appetizers (calamari, salad, tuna/steak tartare).Perfect place for some of the lawyers at nearby firms to take their summer associates to lunch this summer. Meh., Two of us stopped in on a recent cold December Sunday night. Greeting was friendly and the hostess offered to check our coats. Nice. Neither of us knew what to expect...we just wanted to check out the new City Center, since it seemed like just yesterday when it was a big parking lot with periodic trapeze classes. Perusing the menu, I knew right away I couldn leave without a Crispy Egg experience, complete with rapini, shaved radish and anchovy aioli. This was phenomenal! Not Husband thing, so poor me had it all to myself, while he chowed down on an array of excellent bread. (see pic...yes, it was as good as it looks!)The other thing I had to try was the Thai Sausage small plate, while Husband opted to try the Vermont with hashbrowns. (more like a potato cake). I liked the Thai one, but would have liked it better with a little heat. Husband liked his Vermont okay, but felt it was fairly ordinary. (uh, Husband, there were other things on the menu more interesting, just sayin!)Both of us agreed that our choice of dessert was exceptional and so surprisingly delightful in presentation...the Rocky Road Profiterole! When that chocolate-domed dish appeared and hot chocolate sauce was poured over it, only to have a giant profiterole filled with ice cream appear, (and not be soggy after all that!)...well, it totally exceeded our cream puff expectations!Service was attentive and we appreciated it. Surprisingly neither of us did any alcohol. (not sure why not, but nothing was crying out for this wine-loving gal to try...temporary insanity?), I think this restaurant is great - I probably would have given it a 4.8 had I been able to but I will get to that later. Certainly deserves more than a 4, certainly. We were there the 29th of December (Monday night). First off the staff is very competent, pleasant, (not taken with themselves). Our service was great (Jeremy, I think....). The place is not DC Trendy, and I am not sure this is what they are looking for - which for me is a plus. (though I certainly enjoy some of the trendy places....) The decor is lovely - interesting, bright, and tasteful.... and fun, to boot. Very nice lighting and the noise level is far from hush - but you can hear folks at the table and the wait staff. We had the steak tartare and roasted kale with other vegetables.... both were traditional and certainly outstanding. I had the salmon which was outstanding: a lovely crust and a sauce that beautifully complimented the salmon. My friend had the Coq au vin. Wow the sauce was truly as good as CAV gets.... impressive. We were told the sausages were excellent but we were having the Baked Alaska so already had ordered enough food. The cocktails were excellent - we had one traditional and one new/trendy. We had wine that was also lovely and a great compliment to our meal and finished out with some great armagnac. A GREAT wine list, cocktails, and other alcohol. The breads were not in-house which is not practical these days, but were outstanding -- and quite a nice variety... The friend I was with wanted the Baked Alaska, I was game, but we also had some of the (additional) fabulous ice cream... The BA was great - very traditional, very very well done.... I find some of the criticisms in reviews either stupid or vacuous! Complaining that the ice cream is too cold in the Baked Alaska made me grimace and guffaw..... really, bud. Yes, ice cream IS best served less than totally hard -but making Baked Alaska, because it is baked requires a very frozen block of ice cream sooo when it has been served wait a while.... so..... I will go back, happily - and suspect I will still have the same high quality food and service -- The food we had was not cutting edge or innovative - and that okay folks --- (the reason I would have given a 4.8 had I been able). There are other restaurants in DC where you can get innovation - but there is no need to knock down DBGB down!, Very nice place with a laid back atmosphere. Plates are small but it works well for sampling different things. The sausages are the stars here. All I could recommend except the Vermont. Very heavy and overpowered by the cheese. The Frenchie burger is great but not sure its a $19 burger., Great Food, Great Service, Great Night!Wives were out of town so the men got together for dinner. DBGB is a welcome new addition to the DC foodie scene. Relaxed, cool environment - great food. Service was really good too. Steak Tartare and the Coq au Vin very good. Fried chicken looked awesome. Dont miss the Baked Alaska for desert! Big enough for 4 to share! Will be back., Second time visiting this restaurant earlier this week. This time for lunch. I had another great experience. It was an extremely cold day in the City and I ordered the squash soup and the chop chop salad. The soup was delicious! It was rich, velvety and had tons of depth. I cant wait to go back to have another bowl! The salad was fresh, light and tasty. It was the perfect lunch. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about all the menu items, and the restaurants both here in DC and NYC. Will definitely be back., My bf & I went for a burger night on Friday & it was so disappointing. The fries were slightly overcooked & absolutely over-salted, and the burger was nothing great. It didnt have any flavor, the bun seemed like it was out of the grocery store, & the lettuce wasnt fresh. If Boulud is going to put his name on this, he might want to check in every now & then. Oh, & this less than mediocre burger was $20., Be forewarned: If you are going as a group of two, then you will be crowded beside other two-person tables with no privacy. You will be a few inches away from annoying, loud conversations to your left and right. So if youre looking for a romantic place to take your partner, look elsewhere. DBGB has fallen prey to the increasingly common practice of restaurants seating people like cattle. Restaurants like this forget that the reason why people eat out is partly for the ambiance, and if I have to spend an hour overhearing every awkward word of the blind-date seated four inches away, Id rather stay home., Went there New Years Eve. The service was rushed. The appetizer and dessert were fine but the entree (new york strip steak) was cold and tough. When the waiter noticed that I was sending it back uneaten, he asked what was wrong. The manager than came over and offered me a drink. I told him I already had a glass of wine and a complimentary glass of champagne for the new years toast. He walked away.Seriously, this is Daniel Boulard customer service? This is what Daniel Boulard produces for $90? Never again.
18|dirty-habit-washington|I had the pleasure of attending the soft opening of Dirty Habit this past Wednesday. To sum up my experience from start to finish, it was AWESOME.Tucked toward the back of the lobby of Hotel Monaco, Dirty Habit lures you in right away with dark, glowing signage and a gigantic lion sculpture made of mismatched hardware (nuts, bolts, gears, springs... you name it). When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by friendly faces and seated in a large booth. My first instinct was to touch everything I passed: the walls, tables, seats, and counter-tops all had alluring textures in rich, dark-colored finishes. Modern industrial-style lighting hung from the ceilings and filled the space with dim-- almost creepy-- lighting. We also noticed large gears and cables above the open kitchen area and thought that they were just for decoration until a sever went over and started turning the gears -- It was actually a working cable system that opens and closes a wall between the open kitchen and the dining room! So cool. My friends and I also noticed an area on the top of our table that housed a power outlet and a USB outlet. Talk about appealing to the modern professional crowd who always need to charge their electronics! Our server came over and explained that the menu consists of global eats, so each dish has lots of different ethnic influences at play. She said the kitchen would be sending out several different menu items for us to try. We began by getting warm bread and whipped butter in a dark wooden cigar box, followed by numerous appetizers. Some standouts were the duck meatballs stuffed with cheese (a rich, almost smokey BBQ flavor), tuna tartare served on prawn crackers (silky tuna that almost melted in your mouth), and Korean fried chicken wings that had a spicy & sweet sauce so out-of-this-world that I was literally scraping the plate to devour the last remnants. For entrees, we split the Chilean sea bass and the Dirty Habit house burger. The sea bass was one of the best things Ie ever put in my mouth. It was served on a bed of crispy rice, and the texture of the rice against the buttery soft fish was absolute heaven. The burger was also a hit: the meat was prepared medium with a light pink center, and the fries that accompanied it were thick, hot, and crispy.We also went a bit crazy with the cocktails and tried a little bit of everything. I would highly recommend the Rice  Roses: vodka, lychee, rose, and almond served over crushed ice. It was light, airy, and complimented all of the food very well. The Sherry Cobbler was also a standout with a mix of sherry, vanilla, cinnamon, and muddled berries. It was absolutely delicious and could double as a liquid dessert!When it was time to leave, we were in a total food coma. We somehow mustered up enough energy to wander through the rest of the restaurant and peek around. In all, Dirty Habit consists of a front bar near the main dining room, a back bar with a lounge area, several private dining rooms, and the best part.... a HUGE patio with an outside bar and fire pits!!! (The patio is still under construction... but it totally going to be my home away from home as soon as it finished!) We also passed several more metal sculptures made from mismatched hardware, including one in the form of a man cowering in a corner. Yes, the creepiness factor was definitely there... but I liked it and know Il be back for more. Everyone has a dirty habit, and this one is going to be mine!, Great trendy space and decor (more black and grey modern style than an insane asylum motif as it been described). The back bar with glass enclosure is definitely a hang out spot. The cocktails are a must try. As far as food standouts, the duck was delicious, the hen dumpling filling was amazing,the scallops were perfectly seasoned and the desserts were incredible, including the chocolate flan. The service was attentive and friendly., The first reviewer must have been given a free meal for the review or has a financial interest in Dirty Habit because it is waaaay too glowing considering our experience.Went on opening day and there were plenty of hiccups that hopefully will be fixed as time goes on. The service was comically slow considering how empty the restaurant was. Our drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive. Stay away from the wines by the glass, as the pours are stingier than anywhere else in DC. The menu layout is poorly conceived. Its a single list without any indication of size. The waitress said everything was shareable, yet that doesnt make sense for some of the options. For example, who shares a hamburger? Take a bite and pass it along?! Or clumsily cut a burger into fourths to share? Youre better off going to nearby Fuddruckers. If in fact the dishes are all small sharing sizes youre going to get palpitations when the bill comes because most of the items are priced like entrees., Dirty habit is located in Monaco hotel. The hotel it self is very pretty. I love the color combination and how classic but yet modern it is. It a mixture between the old and new. It Absolutely gives you the feel of creepiness somehow. I don know if you know the history of the hotel but it does have a reputation of being hunted which makes it very very interesting! Specially if you like creepy stuff like I do :D Dirty habit I Loooove the name and some of their cocktails name such as dirty decisions. Everything goes very well with the hotel history.. Their theme is creepinessThe restaurant is spacious, love the high ceilings and the dark accent. They described it to me as apocalyptic  Gotham-esque vibe and their idea is to make you feel uncomfortable.. I really like the concept they came up with! It very unique and inviting somehow. They have a huge lounge in the back of the restaurant. Good spot for drinks and some bites. They also have a nice patio! Perfect when the weather is nice! Service: was excellent! I hope they keep up the good job in the future. Menu: was decent. Very small tapas and the bill could get really expensive. I wouldn come here for dinner as it could get really expensive but I would definitely come back for drinks and some bites.The food Ie tried:*Poached hen dumplings: Foie gras, mushroom broth, barrel aged soy sauce $14*American wagyu beef tartar: Black garlic aioli, shallot, parmesan, baguette $14*Scallop a la plancha: Cauliflower puree, radish, apple-celery espuma $17*Grilled marinated skirt steak: Pickled radish, burnt scallion vinaigrette $18Overall the food was really delicious and the standout dish was the scallop! Dessert: I not really a big fan of their dessert! I liked the presentation! Very tempting but I wasn too impressed with whatever Ie tried. Their cocktails are very creative! My favorite was the rice and roses.. And they have many more good ones., Were locals and loved coming here when it was Poste because we loved the service and signature drinks. Dirty Habit is beyond what it (Poste) used to be in drinks, food and ambiance & decor. We stopped in tonight right after opening for a drink (or two) and couldnt believe how much DH has exceeded our expectations! The drinks spanned the spectrum (signature, classic) we were both very happy with our selections. Staff listened to our preferences and recommended a few others based on our tastes and we were amazed. We tried, on recommendation, the fried duck meatballs which were amazing. The rolls and butter they also bring are killer!Were so glad to have our neighborhood favorite back open and cannot wait to get back when we have time to try the rest of the drinks and dinner menu (hoping they expand to brunch for the weekend). Dirty Habit is on par, if not above, the best restaurant/bar experience weve been to in NW DC., My wife and I went to Dirty Habit last Friday as part of the soft open. The first thing you notice is the absolutely amazing decor. Having been to its predecessor Poste numerous times, I was extremely impressed by the thought process and artistry that went in to building this new restaurant. The restaurant gives off a very modern and unique industrial vibe with really cool lighting, beams, and art work. There is nothing in DC that comes even close.The place was packed and being that it was a soft open, we were expecting a lot of hiccups. To our surprise, aside from the service being a little slow, everything was wonderful. Our server was extremely attentive, polite, welcoming and, most importantly, knowledgeable of the menu. The food itself was also delicious. I ordered the Chicken Wings, Tuna Tartar and the Chilean Seabass. This is not hyperbole but the wings were probably the best I have ever eaten. They chef incorporated this amazing mix of spices that I have never seen used on wings. I would highly recommend this one dish.The Tuna Tartar was very good but I thought the pieces of tuna could have been cut a little larger. They were diced very finely and I think that the size did not allow the delicate fish to marinate properly.The Chilean Seabass was also superbly prepared. It was well seasoned and you could taste the smoke used in the cooking process, giving it a very unique flavor.I would also highly recommend ordering the homemade potato rolls. Absolutely sensational. They are also served in really cool old school cigar boxes.IMO - I think their dessert options need a bit of work. They come as small portions and presented beautifully. Of the two we tried, however, I just wasnt overly impressed. I thought the chef was trying to do a bit too much and sometimes with desserts the art of simplicity is lost. Lastly, they have a small but decent kids menu and my daughter loved the chicken tenders and french fries. Hard not to love that combination.Overall, we were extremely impressed with the restaurant. It is clear that the owners put a great deal of time and thought behind the concept and I am sure those few minor issues that are normal and to be expected from a new restaurant will be rectified. Its about time that DC get a restaurant that is not as sterile and mundane as the rest of the city. Great meal and ambiance and will definitely go back., 3.5 stars. A few of us went to Dirty Habit last night for happy hour, my first time there since it rebranding and reopening. I had been to Poste a few times and I must say, my favorite thing about it was the beautiful, large, outdoor courtyard. It was so pleasant to spend a spring/summer/fall evening out there. When I walked into Dirty Habit I was impressed by the change in d39cor and style, definitely very chic. But when I got to what was the former Poste courtyard, I was surprised to see it is now an enclosed, dark, bar area. The bar itself is very nice, and the space has some tables (guessing for dinner) and some high-tops. The lighting is dim and it has some blue accent lights. I was super sad that the courtyard seemed to be gone, BUT THEN I saw that there is STILL some outdoor space that seems to not be open yet. I saw, through the windows, another large bar outside and some space. PHEW!! So whenever that opens Il have to go back and see how it is! I only had drinks so I can opine about the food, and I thought the drinks were pretty pricey, $11 for a Tito (that a bit pricey, right?). My friend had a martini and it was $17! and it was served in one of those tiny, old style champagne glasses! I was outraged lol. Just a superrrr tiny drink for $17 is crazy. OH and a bizarre thing was: a waitress came around at one point with a tray of little appetizer bite looking things on toothpicks, and she walked up to us and said would you like to try this special bite from our chef? we were like sure! we go to reach for it and she goes, $2 each. LOL what?! So everyone legit drew back their hands and was like oh, ok, no thanks. LOL it was just so awkward!!! Like whaaa, tell us they have a price before you offer them and make it sound like it a small token from the chef so you can try some stuff since they just opened. Also are we supposed to go get our wallets and look for two singles? lol so awkward. Il go back when the outdoor space is open (if they can do so before winter) and try some food and see how it goes!, Ie like to echo Ally T comments in her review. Though I wasn yet at the bar for the bait and switch would you like to try these appetizers? situation, that would have made me so annoyed! I was only at Dirty Habit for an hour or so, and thought decor-wise, the place was great. The glassware they use is very beautiful and chic and made you feel fancy! However, the service was very hit or miss, and I agree w/ Ally that prices are ridiculous, considering the hip, cool vibe they are going for. Also, dont offer 8oz pours of white wine at $20/pop. The wine will get warm. Who ever came up with that idea should be demoted!, hmmmm - I am not sure why our table had four different chairs. Three of them were too tall for the table. Service was awkward. We were seated without a cocktail menu. There was a hesitancy when dishes were delivered. Fresh plates were brought out twice - the 2nd time we had already had all of our food delivered. Overall, between the waiter and food runners - nobody seemed to be working in sync.Food was good, however too expensive for the small plates., This place is amazing ! Hands down absolutely the best new spot in the penn quarter/chinatown area. The service was impeccable, not overbearing but took very good care of us. The menu is outstanding and the food is even better.... we tried 7 dishes and loved them all, each has its own unique flavor profile that does not disappoint. The actual restaurant space is beautiful! Not only are there multiple bars and several seating areas, there is also a brand new (huge) patio stocked full of big couches, oversized chairs and firepits! I know this spot just opened a week ago, but this is a MUST TRY!!
19|district-supper-washington|I just had a meal there for lunch at District Supper and I must say the food takes your taste buds on a journey with An amazing fuse of flavors with every bite. This is not your everyday kind of meal it is an experience all on its own., My wife and I stopped in for a quick lunch and were really impressed with the wonderful service and quickness of the food coming out. We had the curry pumpkin soup, the chicken pad thai, and the lamb flat bread. They were all really great and on point. I would highly recommend the pad thai. If you are thinking of sharing it: dont! You will be mad you didnt eat the whole thing yourself. Go on in and enjoy. Chef even came out to say hello., I had the duck beignets to go. I loved the texture of the beignet and the duck was such an unexpected addition that I had to try it. I was not disappointed. It had a wonderful sweet, savory, crispy, chewy thing going on at the same time. Cant wait for the restaurant to open., The food is awesome the price is great. If you want an explosion of flavors on how palate this is the best place you can get it., Had lunch with 2 coworkers and enjoyed it very much. We split the order of duck beignets (3 in an order) and theyre a compelling start. Dusted w/ powdered sugar but not too sweet, and drizzled w/ a nice sauce. The shrimp pad thai is non-traditional and pretty tasty stuff. Shrimp nicely cooked. Id like to get back soon to work thru the other promising looking items on the menu. Its only open for lunch right now., Amazing food, chick ambiance, and truly a culinary experience! Chef James is the most creative chef; he is truly a gem in the culinary arts on the rise.My favorite dishes are the Duck Beignets, Hearts of Palm Cake and the best Creme Br3bl39e I have ever tasted.I could go here every day! This is gong to be my husbands and I spot., Do yourself a favor: Eat at District Supper. The food is nothing short of an unforgettable culinary experience. You could (literally) eat every dish on the menu and never have a bad dish. (I know because Ive had every dish on the menu.) But its not just good food--its a creative take on food. Its dishes youve heard of, but like youve never experienced. In short, the food is awesome and you undoubtedly will agree., The food here never disappoints. Every time there is something new and delicious to try. Chef James always comes out to greet his patrons and tell a story of inspiration behind each dish. His Pad Thai is soooo good, even my husband who normally stays away from Asian food refused to share. And now a bakery! Cant wait to have some of those cinnamon rolls mmmmmmm, My husband and I had the privilege to try the special valentines day 5-course menu. It was absolutely amazing! Chef James is very creative and he cooks from the heart. His food is full of surprises. Its comforting yet sophisticated. A must try!, I stopped by for pastries and coffee after a very early morning Yoga class. I was all Ommmmm after class and was going to eat the breakfast I brought but then I saw the chalkboard sign outside advertising Bacon Scones and I was like, Sold!! I got a bacon scone which was indeed delicious, even though it was more of a biscuit quality than a scone. That was ok because I like biscuits better anyways. I also tried the blueberry poptart. Better than Ted Bulletin for sure. My latte was very delicious too. The pastries are self serve so if you are awkward like me it a lot of fumbling with your 100 bags and do-dads that youe carrying to work while you try to get a pastry without touching any other pastry. But that was my only complaint.
20|elizabeths-gone-raw-washington|I am by no means vegan, but I do like to try new things and when the BF and I were invited to dine with some friends who are Vegan we said, why not? Gregg M and I got there a little early so to start out with we had the watermelon margarita. It was quite refreshing. You could taste the tequila without it overpowering the watermelon. A very nice drink. Along with this were some kale chips. The cayenne on them with the salt - yummy. For the meal - we also decided to go with the tasting menu with wine pairings: The first course was a coconut wrap with cilantro and cauliflower served with a cucumber salad and green curry sauce. This was absolutely divine. I have no idea how she got the coconut so thin, but it makes me want to try. Call me silly, but there was also this non-cream that tasted just like sour cream. The green curry gave the whole dish a very nice zing. Next came the salad which was spring peas on butter lettuce with mint and citrus vinaigrette. I can honestly say I haven had peas that fresh in a long time. The vinaigrette was a complement to the salad rather than trying to be a star. To cleanse the palate there was some pineapple sorbet. It was nice and the BF picked up on the ginger, but honestly I would have liked to have a little more pineapple taste in it. For the main dish there was a heirloom tomato stack with farmers cheese, basil oil and kale salad. The tomato stack was amazing. Farmers cheese made with macadamia nuts was absolutely one of my favorite things of the whole night. So much so in fact that I will try to make it. Don get me wrong. It isn cheese, BUT the texture and honestly the taste reminded me a lot of ricotta. Though the kale was a little bitter for me, I will say that with the pinot noir we had paired with the dish - the bitterness disappeared so this was probably my favorite dish of the whole night. For dessert we had two things to split between us. A chocolate bar and a blackberry tart. I liked the cream and the tiny blackerry in the tart, but was not a fan of the crust. The chocolate bar on the other hand reminded me of a twix bar without the gooey center. All in all - this was a totally wonderful experience made better by the company and conversation. I would definitely go back here again and again., This restaurant is by far one of the best Ie been to in the city. I went with a friend (both of us are meat eaters but prefer vegetarian meals). She was the only one of our group of about 12 who wanted to go - and I very glad she was willing to give it a try!I had asked many friends to go to this restaurant and the general answer I got back was there is no way I spending that kind of money to eat lettuce. I can assure anyone who thinks that same way that it is not like that AT ALL. You leave full and the food is far from piles of raw vegetables on your plate. Youl forget about the fact that the food isn cooked if that bothers you. From the moment we made reservations the service was impeccable. Ares, the man who helped make the reservations, nicely and promptly emailed me back the five annoying emails I sent him with changes to the number of our party, the date we were coming, etc. I sure I was very irritating, but he never let on that he thought I was :). When I arrived and met him at the door, he gave me a nice hello like we were old friends who hadn seen each other in a while. The atmosphere kinda felt like an old (city) country club - very traditional - not my style, but it was pretty.We were seated and had kale chips (best Ie ever had, and I a kale fananatic) and water. My friend and I did the tasting menu with the wine pairing. And they aren cheap about their wine pairings - 4 big glasses of wine to go with each dish. The great service continued out through the entire meal. Everyone who came to our table, whether it was to pour water, describe the wines, etc. was super friendly.Elizabeth (the owner) came by during the end of the meal to ask how we liked it and what was our favorite dish. I had trouble picking one because they all were fantastic. The first course was a grape leave stuffed with hicama and mint (and some other things that I can remember). Then we had huge salads with grapefruit and avacado. I know it was just a salad, but...maybe it was the dressing?....this salad was fantastic. The main course was amazing - tarts with cashew cream and fennel with microgreens salad. The palette cleanser I wish I could have had a carton of - peach sorbet with tarragon. And the final dish was some sort of molten chocolate cake with mint creme. I was so full by this point but could not stop eating it. It was sooooo good. They let you take home copies of the menu, whiich comes with a list of all the ingredients in each dish. Of course after my wine pairings, I forgot to do this and left it on the table, so I know I didn do the dishes I had justice in my descriptions - but they all seriously were just so good., Kelly and I were walked up to the area where Elizabeth was, and before we could actually figure out where to go a very elegantly dressed gentleman opened the door to a brownstone walkup and held the door open--I could see you two looked lost. I guessing you were looking for us. We walked up the steps and in to the ante-room of a converted row house--very elegant. We gave him our name and he led us upstairs to a beautifully converted restaurant space that had a loft-like feeling to it. It was filled with an elegant mix of diners and waitstaff. My sister, her husband, and my mother were waiting for us upstairs.We had just had cocktails at Lima (Shout out to the bartender, Stephan)--so we were already feeling good when our drinks (my sister had ordered for us) came out--fantastic.Dinner all around was wonderful. It a set menu--so make sure you check the menu before making reservations--but I think you go for it--the Raw Tasting Menu for August 5th, 2011 started with Crispy Kale Chips. I bit in to them was surprised at how substantive they were--it was kind of like eating fried basil (taste) and potato chips (consistency). I scarfed down the entire bowl. Our appetizer was a Cilantro Macadamia filled Squash Blossomwith Curry Chayote. I not sure what was better--the look or the flavors. The squash blossoms were tender and cut easily with a knife. I am sorry to admit that I didn take time to photograph the meal. The sommelier brought out the first of a few bottles of wine for us to drink with our meal. All were fantastic and all were perfect compliments to the meal. Our salad was a Watermelon and Avocado with Basil salad. There was both red and white watermelons in the salad, garnished with a large, paper-thin wedge of dehydrated watermelon. Again, I not sure if tasted better or looked better, but either way, beautiful. A little palet cleansing of cold Carrot Grapefruit Soup, and then on to the Main Course--an Heirloom Tomato and Corn Tartletwith Parsley Salad. Yum!!!!!For those of you who may wonder, this was an extremely filling meal, though not one that left you stuffed. We were so full by then that we declined the dessert, which that night was a Sweet Peach Cobblerwith Vanilla Bean Ice Cream. Sorry! The service was perfect. The waitstaff were all appropriately friendly and attentive, from beginning to end we were treated wonderfully. I cannot over-recommend Elizabeth. And remember, Elizabeths is only open one night a week--visit it now before it become too popular! I talked to the host on the way out and he said they would probably go to a normal schedule this fall., We had an amazing dinner for my 30th birthday! I loved everything. The highlights were: carrot masala soup, creme fraiche and chocolate cake, and cardamom sorbet. Less excited about mushroom pate for main course... But the olive tapenade was also good (salty!)Our server, Megan, was awesome. Elizabeth came over to say hi and was lovely. A great place., I have been dying to try Elizabeth for over a year, and finally had the opportunity to do so for Valentine Day. Both my boyfriend and I are vegan, and I thought it would be nice to try something fancy and new. It was very fancy, and very tasty.First, as other reviewers have mentioned, their menu is prix fixe, and it is quite expensive, but if you want to celebrate something or splurge, this is definitely worth the money. If you are a member of Live Green, you can get a discount twice a year, which I think is absolutely amazing. Second, they have a pretty full bar, but they couldn make me a Manhattan for lack of sweet vermouth. And don expect the beers that you get at a regular bar - they have a gluten free beer, and some other very fancy beers, as well as a wonderful selection of wines and spirits. But itl cost you. Nothing here is cheap. Again, if you want to splurge or celebrate, hopefully youe not thinking about the price. I got the specialty cocktail of the night, which was divine, even at $18.Third, they are usually only open for dinner on Friday evenings, but they sometimes open on other days and times for special events. Valentine Day is one of them.Elizabeth is in a gorgeous converted row house. It is a very elegant place to dine. On Valentine Day, they even had a live jazz band to provide some music as we dined. It was a nice touch.Even though we had the first reservation of the evening, it took them awhile to get us seated, and I not sure why. Maybe they were just encouraging us to drink. It not like they were waiting for a table to be cleared for us. I thought that was odd. And when we finally were seated, it took a while for the first course to come. Again, I not sure why that was, or whether it the same regardless of when your reservation is. At least we had our drinks and kale chips to tide us over.Finally, the meal...I love that they start you off with Elizabeth amazing kale chips. They are, hands down, the best kale chips Ie ever had, and Ie tried them all. You can purchase them at the restaurant, too. Each course of the four-course meal was delicious. The crackers in the first course (raw crackers? yes!) were one of my favorite things. I don know how they do it, but those crackers are insanely good. There was a vegan pesto in the second course that made me fall in love, and their take on ravioli was both gorgeous and delicious. Imagine two thin slices of pear with divine ricotta in between. Little bits of heaven. I never even liked real ricotta, but the raw, vegan version was so good that I started eating off my boyfriend plate, as well. Elizabeth made our Valentine Day wonderful. We will definitely go back to celebrate some other special occasion in the future, and recommend it to other people who want to do the same., I am writing this not because I have eaten here but rather because I have not eaten here. Strange, I know...I had reservations for Feb 24th but the restaurant called to cancel for that evening late last week. They were extremely apologetic and I told them that I simply wanted to try such an interesting concept especially in DC. I said that I would rebook without a problem and that I just needed to coordinate with my group. Today (Feb 22) I receive a package in the mail from Elizabeths Gone Raw! They sent a kind handwritten note from Elizabeth with her apologies and a bag of their Kale Chips which are really fantastic (crispy, cheesy, spicy kale - I wasnt sold until I tried them). BIG KUDOS to Elizabeth and her staff for their impeccable l handling of the situation!!!If this is the high quality and personalized service you receive when you dont eat there, I can only imagine that the full experience is something quite special. I cant wait to try their food and share the experience with my group very soon!, For its vegan, raw cuisine, it deserves 4 stars for creativity. For pure taste, it deserves 3. For value, it deserves 2. Il settle on 3 stars as the average.Overall, it the little things that eat away (no pun intended) at the restaurant polish. The hosts, waiters/waitresses, and the owner are all wonderfully kind people, but they are largely absent for much of the meal. Paired wines and dishes are served with neither fanfare nor explanation, and one cannot rely on one guess to attempt to identify how the chef has transformed the raw ingredients into dishes that appear to contain meat or dairy (but do not).The dishes, likewise, are hit or miss. Kale chips (which take the place of a bread) are pretty good, but relatively bland and could be spiced better. Our initial course, a shaved fennel and spinach tartlet with truffle cream and balsamic sauce, is fine; the truffle cream is quite rich, however, and the best part of the dish -- fascinating that it is made without dairy.Our next course was, sadly, my favorite: a simple salad of red grapefruit, avocado, and baby arugula, with a basil and ginger vinaigrette. The ingredients were simple, fresh, and thoughtfully paired. Yet it is telling when a salad is the best dish of a meal.Our main was easily my least favorite course. We received a wild mushroom napoleon with a parsley salad and pistachio pesto. My qualms about transporting the napoleon concept to non-dessert settings (as chefs do far too often in shows like Chopped) aside, this napoleon simply did not work. Napoleons are theoretically effective because they allow the person eating to take a fork through multiple distinct layers and appreciate the melding of the flavors in one mouth. If you cannot do that, or if the flavors are all the same, the dish fails. This dish failed on both counts. First, the mushroom filling was identical across the layers, and though I love wild mushrooms, these were not nearly as flavorful as I would have expected at a restaurant touting fresh ingredients. Second, the separating layers between the mushroom filling were hard and nut-based, almost like a granola bar. Unfortunately, that meant I had to separate the dish into its distinct components in order to eat it. And while the pesto was good, it lacked the typical richness of pesto and there was not nearly enough of it to save an otherwise intensely dry dish.I believe we enjoyed a intermezzo of some sort of sorbet, which was simple and fresh.Finally, our dessert was quite good, though a tad heavy for me: a pineapple carpaccio with coconut creme.One last, very minor, gripe: most restaurants that serve tasting menus provide you with a copy of the menu when you leave so you can remember your meal; here, no such luck. I had to take a picture of mine to recall what we ate.All in all, it was an interesting and creative meal, though not one that blew me away or compels me to go back. Still, if one is limited to a vegan or raw diet, this is easily as good as it gets in DC. (An aside for those unfamiliar with raw food: the day after, you may not feel wonderful; Ie eaten street food in Brazil, Turkey, Egypt, and other places, yet this was the food that set my stomach doing somersaults the next day) I think EGR excelled when it let the ingredients do the talking, without too much dehydrating or recrafting or transforming. Indeed, at lrpege in Paris I had one of the best meals of my life eating predominently fruits and vegetables., I was excited to try Elizabeths Gone Raw since its gotten such great reviews here and elsewhere, and had heard it was fantastic. I was accepting of the high price point because Ive eaten at other very pricey places and know it can be worth it for a special occasion. However, I left Elizabeths feeling taken. The food was decent, not amazing, and a couple of the dishes were fairly unenjoyable because of texture and weird tastes. Since there are only 4 total dishes, having two of them be unenjoyable is pretty bad.We got the wine pairing as a splurge, and at $50/person (in addition to the $75/person for the food, as well as 10% tax, 20% tip), there is no way this place is worth the money. Even without the wine pairing, I cant see how it is worth the money. And Im not anywhere near a cheapskate.If you want a vegan place that IS worth the money, try Vedge in Philly. Sadly, DC is lacking in amazing vegetarian restaurants.Overall, for food, Id give it a 3 1/2, for value a 1, for service a 3. If it was half the price, I might go back, but at this price, no way., Fabulous food and lovely atmosphere. If it werent so expensive, Id eat here more often. (They do offer a great discount for Live Green members, which makes it more doable)., Simply amazing! Atmosphere is unique and fun.Service was amazing.Food was totally amazing. I threw this on my husband just hours before our reservation (which was able to get the day of because of a cancelation) and he was not that excited. He not much of a raw guy. But he smiled and went along. He talked about how good it was for days. At one point he complimented the owner, Elizabeth, on the Kale chips. She then gave him her business card and told us to email her for the recipe. The server was able to fully explain every dish with great detail and was very kind. If it wasn as expensive, we would be back more often, thus the 4 stars instead of 5.Make this a fund date night., Overall, good experience and interesting food. I found the food very beautiful and flavor array to be complex. I especially liked the main courses spinach and shallot spaetzle.For a full review and photos from the meal, see my blog:perfectlysauced.wordpres206, Well we finally got around to eating at EGR. From the get go it was a mixed bag. The service was not very good, 1/2 hour wait for seating when the restaurant wasnt even full? We had reservations after all. We ended up having two drinks at the bar, probably the reason to keep us waiting and didnt really enjoy that part so much. I got the distinct feeling that the restaurant really pushes their alcoholic drinks which are expensive and if you are trying to be healthier by eating raw food isnt exactly what you should be drinking anyway. In retrospect I would have preferred a high class smoothie bar or exotic tea bar or something a bit more keeping in line with healthy living. But that part I could have easily overlooked if the rest had made up for it which it didnt. I have to say the wait staff seemed inattentive and distracted the entire time we were there as though they either werent sure what to do or just didnt care. Not the service one would expect from an establishment that bills itself as a fine dining restaurant. The owner was also markedly absent, not a good policy when ones restaurant is only open one night a week and is so small. As to the food itself, the portions were a bit small with some items tasting good while others seemed bland and uninspiring or off target. The salad was the best part of the meal and thats not saying much. The kale chips were good, but then again Ive eaten lots of really good kale chips so that wasnt a stand out to me. During the course of the dinner, I kept getting an undertaste of nutritional yeast and nuts which bothered me more than usual. Being a vegan I expect a certain amount of that in my food but it seemed to be excessive in all the dishes we sampled as if they rely on those two ingredients as the base for everything. The desserts we received were small, very heavy and unfortunately not as tasty as I had hoped they would be. Honestly Im not sure what the rave reviews are all about. I have had better raw food just throwing things together in my kitchen and at hole in the wall raw places than EGR. And again, considering the price tag we expected superior service and food, and a memorable experience. We were not even provided with a menu to take with us. We ended up spending over $250.00 for a dinner that was disappointing overall to say the least. Sadly we will not be back. DC still needs a really good raw restaurant., I really had no idea what to expect here -- I am not vegan nor have I eaten much raw cuisine. But my wife and I loved it. The food was delicious, creative, and sometimes shockingly good.Our favorites were the onion rings and the broccoli with bacon (actually coconut but not sure how). The food was a pleasure by any measure vegan / raw / or not. And it is that much more pleasurable knowing it is healthy.The servers were so pleasant it felt that each and every one of them was the owner. That is just how they acted.We are already planning our return visit for our next special event (wedding anniversary)., I not a vegetarian, vegan or even a conscious organic produce shopper, but as another review put it the ability to enjoy a meal prepared with love and consideration for my health... is priceless. Every course was delicious and had I not remembered it was raw and vegan, I could have totally forgotten. The creativity of ingredients and preparation was downright inspiring. The only beyond my limit moment was mushrooms used for buns on the mini sliders, but a fork and knife made them doable.I appreciate Elizabeth care, consideration and determination and hope to be back in DC soon to enjoy again., I ate at Elizabeth Gone Raw with two friends and experienced the new fall menu using an array of seasonal ingredients. I am not vegan and have never eaten raw cuisine so unfortunately, my review will be a bit skewed.Firstly, the wait staff is impeccable- food comes out as it is prepared and you wait about 15 minutes between courses (just enough time to eat and digest a bit). Wait staff was extremely friendly and very willing to make any requested accommodations. The decor is victorian and the space is huge- large parties can sit comfortably.From my perspective, I don like cuisine that is created- i.e. making cheese out of nuts, or making a bun top out of a mushroom, noodles out of vegetables. I think that mindset got me off to a less than stellar start at this restaurant.We started with an almond milk soup made with turmeric and saffron. Turmeric is a spice that should not be tasted but I could really taste the flavor and passed on the soup after one sip. The saffron taste was strong as well and I did not enjoy the flavor in any capacity.The salad course was quite good- arugula on a cracker with some type of nut spread that was supposed to resemble goat cheese. While I had some trouble with how certain components of this dish were created, I did like the flavor and found the dish to be very creative. It was well seasoned and quite tasty.The appetizer course was a slider made out of mushrooms and had an interesting cheese-like ingredient in the center. This was hard to wrap my head around and I found it difficult to pretend a mushroom cap was a hamburger bun and passed on this course as well. The cheese-like ingredient was not too my liking and I did not like eating a raw mushroom in any capacity.We had a watermelon sorbet in olive oil to cleanse our palates and this was my favorite part of the meal. The watermelon was perfectly prepared and had just enough sweetness- the olive oil was an interesting and surprisingly wonderful accompaniment. I ate my own sorbet and asked for my friend portions.The main dish was a pasta made of zucchini and cucumber shavings that were cut thin so they resembled noodles. This dish was extremely underspiced and rather bland. It was difficult to eat this cold as well. The noodles were served on top of some type of rice that was crunchy and the two tastes and textures did not mesh well together. I ate a small portion of this course.The dessert was an apple crumble that had a nice flavor and a beautiful presentation. I enjoyed picking out the apples out of the middle of the dish- they were cut circular and were fun to eat. The dessert was not too sweet and tasted rather healthy. Overall a good dessert.In summary- I enjoyed the experience of this restaurant mostly because my friends and I had such a great time together and the service/setting was quite nice. The food was not my taste but I did appreciate the time and effort the chefs put in to create 6 courses around the vegan/raw concept. I would not eat here again due to the expense but would recommend to people that adhere to this diet and/or are strict vegetarians., This place deserves all the praise it gets and I sad I can eat here every Friday for dinner. Amazing experience. My boyfriend and I came to Elizabeth to celebrate my birthday and it was such a special treat! The sommelier, Phil Heyser, is at the top of his game and did an exceptional job with the wine pairing.My favorite dishes served were the wild arugula & fig flat bread, the watermelon-hibiscus sorbet, and the caramel apple crisp. The fig flat bread had macadamia cheese and pickled fennel. It was phenomenal. The sorbet was the intermezzo and the only way I can describe it is soft and innocent. It had such a delicate, delicious flavor that my boyfriend had to reach across the table and stop me from licking the bowl it came in! The caramel crisp came with lemon whipped cream and was divine. The perfect ending to a perfect meal.Don even get me started on those kale chips! They might as well be black tar heroin because they are addictive as all get out! We took a 4 oz. bag to go home with us. They are the best kale chips I have ever had, hands down.Youl pay serious money to eat here, but it worth every. single. penny., I didnt read any reviews before I went to EGR, but I loved the concept of clean, fresh food and, better yet, someone who made vegan food elegant. My husband and I were not disappointed. It was fantastic.We had reservations last Friday for 7:15, and street parking was easy to find. The accommodations really are very lush -- the kind of restaurant where you go on very special occasions, like a milestone birthday or to ask someone to marry you. That said, the place was full. Every table was occupied and it was nice to see families with people visiting (even the guy who looked like Ron Swanson next to us) and groups of women out for girls night as well as couples.Food: The food was good. Visually, it was a work of art and utterly appealing. They do not skimp on presentation. Taste-wise, some courses were outstanding and others were just good. The kale chips, like others have said in reviews, are outstanding -- almost as good as mine! Raw food has its own battle with texture, aside from just the taste and presentation. Elizabeth nailed one and the other two will always be somewhat of a struggle for the American palate.Service: Excellent. I loved that our server told us about a pumpkin spice cocktail and asked if we were hungry enough to begin dinner or if we wanted to pace ourselves and go slowly through the night. Her demeanor was friendly and down-to-earth and it made this Montana girl feel like we could hang out and have a beer and I could ask her questions and trust her responses. All in the midst of luxury!Sommelier: Outstanding. That fifth star is all his. Wow. The pinot grigio he chose not only had a lovely story to accompany it (the full wine experience), but was the best wine I have had in years. Since my husband doesnt drink, I only ordered one glass and it was worth every dime of the $12 we paid for it -- just to talk about wine filtering techniques with the sommelier was worth the price.Price: Yes, speaking of price . . . it is expensive, but Elizabeth is filling that restaurant with some happy vegans and other civilian food types. To me, it was worth it -- once in a blue moon. Its worth weeks of kale shakes and homemade pumpkin soup to save money to have a special occasion with a special someone while dressed up and enjoying this small slice of time and food.Dessert: (Saving the best for last) The chocolate torte and espresso bean sorbet would have earned the other four stars if the service and food didnt. The portions were just the right size and left us hungry enough at dessert that we actually enjoyed the rich sweetness. How often can you say that about a restaurant?~ And now you do get to take the menus with you. I think we may mount that in a frame right next to our parking ticket. (Two hours only -- dont forget!) That $25 charge was barely noticed in the midst of our bliss. ~, Carol W and I still have not switched to veganism and have no plans to do so...ever. Still, when a couple of friends of ours invited us out to dinner on a Friday night at Elizabeths Gone Raw, we gladly took them up on the invitation. Since our previous visit, conceptually, nothing had changed as Elizabeths Gone Raw continues to offer a ever-changing tasting menu of raw, vegan, gluten-free cuisine in an elegant, fine dining setting. However, much had changed for the good in terms of the execution of the food and drink. First, Elizabeths Gone Raw offers a quaint, new cocktail bar on the first floor with a very limited, but well-executed, cocktail selection. I had the Ginger Pumpkin Snap made with Snap Gingersnap Liqueur, Crusoe Organic Rum, Wolavers Organic Pumpkin Beer and Fever Tree Organic Ginger Beer and garnished with flamed orange zest yelp.com/biz_photos/eliz206. It was a perfect fall refresher, boozy, spicy, and enjoyable. After receiving my cocktail, our table was ready, so we were led up to the upstairs dining room. Since EGR only offers a tasting menu our only choice was whether or not to do the wine pairing (we did) and simply wait for the parade of food. The second big change was that EGR had a new executive chef, Jonathan Seningen, who had previously been the executive chef at Sax. We had enjoyed his food there, so we had high expectations for his cuisine at EGR. While we waited for our first offerings, we snacked on Elizabeths signature spicy kale chips, which are surprisingly addictive and the best kale chips that Ive tasted. I forgot to note each of the wines we received each course. However, the sommelier made inspired, unconventional pairings (i.e. a sake with the dessert course) that really worked and accentuated the whole meal. For our meal, we received.... Amuse- Baby Bella with sprouted quinoa, parsley, and lemon yelp.com/biz_photos/eliz206. It was a superb bite and would not be out of place in any conventional, meat-lovers, fine dining establishment. Soup- Warm Red Pepper Soup with fennel, cappuccino, and saffron yelp.com/biz_photos/eliz206. I love soup and this was no exception. Appetizer- Parsnip Gnocchi & Sprouted Red Lentils with black cardamom, and chervil yelp.com/biz_photos/eliz206. An inventive spin on gnocchi! It was flavorful and delicious, but it was definitely not gnocchi. Intermezzo- Grapefruit & Cucumber Sorbet with sel gris, and olive oil yelp.com/biz_photos/eliz206. A refreshing blend of flavors. The sel gris brought out the flavor of the sorbet and the EVOO was nice touch. Entr39e- Celeriac Linguini & Sun Dried Tomato Basil Pesto with black truffle cr38me and sunflower shoots yelp.com/biz_photos/eliz206. It looked like a pasta dish, but it was certainly not linguini. That said, it was delicious made so by the outstanding sun dried tomato pesto and wonderful black truffle cr38me. Dessert- Raw Chocolate Ganache Tart with espresso gelato and thyme sauce yelp.com/biz_photos/eliz206. EGR really does desserts well. I was practically in disbelief with every bite I took that it was a vegan, no-bake, gluten-free dessert. It was rich, creamy, and sweet. The thyme sauce put it over the top! I pushed back from the table satisfied. The only glitch was a problem with the bill, which was quickly fixed. It was definitely not enough to affect my evening. I enjoyed my previous experience at Elizabeths Gone Raw, but this trip was far superior. While I will never forego meat and gluten-filled pastas and bread, Elizabeths Gone Raw doesnt sacrifice complexity of flavor, aesthetically inventive and pleasing presentation, and diner satisfaction to achieve its culinary objectives., Fantastic. Ive been to this place several times and every time I go it is a new and interesting experience.The service is excellent and the atmosphere is quite comfortable -- classy without being stuffy. You get the feeling that youre eating dinner at a friends home (albeit a friend with impeccable taste). While the concept of a raw vegan restaurant may sound off-putting to some people, the food is really quite accessible. Im not a raw vegan nor have any of my dining companions there ever been. No one Ive gone with, though, has ever had any complaints once the food starts arriving -- the quality is just excellent. The most telling example of Elizabeths quality happened when I took my father who would dine exclusively on cow parts if he had his druthers. He was extremely skeptical at first, but has since declared it one of the best dining experiences he has had in DC and has requested to go there next time he is in town. In sum, if you havent tried this place, you should. Youll like it., This place in my opinion was not spectacular as I had expected. I was so hyped up about this place because of other yelpers reviews, which is why I am so disappointed. The amuse which was the white mulberry and fennel was very bland but the mulberry made it a bit better. The roasted white asparagus appetizer was very mediocre. There was not much flavor and I felt i was just eating bitter greens. I didnt particularly enjoy the beet risotto either. It had fennel, cabbage, brussels sprouts and date in the dish, but all i tasted was undressed raw beets. The kale chips are very good though, so i guess that was worth the experience of going to elizabeth gone raw.I did enjoy the smallest portion of the porcini mushroom soup and the lemon chamomile sorbet and the dessert which was not the one listed on the menu (changed at last minute).The place is extremely expensive for the type of food and amount of food. This place is as expensive as my favorite restaurant in DC (Cityzen), but by far not as good. I do, however, respect that theres a vegan/raw food place in DC., My wife and I visited Elizabeths Gone Raw last night for her birthday. It was our first experience at a raw restaurant and the experience was fantastic. The meal is about $75 per person, prix fix menu which is provided on your table. I cannot recall exactly what each of the 7 or so courses were. They were flavorful and filling, but not overly filling. They had delicate flavors which impressed us. A few of the dishes were sufficiently complex that we couldnt really figure them out--we like this because our feeling is that we go to fancy restaurants to get something we cannot make at home, something that will challenge our views of food. I think Elizabeths accomplished this.The service was superb and we were really impressed by the attentiveness, but not overly excessive attentiveness that can be overbearing at some restaurants. We really enjoyed the drinks a lot. They had a great selection of beers, mixed drinks, and wines. In fact, I would like to compliment the sommelier because he was extremely well informed, gave us the appropriate quantity of information, and was generally fun to talk to. We had an Oregon pinot noir, which is one of our favorite locations for a pinot noir. It was great and really made the evening for us. Ill add that we had just watched the movie Somm on Netflix and the sommelier apparently personally knows some of the people profiled in the movie. It made for a fun experience. And his knowledge of wines was impressive as well.We could find only one thing that bothered us both: Elizabeths felt the need to equate flavors to meat dishes. I get it, lots of guests probably have no idea about a raw meal (us included) so its helpful to give some sort of basis for a meal, by for instance saying it tastes like flank steak. We both felt the restaurant should be free to make up new flavors not tied to meat dishes or any dish whatsoever. Its a small thing and it may not bother everyone, but we didnt like it. How can a patron be adventurous enough to try a raw restaurant but not be open to new flavors? I dont know, maybe Elizabeths other patrons dont feel the same way. Its kind of a dumb reason that doesnt warrant deduction of a star, but we left the restaurant kind of unhappy about this small part of what is otherwise a fantastic evening.Id encourage everyone to try out Elizabeths Gone Raw. I could see it not being for everyone, but for a night in which you are willing to step outside of the usual restaurant meal, its an experience worth having., RAW-mazing! This experience was enough to make Elizabeths Gone Raw (EGR) one of my favorite restaurants.For starters, I received a bowl of the best kale chips ever. Elizabeth stopped by and told me they kale is massaged in with cayenne, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, and clearly love. After being dehydrated over night at 115 degrees, it provided a crunchy, spicy, cheesy chip that exploded in my mouth.I am not even sure its fair to boast about what I enjoyed since the menu changes weekly, but my 6-course prix fixe menu included:Amuse-Coconut Bacon Wrapped Date with maple syrup, nama shoyu, and young Thai coconut. It was two bite-sized dates that melted in my mouth. The bacon was formed from the rind of a coconut. I didnt expect to enjoy it since I am not a fan of coconut but it was devine.Start -Split Pea Soup with avocado, black cardamom and smoked ham. The ham was also made with the rind of coconut but the flavor of a smoke ham was very evident. Before this soup, I though I hated avocado but EGR has made me a believer. Simply amazing. The soup was heated in the Vita-mix blender and then served in a warm bowl.-Appetizer-Beet & Apple Ravioli with spinach puree, parsley and fennel foam. This was definitely going to be my favorite because I love beets and apples. As soon as the waitress put my plate on the table, I inhaled it. She didnt even have a chance to tell me how it was made before I was finishing her sentence. This appetizer alone could have been my entire meal and I would have been satisfied. But it didnt stop there...-Intermezzo-Apple & Celery Sorbet with sel gris and olive oil. Just a dollop but enough to cleanse the palette and prepare you for the entree. The marriage of apple and celery was very satisfying.-Entr39e-Pink Banana Squash Cannelloni with portobello mushrooms, spinach, and sun dried tomato. Holy smokes! After eating this, I asked if I could take the menu home. I MUST try to recreate this dish as it was phenomenal. My taste buds were awakened and starting doing the electric slide in my mouth. I almost cried from joy.-Sweet-Chocolate Ganache Tart & Raspberry Sorbet made with raw cacao and coconut. Again, not a fan of chocolate or coconut but this dessert was delicious. It just explained me to that I dont like the processed forms of chocolate or anything that tastes like coconut. Everything I ate was uncooked and therefore the flavor was very evident.Its tricky because the portions do no look like enough to do any damage but by the time I was on my fourth course, I was stuffed. I really couldnt chew anymore but I was reminded of the $75 per person price and I kept chewing. This was also around the time I remembered it would have been cool to take pictures of my experience.Also note the restaurant is only open on Fridays and reservations start at 6PM. If my wallet allows, I will be back Friday and the Friday after that, and the Friday after that., This is my favorite restaurant I have ever been to. I went there for my birthday with a large group of people (including a baby) and the staff were incredibly gracious and accommodating. My sister summed it up well when she said she appreciated the fact that she had just eaten multiple courses of delicious food and yet didnt feel weighed down or bloated. This to me is the best benefit- for me, food doesnt get any more delicious or healthy., Amazing Food!!! Amazing service!!!, Exquisite! The decor, service, ambiance all top notch. The food was near perfect. The appetizer was my favorite, a flax chili cracker with macadamia cream topped with fresh pico de gallo. I couldve had a 2nd helping of that. The entree, portobello mole, fell short. The mushrooms could have been more tender. The sauce nice and spicy though. Having visited most raw food places from around the world being a 15+ year raw foodie I can say I have not quite had a raw food dining experience quite like that. Its great that its here in DC, which has been behind other major metro cities with raw food options., Beautiful, delicioso hidden gem! Discovered this on recommendation of a friend. Booked about 2 months in advance for my husbands birthday as its only open on Fridays. The team was wonderful to work with from the start, sending out personal detailed notes and periodically checking in over phone and e-mail during that time frame. The 7 course meal was flavorful, innovative, and beautifully presented. Would certainly return again for another special occasion. And agreed with the other reviewers - some of the best kale chips Ive ever had!, If I could have given lower I would. Im a vegan. I eat a whole-food plant based diet. No fake meats. I love veggies. Give me some lentils or split peas and Im happy. Elizabeths did not make me happy. Wife and I went there and though I was skeptical I had an open mind. Started with alkaline water which I was not familiar with. I would rather not be served something of questionable health value without my approval. But it was the best tasting item on the menu, which was good as I consumed 9 glasses to kill the flavors of the dinner. Starter was some kind of slimy mushroom thing. Foamy and unpleasant. There was a soup that was pretty good except for a bizarre and overpowering smoke flavor. Fake scallops had an unpleasant texture and odd aroma. A celery apple sorbet left me speechless. The main course was cold squash pasta with fake cheese chips and rather pedestrian sauce. At some point the manager came over and interrupted our meal to apologize that I wasnt having a good time, presumably as He observed that I wasnt really eating much. To the contrary, manager dude. I WAS having a great evening despite the lousy food until you insinuated yourself into the situation and called me out. The dessert was actually good, a very decadent chocolate tart with some fruit sorbet. Too rich to eat much of it but good. In short, I dont get it. The food ranged from inedible to meh, and I felt like the chef didnt care about the vegetables, just this odd culinary exercise of smooshing flavors together. Perhaps I am just not a raw food guy, but as a vegan, I eat really well. People should not confuse this restaurant with vegan cuisine. Its raw which means cold and texturally offputting. Sorry, but I thought this was overpriced and not good, service was fine except for manager dude. You can get better vegan food from a food truck for $8. Next time, Ill do that. And finally, if you plan to give me water with potential side effects, please let me know so I wont drink it. Wife and I both felt awful, and since we didnt eat much, Im going to blame the water, First time at Elizabeths Gone Raw and had a great experience. The food was super interesting and delicious, especially the dessert. The staff was extremely generous and the atmosphere was comfortable. So glad to have found it and want to go back again!, What a wonderful experience! I am vegan, and my husband is mostly vegetarian, but neither of us has much experience with a raw cuisine. Each course was delicious and memorable. The menu changes each week, but I have to give a shout-out to the chestnut and truffle soup amuse and the apple celery sorbet intermezzo. Both were simply amazing! The kale chips are so good that we bought all that they would sell us to take home. The ambiance is elegant, and the food is the opposite of hippy, vegan food (not that there is anything wrong with that!). Its raw, vegan fine dining at its best. Sean was a friendly, informative and engaging server, the courses were served at a perfect pace, and the entire dinner was very refined with artful, beautiful presentations. I highly recommend Elizabeths Gone Raw for a very special night out. Well be going back soon!, This is a romantic environment. I strongly recommend it if youre on a first date, second date or anything., Finally a healthy vegan alternative in DC that is a dining experience. Creative flavors and presentations, great service, and delightful herbal teas, Fantastic food and outstanding service!, 4.25 stars. By now, everyone has probably heard of DC high-end raw food establishment, Elizabeth Gone Raw (EGR). However, recently, EGR started a raw food happy hour where you can at least sample some of their cuisine and determine for yourself whether it is worth the full experience. Based on last night selections, I would argue that EGR isn just for raw food advocates. If you can appreciate culinary inventiveness, then EGR is for you. We started with the kale chips which are covered most aptly in Heather G review. To be honest, Ie never liked kale chips that I haven made myself. Over here, however, they border on a subliminal experience. The kale is perfectly crunchy with subtle acidic and spicy notes to balance the flavor. I imagine they are the best ones I have ever eaten. The grape leaves with tzatziki enveloped a walnut paste within the leaves and were served under a gorgeous and refreshing cucumber and cashew sauce. A BLT salad substituted coconut for bacon, and added sunflower sprouts for additional flavor. Both dishes were excellent with a slight nod to the tzatziki dish. My friend convinced me to share dessert with her, and I quite happy she did so. The strawberry white chocolate cake incorporated strawberry, coconut, and bananas in a delightfully refreshing manner. We gobbled each bite, careful to try and leave enough of the dessert for the other so that each person could thoroughly enjoy this well-crafted morsel. Our total bill was incredibly low (barely over $20/per person) given the quality of the items we ordered. I really hope that EGR happy hours become more of a regular occurrence. The payoff from my piqued curiosity was immense, and for non-raw food eaters, I strongly suggest coming here with an open mind. This isn your typical vegetarian/vegan place where homages to meat inevitably result in some gross soy product; this is a place where flavors are fully thought out and you can appreciate a well-prepared meal and leave your pre-conceived notions about the limitations of raw food forever behind., Oh Elizabeth, I don know how you continue to improve upon your amazing restaurant. But, you do. Elizabeth Petty is the owner of Elizabeth Gone Raw, DC premier upscale raw vegan establishment, which has now been in business for five years. As an outgrowth of The Catering Company of Washington, this restaurant is only open one night a week. During the day, they operate the catering business, then on Friday night, it is transformed into a vegan culinary experience you will never forget.Over time, they have gone through a few raw vegan chefs and the kitchen is currently occupied by Jonathan Seningen, Executive Chef. Best known for his stints at Hook and SAX in DC, he joined Elizabeth in 2012 to learn an entirely different way of thinking about food preparation. As his first position preparing raw foods, I say what he is doing here is extremely impressive. And for my first visit in over a year, I say he continues to improve his craft.On this Friday night, as me and my date awaited the arrival of another couple we were meeting, we started with the Spice Quest cocktail -- one of my favorites. Soon, we were seated, then greeted by the Sommelier, Philip Heyser. As an eccentric, enthusiastic service director, Phillip Heyser brings an air of confidence as he promptly introduced the wine pairings of the evening. Phil really knows his stuff and is happy to take the time to discuss the different wines they offer and how they would best fit each person palate as well as the menu for the evening. After hearing his spiel, Chris and I chose the full wine pairing with dinner.At Elizabeth Gone Raw, the drinks are the only choice youl need to make. After that, it is smooth sailing as the prix fixe menu is presented course by course. This evening started off their famous kale chips at which point I was reminded that I hadn purchased a bag of these in a really long time. I still think these are the best kale chips in the city.The first course, the amuse, was a small bite of Black Truffle Fried Cauliflower served with a sun-dried tomato sauce, marjoram, and cashew cream. Who would have thought that black truffles and cauliflower could be so good? Wine pairing: NV Celine & Laurent Tripoz, Cremant de Bourgogne (2010).Next up was a Sweet Potato Vichyssoise -- a cold potato soup made with sweet potatoes, carrots, carrot juice, avocados, and maple syrup with parsnip cappuchino foam on top. The entire table was raving about this one. There was a sweetness to it that was tempered by the parsnip foam in a way that is almost indescribably good. Wine pairing: Bedell Cellars Taste White, Long Island, NY (2010).Next was the Beet Tartare. This was shredded beets with sweet onions, capers, and cucumber atop a zucchini crackers made with flaxseed and a cashew cream with nutritional yeast. Excellent. Wine pairing: Clos Cibonne Tibouren Rose, Provence, France (2012).The intermezzo was a sweet lemon and rosemary sorbet with sel gris and olive oil.The entree was culinary art at its best. We are talking a Coq Au Vin -- traditionally a chicken dish in wine, but this one was made with wild mushrooms and red peppers with a coconut bacon served with a rutabaga sauce. This dish had so many different flavors that it just about blew our minds. What amazing is that one can even envision something this creative, then make the flavors work together. Wine Pairing: Rex Hill Pinot Noir, Willamette Valley, Oregon (2011).Lastly was dessert -- a White Chocolate Parsnip Cheesecake made with parsnip juice, coconut, lemon, and cinnamon. The crust was made of macadamia nuts and parsnip juice. And it was topped with a parsnip juice foam. It was amazingly rich and satisfying. I felt like I had died and gone to heaven by that point. Wine Pairing: Okanogan Estate Orchard Hill Vineyard Chardonnay Ice Wine, Okanogan Valley, Washington (2006).Chef Seningen has certainly taken his training with Mattthew Kenney to great heights and is commanding respect in his kitchen. I feel like this restaurant is on par with that of Pure Food & Wine in NYC and I only say that as a complement as I have always regarded Pure Food & Wine as the best raw vegan restaurant in the country. The food at Elizabeth is phenomenal and one can only leave there thinking about how complicated it must be to craft such extraordinary dishes. The wine selection is the best it has ever been as each wine not only complements the dishes perfectly, but is also just fantastic wine. For $75 per person and a $50 wine pairing, this is a more expensive experience, but it is one that everyone in DC should have at least once in their life. If you haven been to Elizabeth Gone Raw yet, now is the time to go., The absolute best restaurant in Washington DC for a vegan, and probably in the top 5 for non vegans.The main drawback is that it is open just 1 day a week. Well, I guess the other drawback is it is wicked expensive. I even go there and I make my wife handle everything related to money. I dont want to know. So it is expensive, but being great aint cheap. So they gotta pay people, they only are open 1 day and the ambiance is great. So it is well worth it.Everytime you go the menu changes. They do things with food that I didnt think possible. Everything is a masterpiece. You eat here, not for taste, but for experience. It transends you. If you are considering it, I say take the plunge!, My first prix fixe menu experience and this place did NOT disappoint. Each course was better than the next, and despite the smaller portion sizes, I left very full and happy. The drinks were amazing as well., Many people regard New York Citys Pure Food and Wine as the best raw food restaurant in the country. I believe Elizabeths Gone Raw at least equals it and possibly surpasses it.This is a high end restaurant with high prices and a formal ambiance. The food is masterfully prepared by extremely skilled chefs. They pay painstaking detail to their work. For example, they slice produce (apples, asparagus, etc.) paper thin - the thinnest slice I have ever seen in my life - then dehydrate it to crispy perfection. It may surprise many that the multi-course raw meal is very filling, so I recommend arriving hungry. Although expensive, this is a true dining experience - one that is worth the splurge for romantic meals, special occasions, and the joy of food at its finest., Elizabeths Gone Raw is a fantastic experience. Overall more of a production, performance with a food experience. The building alone is alive and amazing. Lush decorations. Clean beyond current expectations. Traveling to another era. The service is high class. The food is inventive and original. The price matches a Las Vegas Cirque show with all the drama. Watching Elizabeth keep everything going and pitching in was inspirational. The sommelier Phil Heyser was spot on and worked the room adding to everyones enjoyment. I would highly recommend getting the wine flight. I felt like a member of some of the more elite clubs I have had the honor to attend. Grosse Point Yacht Club, The Cricket Club in Singapore, and those posh London Clubs have all met their match with Elizabeth. I found the price fixed menu takes all the stress out of ordering Vegan Raw foods adding to the feeling of being taken care of in a private club. Knowing the strong staffing brought to the night I felt the price was a little low relative to the event. We stayed about 2 hours for the whole production and could not do anything in Washington DC afterwards to match. Thanks Elizabeth, Really creative food, and amazingly presented. The server painstakingly explained every course brought out - what the ingredients were, and exactly how it was prepared. Cool experience overall., This place is what I consider a once-in-a-lifetime experience, largely because of the price tag. Fine dining is not the sort of setting where I comfortable, and the food has to be really, really, out-of-this-world to make me forget how much I paying. Elizabeth Gone Raw ALMOST hit that mark. Almost. I will say that the food here made me think differently about food, and that was the biggest payoff. When I saw the menu, they were clearly going for an Italian theme, but I groaned inwardly because celery, artichokes, and zucchini all featured prominently on it, and those are my three least favorite foods. But Elizabeth Gone Raw delivered not just edible, but incredibly tasty dishes made out of all three. First came the zucchini, which was thinly shaved and topped with a vinaigrette and some capers. Simple? Yes, but the zucchini was very fresh--impressive for a summer squash in winter--and it stood out on its own.The cucumber/apple/celery sorbet floating in olive oil, a course that I was actively dreading, was the biggest surprise of all. The celery overtook the apple in the sorbet, so the first bite made me cringe a bit (I can emphasize how much I hate celery). But the olive oil mellowed out the sharpness of that particular flavor, and when mixed with some salt flakes, made for a very nice and refreshing palette cleanser, which I think was the intention of the dish.As for the artichokes, the main component of the entree was a sausage stuffed with them. The sausage was delicious--rich and flavorful, it blended nicely with a cashew-based basil cream that was drizzled across the plate. The dish was topped with a cracker that looked like a sail, tasted like a cheese straw, and had an odd texture that was probably due to its method of preparation (I going to guess dehydrated instead of baked). Combined with the semi-dried tomatoes that studded the plate, the dish was reminiscent of summery Italian fare.The dehydrated kale chips, as others have mentioned, were delicious, tangy, and brought out by the waiters in a steady stream, to the point where we had to ask them to stop.By far the biggest highlight was the dessert. Two dark chocolate truffles, one with orange filling and one with ginger/cayenne filling, flanked a scoop of pineapple sorbet. They were out of the goji berry sorbet that was promised, but that was fine. The thick, almost bitter chocolate was perfect with the fruit, and the balance of creamy to lightness was just right. The only jarring note in this otherwise beautiful chord was the ginger filling in the truffle, which reminded me oddly of Chinese takeout.My only other complaint about the food was that the amuse-bouche, which was a chestnut soup, was not nearly amusing enough. The flavor, which some might call delicate, was mostly underwhelming and left me coughing with bits of chestnut in my throat. Then again, I guess the amuse-bouche is intended to gently wake up the palate rather than startle it, so maybe it was supposed to be on the subtle side. I like to imagine the chef knew what he was doing.And the service, while very friendly, felt overly stuffy for this kind of playful, fun food. When I mentioned this to a friend at the table, he countered that it difficult for vegans to find a fine-dining atmosphere, so that makes sense. But there were a lot of waiters running around, and it felt quite a bit like a posh wedding--which makes sense, given that they run a catering business the other 6 days a week. It just detracts from an otherwise peaceful atmosphere when waiters are politely peering out at you from the kitchen every 5 minutes or so, coming up to take your plate, then realizing youe not done and gracefully walking away.The sommelier was wonderful. I think I was expecting snobbery because Ie never interacted with a sommelier before, but he was friendly and got us just as excited about the wine and cocktails as he was. While we didn do the $50/person wine pairing, he did help us pick a nice bottle of white (forgive me, I don remember what it was) as well as some cocktails. When I asked about gin drinks, he recommended a handmade goji berry tonic-type soda with...some kind of organic gin. They even found a way to replicate a dark and stormy for my boyfriend. All were delicious. Another reviewer described this a more of a production than a meal--I would partially agree with that, but despite its general daintiness, this is a meal that will leave you satisfied, but not overly stuffed. Your wallet, however, might be a little worse for the wear., This is the kind of place where a lot of people around you will be taking pictures of the room and the food. Do not be one of those people. The space is cool and elegant. The staff is professional without being stuffy. Drinks were fine, but not spectacular. Then wine list notes whether the bottle is organic, sustainable or biodiverse (I think thats the third category). Thats a little too precious for me. Overall the food is delicious. As with all concept restaurants, some things work better than others. Quinoa, for instance, is better cooked than raw. The truffle garbanzo cake was a little hard and didnt make the best use of the truffles. But some of the dishes are very inventive and taste great, like the ice creams. And I give them credit for doing a raw beet salad - that takes courage. Kale chips were especially addictive. The portions work fine for a tasting menu. We were nether hungry nor stuffed at the end. Its an expensive experience, but a fun one., Elizabeth is an upscale raw / vegan DC restaurant, only open for diners Friday evenings. The rest of the week, they are a catering company. But you can tell that their passion is of the raw / vegan variety. What an outstanding passion it is! Heart and soul, creativity and detail are manifest in each course. Starting with the amuse-bouche of green tomato soup that is concocted with almond milk and yacon creme, kale chips are presented as well for unlimited snacking pleasure. The official starter then is the forest mushroom and asparagus salad. Most impressive was the coconut bacon in this course. Amazing - I was convinced! Next was the appetizer of cheese (really nut) which was truly splendid and at this point I started to become convinced that I could eat raw / vegan far more often with some creativity. Intermezzo divided the dining experience with a mulberry and pink grapefruit sorbet. Now this was served with olive oil, which requires a more sophisticated palate. I appreciate the unusual clever combination here and applaud the risk! Bravo!The next course was the entree of black caviar roll with anise creme. The ingredients here included pearl onion, maca powder, onion, and dill. Heavenly! I ordered a Pinot noir at this point to complement the entree, and it was well-paired with the underlying earthy tones of the course.Last but definitely not least was the dessert - a not so sweet but very satisfying hemp seed cracker and Sunkist Orange mousse with candied pistachio and fresh raspberry. My oh my! That mousse was out of this world. Such a wonderful combination here, and at this point I was quite full! Elizabeth and team were wonderful. The owner and namesake Elizabeth Petty herself walked around and chatted with us, refreshed our kale chips, and gave me some tips for incorporating more raw / vegan into my diet as I had just finished a three day juice cleanse and felt ready to establish a holistically healthy lifestyle. The whole wait staff was so friendly and down to earth, answering any questions we had about the drinks and food. The setting is gorgeous. It can be rented out any day of the week (besides Friday)! Its two floors are romantic and cozy, yet still spacious. Bravo to the venue!, As DC locals and vegans for a couple years, Im surprised that it took us so long to try Elizabeths. So far, out of a handful of raw restaurants this is the only one that weve really enjoyed... and it was quite exceptional. Though it is expensive and only open one day a week... Friday, it makes for a unique date-night meal, and is convenient to many theaters etc. Elizabeths is a culinary experience worth trying, if only once (for the price tag?) and regardless of if youre vegan. They truly do a fantastic job elevating vegetables and creating complex tastes and textures that you just wouldnt expect from a raw restaurant. For what it is - high end raw/vegan dining - I would imagine that Elizabeths Gone Raw is the best in the country!, This place was fun. Set multi course menu with optional wine pairing. Food fun with different ingredients ( like dragon fruit). Nice to have upscale inventilve vegetarian food as opposed to a thoughtless pasta or salad. The setting was beautiful, elegant, and quite unexpected. Renovated rowhouse decorated in a very splendid manner. Will come again., This review is for Elizabeth on L as an event venue.We were so thrilled to hold our wedding ceremony and reception at Elizabeth on L. From our first meeting to the wedding itself, everything was handled with professionalism, grace, and hospitality! We love the mission of the raw restaurant -- in fact, one of our first dates was at Elizabeth Gone Raw -- and working with Elizabeth herself, her sommelier Phil, and her wonderful event manager Emilie was a dream. Together, they orchestrated a beautiful day for our small group (around 40 guests total) and helped us make the most of our vision without extravagance or complexity.More details, for other couples thinking of celebrating at Elizabeth! For us, the venue made sense since it allowed us to pay only for food, drink, and labor, rather than material or space rental. The decor is already elegant and stunning, which meant we brought almost nothing with us in terms of additional decoration, and the staff even held on to the floral arrangements from Friday dinner for our Saturday wedding! Since there were no events planned for later in the day, we were given the option to extend our midday celebration past the planned ending time -- which we gladly seized on the day of. Emilie helped us design the perfect flow of ceremony to hors deuvres to luncheon to toasts, ran all the music from one of our iPods (including processional and recessional music!), and helped us enter and exit the ceremony with ease. She is a real pro, and in addition to nailing all of the logistics she found a way to fill the day with little grace notes, like playing music for a private first dance when the groom and I wound up being the last to depart the venue, keeping the bride watered and well-fed (thanks also to Elizabeth on this one!), making sure our paper goods were recycled after the ceremony, and sending a charming thank-you note soon after the day itself.It was an honor to celebrate with such fine people, and we would do it again in a heartbeat., Came here with bf for his Bday. They were nice enough to put his name on his menu as a keepsake. Atmosphere and staff are wonderful- very friendly and intimate. Gorgeous space. Unlimited kale chips are DELICIOUS. All the six courses were wonderful. Beautiful presentation and taste. Wonderful mingling of flavors. Im a raging carnivore and I was completely satisfied. Theres an on-site sommelier who recommended a wonderful wine to pair with our dishes. Overall, highly recommended for a special occasion!, This is a true dining experience. The building, the ambiance, the creativity of the food, and of course, trying things you have never tried before - and liking it. My favorite was a cauliflower soup with a parmesan-like foam in a cappuccino cup. I also appreciate that they offer original, non-alcoholic cocktails so that non-drinkers can also have a special drink with their meal.It is a fixed menu so everyone gets the same, with dietary considerations taken into account. They had a menu on the table so that you can read about and anticipate your food. Only suggestion is that they have one for each person.I went with two girlfriends for a fancy ladies night out and would highly recommend it., I am a long-time vegetarian (darn close to vegan) so lets be real: my food standards are not particularly high. If it wasnt killed, Ill probably eat it and be happy. Even thrilled. Unfortunately, despite having waited years to go to this restaurant, I found the food to be so unappetizing that I cant figure out how all the 5-star reviews made it in here. To even the scales, I am writing this review.The service was superb; there is no doubt about it. Ambiance, quite lovely. The food itself was flatly unpalatable. There was a cold pureed cauliflower soup of some sort, I believe, to start, that tasted so bad but I didnt want to tell my date because it was Valentines Day. On to the papaya-wrapped something or other that was (not kidding) SLIMY. Oh God. The microscopic portions kept coming and I was mortified that everything was slowly killing my tongue, but it really was. The dessert, thank goodness, was chocolatey and delicious, and I could have had more. Phew. On reflection, I might even give EGR three stars for the dessert except for the inexplicably monstrous bill for two people. I do not say this for exaggeration for my Yelp review, but the portions were so tiny that we came home and had a snack. For over $200 for two people, I cant justify three stars. Sadly, we will never be going back., I liked it overall; the service was very good, everybody was very nice. The food overall was good except for a palate cleaning dish they gave us consisting of a sorbet sitting on a lot of oil and sprinkled with a lot of salt. I didnt like this at all. Sorbet/ice cream sitting on oil is not pleasant to eat. Plus, they added too much salt to it. I still dont get the idea of salt on top of ice cream and ice cream with oil! Yuck! Plus, the oil gave me heartburn., This place is worth the high price.Its only for special occasions, but it never disappoints. Its incredible how much detail goes into every dish. One of the dishes, we were explained, was dehydrated for 24 hours; it was an artichoke ravioli with a side of macadamia & truffle stuffed squash blossom. That was the star of the night!The desserts are always so tasty! We had a trio of ice creams. I just wish I could have gotten more of the peach ice cream., The most amazing restaurant!My fianc39 and I went to Elizabeths Gone Raw to celebrate our engagement. He was going to propose there but decided he was too embarrassed to have people watch. Fortunately, we still went out after I said yes because we have been talking about going to Elizabeths gone Raw for almost a year. Anyways, the starter was beet tartar. Tiny portion on a spoon and fantastic. The second plate was green strawberry and tomato salad perfectly presented. After this, they gave us kale chips. So good! I think they must have put nutritional yeast and some other spices on top and it was phenomenal. I wish I had the time and skill to make these on the regular or they sold them by the bag. Third was avocado gazpacho. Literally the best soup I have ever had. I actually dont like soup at all but this might have been my favorite part. Intermezzo was something like a cucumber gelato. The main entree was artichoke ravioli. I think it had a salt foam and maybe some chocolate somewhere. I could be totally off because this dish was more complex than I could comprehend and amazing. Last was three ice creams. One chocolate, one apricot, and another vanilla bean.We also had wine, cocktails, etc. and the bill came to about $300. Totally worth it. If I won the lottery I would eat here every day (except they are only open on Fridays). My fianc39 is a big italian guy who loves to eat and we were really concerned he would still be hungry afterwards but he was really full. Though the portions are somewhat small, there are six courses plus kale chips so you are not at all hungry after. The inside is beautiful and service is great. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone, vegan, vegetarian, or omni., The food here is incredibly detailed in plating and marriage of flavors, with careful culinary thought applied from start to finish. The venue is beautiful, the staff is polished perfection and the courses are non-stop aesthetic and gastronomic delights.Caveat: the only reasons I award 4 instead of 5 stars are because of the limited hours (1 night a week; torturous!) and the lack of choice for the meal. Yes, I understand it a prix fixe, but, some ingredients some people may not like, and with the cost, I would tip my hat off to the chef even more if they had at least 2 of the 6 courses as a choice between 2 dishes. I can even imagine the prep time for their amazing courses, but, why not raise the bar further? However, if Friday is perfect for your schedule, and you love everything raw and vegan, then 5 stars, no questions about it.There are happy hours, but those are also limited, and I have never attended one, so this is just for the food.When you enter the building, it is as cute as can be. There is a small bar area to greet you and allow you to have an aperitif before your reservation and/or party is/ are ready. The decor is exquisite, boasting a style of an as expected wealthy DC row house with classic style attending to a theme that coordinates the chairs, flowers, stairs, carpeting, flooring, wall coverings, lighting, and everything else possible. It a beautiful affair from the moment you enter.As you are invited upstairs and escorted to your table, you will notice the quiet, intimate setting. It is amazing that the staff rush around with such focused composure. The dress code of the staff reflects that of the customers - polished and semi-formal. Water is, as expected, always provided when needed so that your cup is never empty. The wine pairing is optional, but I have never partaken in it.The staff rotate around in bringing your dishes, so you will have several people helping you, explaining and identifying the dishes. If you are lucky, Elizabeth herself may bring you a course!Every meal has an amuse, start, appetizer, intermezzo, entree and sweet, along with kale chips of some sort. Since the meal is raw, the key is to go during a time of year when you appreciate the produce the most. Winter and fall, expect squashes, spring and summer, expect fruits and greens. Also, despite what you may believe, you will not leave hungry. Vegan raw food is filling, and when there are 6 courses plus kale chips, you will be quite full, possibly so full that you needn eat breakfast as soon as you wake the next day.I love the size of the dishes, because that is what is most fun: trying as much as possible. That is my favorite part of this meal. When can you go somewhere and as an individual order 7 different dishes? You will only receive strange looks, and likely, you will end up with much to take home. Here, the portions are perfect.The themes vary, but there seems to always be some sort of soup and sorbet. These are impressive - they are not your standard soups and sorbets. The blend of ingredients is simple but balanced with fresh, vibrant ingredients and flavors - I would never place salt and olive oil as a garnish for sorbet, but it is perfectly executed here. The soups are not a chopped up mix of vegetables but a delightful blend of fruit and vegetable juices, with elegantly placed pieces of fruits and vegetables. This recent menu item of Yellow Watermelon Soup had a cherry tomato filled with a smoky cashew yogurt - brilliant. The menu also tends to have an item with an avant garde theme of some cracker, some foam and something else. This time, the item was a soft red wine nut-based cracker with kelp caviar and green apple foam - how they made the caviar from kelp is beyond me. A chef deuvre for the vegan raw repertory, but for the culinary world in general. The entree and sweet courses were also stellar, though not nearly as earth-shatteringly creative as the caviar, the flavors were extraordinary blends with beautiful plating. Yes, you can eat chocolate as a raw diner, and yes, raw papaya can be used for more than just salad. Accolades and kudos to the chef and culinary team at Elizabeth. This is the best high end raw vegan restaurant in the country, period. If you know of another one... message me.Can wait to go again, but, I just have to be ready to justify the price. For 6 courses and kale chips, it is a steal at this magical venue, but if you are like me, you will likely only venture here for special celebrations in life. Cheers!, Went for our anniversary dinner a few weeks ago. Everything was amazing. Our server was friendly and a little silly, which was nice in such a formal setting. Ill start off with the atmosphere. The dining room is beautiful and charming. You walk in to the restaurant and can almost forget that you are in the middle of DC. We both chose to have the wine pairing (which was nice because we didnt have to make decisions on drinks - but the cocktails looked amazing) The entire meal was amazing and an experience that you could only have at EGR. Im still dreaming about our beet amuse-bouche.As the other reviewers have noted, the kale chips are very good (definitely not your typical kale chip)!We both agreed that the meal was definitely worth the slightly high price tag. Dont let that deter you from an amazing, one-of-a-kind meal., Only open on Friday evenings, we were able to get a reservation for 6 while visiting Washington DC. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by an employee. We didnt have our entire party there yet, so we were asked to sit at the bar and order drinks and have their kale chips, which was delicious!!Walked upstairs to our table, the decor is nice and romantic and dimly lit. Servers and wait staff have the greatest attention to detail, any crumb on the table is swept up immediately. And I liked how they described each dish when serving. They made it very interactive and we all had more an appreciation for the food before eating it.Every Friday the menu changes, so we had the following week of July 31st, a prix fix only menu.- (4 stars) Summer Peach Salad: this was very good, although we all wanted more, it was a very tiny portion, and because we liked it, we were disappointed to only have a little of it. They should have given 2 each to the customers to satisfy the cost and flavor.- (5 stars) Cantaloupe Soup: very refreshing, I am not a fan of cantaloupe but the soup flavor was really good.- (5 stars) Heirloom Tomato Salad: loved the plated presentation, there was a bubble of basil which was very interactive and fun to eat. - (5 stars) Raspberry Sorbet: delicious and refreshing, was a little weird with olive oil, but it tasted pretty good with it.- (0 star) Roasted Beet Terrine: entree was too dry and tasteless, I was very disappointed in this entree. All the other entrees before this were amazing and was I excited to try out the next one, but this entree was not up to par as the rest of them were. Everyone at our table hated it.- (5 stars) TCHO Chocolate Mocha Cake: This was really good, glad we were able to end the meal with a delicious dessert, especially after that horrible beet entree. We loved the strawberry sauce and the cake flavors.Overall I would definitely recommend this place for a special occasion. The food overall had great flavors, just make sure to check the menu on their website a few days before, just in case you dont like something in particular, as you cant choose your own items. Stay away from the beet entree!, Excellent food and romantic atmosphere and superb service.In another life, I did 14 years of restaurant business in DC area. Unlike NY or Chicago, DC metro region is dominated with corporate chains and concept stores. I really thought that we had lost the good old fashioned fine dining service in this area until my wife and I walked into Elizabeth Gone Raw last Friday. I was and still am a carnivore. We both completely enjoyed the experience. Kyle, Dan, Phil, Sean, and Elizabeth herself worked to make us feel as especial and important as the food that they so artfully prepared. We were educated, entertained, papered, and deliciously feed. I will only be glad if I had to wait to get a reservation, they are that good, did I mention that I am a carnivore?, Things to know about this restaurant: 1. They serve only raw vegan food 2. Only open on Fridays3. Make reservations, its better! 4. 6 course meal prix fixe menu: served in smaller portions. If youre a big guy, you may not get full. 5. $75 per person; price is more expensive if you want to do the wine pairings. 6: Kale chips are so delicious! (Not included in the 6 courses, they will give it to you as a snack, so no need to ask)7. They change their menu every week! So every time you come its a surprise Elizabeths gone raw was definitely on my list of restaurants to try while visiting in DC. Me and my boyfriend were visiting from LA so we might as well go all out on food. Im a vegetarian and hes a straight up carnivore, so I was so touched that he was down to try an all vegan restaurant for me while we were on our trip. The decoration here is so beautiful. It looks like an old cozy house that they just turned into a restaurant. Me and my boyfriend were the first people there at 6pm sharp. We sat at the bar first to order our drinks and then headed upstairs to get seated. I got some strawberry cocktail ($14) which was pretty good. There was a mixed emotions of flavors running through my mouth; it was sweet, salty and sour all at the same time. Pretty cool lol Where do I even begin with food?! AmuseChanterelle Ravioli: this was my favorite out of all the dishes. The texture of the pasta was nothing like real pasta, but the flavors in the ravioli and the sauce surrounding it made up for it. StartWhite Corn Soup: I also liked this dish because it had truffle in it. Im a HUGE truffle fan, so put it in any dish and I will love it. They give you a BIG piece of truffle inside the soup as well. Places in LA just give you thin shavings, but this piece was super thick. I didnt like how the soup was cold though, Im just used to drinking soup hot. Appetizer Coconut Heart of Palm Carpaccio: I enjoyed the black seaweed caviar that was on top of this dish, but I wasnt a fan of the sauce or the coconut itself. The coconut had no flavor to it so it tasted like I was eating a raw crunchy vegetable. IntermezzoSour cherry and lavender sorbet: YUM! This was so delicious that I ate my boyfriends as well. I dont normally like cherry, but I didnt think this tasted like cherry at all. It was really refreshing, icy and sweet. EntreePoached Green Asparagus and Sage Tabouli: the asparagus itself was really enjoyable. They poached it in water for 3 days so it definitely fattened up the asparagus and gave it an awesome crunch to it. I also loved the coconut bacon, it didnt taste anything like bacon of course, but I loved the texture because it felt like I was eating candy. I didnt like the tomatoes in the tabouli that much, because Im not a tomato fan, but if they just had the cucumbers I would have liked it more. The apricot egg yolk really looked like an egg yolk to me, I was so impressed. But the taste was kind of bland, I wish it was more sweet because when I think of apricot I think of the sweet fruit. Dessert Mango and Black Pepper Ice Cream with a Chocolate Brownie: I loved the ice cream, I forsure tasted the hint of the black pepper and I surprisingly enjoyed it. The chocolate brownie was so hard for me to eat, I usually dont like chocolate in general, so I was wondering if I would like vegan chocolate, and I forsure just couldnt eat it loll. The texture was just so gross. It was really pasty, dry and bland. Even with the ice cream, it did not taste good. The thing I love about this place is that the workers describe every single dish in very good detail. They tell us exactly what the dish is, what everything is made out of, how they cook it, and how long they cook it for. I find it so interesting and fascinating how chefs can mimic meat/seafood dishes, but make them out of completely different ingredients., This was truly the best meal we have ever had. Seriously. We went for Valentines because my bf is a vegetarian, and I wanted him to be able to eat everything on the menu.The restaurant is usually only open on Friday nights, but they were open specially on Saturday for Valentines day. I called a week in advance and had to be put on a waiting list; there was finally an opening for 9 pm on Saturday, and we took it gladly. There is a set menu with several courses for every Friday (which you can see on the website in advance). There are also signature cocktails and a wine pairing. Every single course was exquisite, and the endless kale chips were amazing. The service was wonderful-- it really made us feel like VIPs! The owner, Elizabeth, even came out and introduced herself. In addition to all that, the space is beautiful and welcoming. Its fairly formal, and you will need to dress up a bit!This was also the most expensive meal weve ever had in our life, even without the wine pairing and cocktails. BUT it was totally worth it. I plan to go back again as soon as theres an occasion that gives me an excuse!, On our first night in DC we decided to splurge and make it a special evening . We we arrived wet and hungry after visiting some of the national monuments in the pouring rain . The place was warm and cozy inside. We had a drink at the bar while we waited to be a sat . The cocktail I had was one of the best Ive ever tasted . The dinner was superb , each course making us happier .The Sommelier was very sweet and helpful . We really liked him . Elizabeth was very kind and friendly . The chef is a genius ! The sprouted lentil dish that was our main course ,was innovative and delicious. The standout dish was a strawberry/beet sorbet with citrus . A truly inspiring meal. We left feeling happy and satisfied. Besides the mishap with my reservation , everything was perfection . Thank you !, If there were ten stars, the sun and the moon, I would give it to Elizabeths Gone Raw. We had the five-course wine paired dinner and every second of every minute and every swish of my tongue and gentle movement of my mouth cherished each of the five courses. My mouth didnt want to swallow but my stomach said you must let go. The staff were simply amazing and this place doesnt belong on this earth. It was how I would imagine being a character in Alice In Wonderland and Dining with she and the Mad Hatter. This is hands down the best meal Ive ever had and Ive dined out a lot for decades all over the United States. I will fly to Washington, D.C. From Los Angeles To dine here again. Its worth the trip. #beenthiswaybefore, I went with 2 friends for dinner on Fri Oct 30th. It was our second time there and we LOVE Elizabeth Gone Raw. We will definitely make it a point to visit every time wee in DC! When we arrived we sat at the bar for a little and enjoyed some mixed drinks. As always, they were very creative and delicious without being overly sweet. Can remember the name but the one I ordered featured sesame and ginger flavors. The ginger was pleasant but not overpowering. Overall the drinks at Elizabeth are excellent and totally worth the ~$15The 1st course was a hempseed cracker with avocado mousse and dehydrated grapes. The cracker was very savory and had nutritional yeast in it, giving it a slight cheesy flavor. The mousse had a creamy consistency and the grapes provided sweetness. It was a great combination of flavors to get started.The 2nd course was a butternut squash soup with macadamia sage cheese and Dnjou pear foam. It was a pretty generous portion for a tasting menu which was great! The soup was a delicious seasonal dish without being overpowering. It was also slightly sweet, seemed like they may have added some coconut or almond milk. The macadamia cheese was a great accompaniment since it was very hearty and flavorful.The 3rd course was orange carpaccio with cherry tomatoes, baby kohlrabi and pickled red onions. I wasn expecting much from this dish but it defied my expectations and was spectacular!! The thinly sliced oranges provided sweetness and the accompanying sauce added a slightly spicy taste. The tomatoes had been dehydrated and the skins were removed. Our one friend who is on record as being totally nauseated by tomatoes actually ate it and liked it! The pickled onions were really flavorful. Somehow this dish composed of extremely simple elements was able to hit most of the major tastes in a way that melded well and didn cause clashes. The wine pairing was a dry Riesling which had great synergy and also contrast with the flavors of the dish -- even though I know nearly nothing about wine, I could tell this was expertly paired.The 4th course (palate cleanser) was a cranberry sorbet with olive oil and sel gris (a type of granulated salt). Unlike most cranberry dishes, it wasn overly sweet. They simply blended beets and cranberries to make the sorbet -- there are no other ingredients. The beets added a beautiful color and mellowed the flavor but weren overpowering.The 5th course (entree) was a tree-nut tenderloin with garam masala carrots, porcini creme, fennel, and caraway seeds. The nuts are soaked in water, finely ground, shaped into a loaf and dehydrated to solidify it. The tenderloin is a definite contender for most delicious thing Ie eaten in my life! It was packed with deliciousness and melted in your mouth. The accompanying porcini mushrooms, creme, and carrots were tasty and completed the dish. Everyone at the table was shocked by how good this entree was.The 6th course (dessert) was a ginger semifreddo, an Italian dessert meaning half-frozen. It was topped with a cookie and a raspberry sauce. This dish was the only one we found disappointing. While traditionally, semifreddo are made of ice cream and whipped cream, with a mousse-like textue, this one was very icy in texture. The cookie on top was nearly impossible to eat in a civilized manner because it was very hard to break with just a spoon. However, the cookie tasted good. The ginger flavor was biting and overpowering, which wasn helped by the accompanying dessert wine, whose bubbles seemed to only further abuse my tongue. None of the three of us like it. However, since the other courses were so amazing, this was still definitely a 5-star experience! Looking forward to coming back in February!
21|estadio-washington|Went here opening night and all in all enjoyed it. The wait for the table was minimal, and allowed for a quick (and tapas sized drink) at the bar. Both the wine and beer selections, though minimal are pretty good. There isnt a wide selection of tapas but that allows for picking some from each category and pretty much everything was good. The tortilla was a bit odd, but the cheese and meat selections were excellent.Overall a good place, the waiter was terrible, easily the worst Ive had in five years but the staff otherwise was quick. We saw our waiter twice, once when (15 minutes after we sat down) he came to us to ask if we needed anything and take our order, and the second time well after we had finished eating. But if the staff is the only thing that needed a few kinks worked out its a good place to go., Blame it on the ah ah ah oh ah co al co hol, blame it on the ah ah col al co... Or... not nearly enough of it. As hard as I tried to get lubed up (because of the company I was with) during our promised 45 (x2) minute wait, my attempts were thwarted by basic supply and demand fundamentals. We ended up hanging out by the end of the bar and watched someone slice meat, which was a pleasant distraction. Try the Slushitos... before they are gone.... because they will be by 8:30 if I recall correctly. The drinks that I was able to try, however, were thoughtfully crafted and not too sweet a-la craft drink material that has been popular on the west coast for years.Things improved when we sat down. The floor to ceiling glass on Church street provides a great fishbowl onto 14th street (both in and out). The wine selection runs the gamut between affordable and I have f.u. money but theyre all going to be good- you know it given this places pedigree. Our waiter certainly tailored to our tastes when we said we wanted something earthy yet smooth yet modestly tannic yet fruit forward... with peach overtones and a hint of dirt. PS try the Finca Allende 2004 Rioja.Do the heirloom tomatoes, most of the sandwitches, the skirt steak, the hen of the woods mushrooms, and the charcuterie - theyre all good, but you might want to steer away from the deviled eggs, and the slippery (on one end) and overcooked (on the other end) octopus. The food is simple, rustic, and just as food from Spain is meant to be- it highlights the underlying ingredients more so than getting lost in their preparation.If you are worried about your current (emaciated, starving looking) state (unless you are going for that) be wary that the cheaper menu items, ie those $4 or so and less, are Barbie size portions and are not meant to be shared.There was a local celebrity there, which was cool, especially if you are into blogs. If you are in search of DCs in crowd theyll be there... this week... until they move onto the next hot new opening.Dinner Id give 4 stars, because I cant give 3.5. If I could give the bar a separate rating, 2 stars because I cant give 0 stars or 1 star. I could give the overall experience 3 stars because I dont know how to average like that., The good news is: the food is delicious. We had halibut, scallops, chicken, shrimp, cheese, pea shoots, rapini, egg tortilla, etc. Everything is very good.The bad news is: the portions are rather small - tapas plus, I would say, and two dishes do not a meal make, while three dishes can make for a very expensive meal (and still make you want a little more).So, if you are in the neighborhood, and are not overly hungry, or dont care what it costs, this is the perfect place for you., Although I wish Estadio took reservations, we didnt wait at all for our table of four once our entire party arrived. We were a bit disappointed, however, that we had to share a 6-top with some other couple. The drink menu is quite nice and the one beer they have on tap is very pleasant. The sherry drinks are also really enjoyable- I recommend the orange one. We had quite a variety of tapas and all were very good except for the chicken on a skewer- sadly, the chicken was of low quality. The halibut was exceptional, as was the tortilla espanola and the salmon open faced sandwich. The service was only adequate and as a result of the skewer, I will only give three stars this time around but look forward to visiting again in the not too distant future., The interior was beautiful and nicely done. I found the bar staff nice but not too friendly which they will have to adjust if they want folks like me, who live in the ood, to come back regularly. Once they know you are neighbors, you would think they would try a bit harder.Food -- very small portions -- I like the reference in another review to the barbie sized portions. Please don call something a sandwich if it isn bigger than a silver dollar -- it is a taste - not even two bites!Loved the slushies but at $9, it seemed the glass could have been a little fuller. Yes, wines at 4-6 dollars a glass -- but they were small measured pours. If it was Pilar or St Ex up the street, the glass would have had twice as much for a dollar or two more.They do take the time with home made cocktails including their own tonic water which I look forward to having when they are not completely out of it by 6pm -- tonic water?? really - you didn know how much tonic people would drink?I will let it settle down before braving the crowds again., Once you settle in, this place is really good.Initially, it takes a while to get acclimated, because it is terribly cramped in here. Like terribly. Common tables that might otherwise normally sit a party of four are shared by 6 people - and they will sit people next to you that you dont know until its full. All of the tables are extremely close together and I could see how people at one table might need the cooperation of people at another to stand up and leave.However, most of the food was excellent, and the cocktails, wine and beer selections was also top notch. Yes, the pours are small, but then again, the prices are scaled back appropriately to match. We had chorizo (good), cheese (valedeon, a very nice sharp blue), olives (not so good - coupled with whole cloves of uncooked and marinated garlic and cornichons - the olives tasted like cornichons and the garlic looked like the breath of death), steak with chimichurri sauce (very, very good), octopus (not as flavorful as I would have liked, and the salad was really uninspired), an open-faced sandwich with boquaditos (white anchovies), anchovies (the more pungent of the two) and roasted red peppers (the sandwich was fantastic), rapini (fine - nothing interesting, but well-executed) and followed up with strawberry gazpacho with panna cotta and mint (very, very good, but would have loved it if they had added crumbled pistachios for texture and a third layer of flavor), coupled with two beers (green flash IPA, $9), two glasses of red wine (Tres Picos Garnacha, very good) and a a truly outstanding cocktail (tequila, cava, rosemary & grapefruit) for around $110, exclusive of tip. Obviously, these plates are relatively small, but the timing of their delivery could not have been better. Basically, the plates were removed as we finished and the next batch of tapas arrived almost instantly when the table was cleared. Which leads to the service. Although it was absolutely packed, our waiter Charlie, who looked very young, was fantastic. He was affable, efficient, quick and attentive but not everpresent. Really remarkable service - and I have rarely said that since I moved to DC. The team worked well together and provided a seamless experience.In essence, although I initially thought the place would be a nightmare because of the overcrowding, the waitstaff, kitchen and bar made it work. Further, despite the number of people in the place, the designer was smart enough to use what look to be sound-dampening panels on the ceiling - and they really helped. Now if they could only give people enough room to sit....PS: Although their menu (and/or anything else) wasnt up on their website, it is posted here: washingtondc.menupages.c206, Loved it. Excellent food, service and slushitos. Do yourself a favor and try the strawberry. We found it irresistible. We also really enjoyed the mussels, bread with tomatoes/olive oil, etc., scallops...dont waste your time on the figs (sadly, as they are my favorite usually). Also, our waiter was knowledgeable, attentive and enthusiastic. Im not one for tapas normally, but I cant wait to go back., First off, I hate small plates. Like, hate with a loathing from deep in my soul, hate. I get stabby when my friends try to go out for small plates and then I end up getting gouged for the $12 meatballs I end up paying for, when there were 4 to a serving and I maybe get half of one (ahem, I looking at you Masa 14!). This, however, was delicious, satisfying and did not make me want to stab things with my fork (other than to pierce and eat). There were only 2 of us stopping in for a bite, which certainly helped soothe my greed. Anyway, we got a bunch of stuff: two of the barbie-bites (the chorizo pistachio one), cured meat, marinated olives, fried squash blossoms, the steak, octopus, hen of the woods mushrooms and pea shoots. White sangria and a strawberry slushie to drink. It was all really, really delicious. Surprisingly the barbie-bite was just perfect for a tiny appetizer when youe trying to sample a lot and not stuff yourself. The squash blossoms were a little overly breaded, for my taste, but I still enjoyed them. The steak was cooked perfectly and was well seasoned. The octopus was smoky and tender. My favorites, though, were actually the vegetables. I could have made a whole dinner out of those mushrooms and pea shoots, which were simply prepared and tasted very much like a fresh vegetable should (not overly dressed and really showcased the flavor of the vegetable). We sat at the bar, and the bar-tenders were knowledgeable, pleasant, enthusiastic and attentive., Do we really need yet another tapas restaurant? Spanish food is so rich and awesome and it goes well beyond tapas. How about full entrees? One would think all the Spaniards ever eat is tapas.The food is fine, I dont have big complaints about it. Some dishes were good (the figs and the wild mushrooms), other were average (like the mussels and octopus). The long wait for a table is annoying because theres VERY little room to stand and wait comfortably (the bar is small, too crowded and packed with tables around it). Also, who charges $2.50 for EVERY SINGLE basket of bread that contains 4 slices? We ended up asking for more bread 4 times, so at the end we payed $10 for 16 slices of bread!Been there, done that, dont think Ill need to go back., This is just ok. Estadio is a very pretty restaurant with an enormous bar. Pluses include the atmosphere and service. Additional points for a good wine list that showcases some nice choices that are relatively affordable. Minuses for the food, which is just okay and is overpriced. I thought the octopus and duck were below average and the Spanish omelet slightly above average. The cost for some of the small plates, like the duck, is almost as much or more than a main course at a normal restaurant. I know this is part of the small plates game, but Im loathe to go back to a place where I spend $40-$50 per person and leave hungry.ps- Another minus for the stupid watering can-like, wine contraption. It is a little gross to watch people in dress clothes pour wine all over themselves. Maybe if Estadios small plates were 1/3 of the price, it could attract a crowd where this seemed appropriate, but it just doesnt work at an upscale place., food is way overpriced and not very good. chicken skewers were very burnt, and the waiter responded by saying that chicken skewers are supposed to be burnt. yeah, i dont think chicken skewers should be covered in black burnt bits, tasted gross. oh, and the service completely sucked.. while we were ordering, the waiter kept clicking his pen loudly, as if he wanted us out of there as quickly as possible. and, 2 pieces of bread for a table of 4, what the heck is that?? this tapas restaurant stunk, will not be going back there again. too bad, was hoping it would be good., Another gem from the owner of Proof... Estadio is an excellent addition to the evolving DC restaurant scene! Ive been there twice in the past week... food, drinks, service, and decor-- STELLAR!! Im obsessed with their champagne/cava cocktails... typically, I dont care for sweet drinks so I rarely order mixed cocktails; however, I highly recommend the tecolate for an extremely well balanced champagne/tequila cocktail. Im embarrassed to admit Ive already had a majority of the items from the menu... but everything just looked so good I couldnt help but over order. A few of my person favs are the assorted charcuterie plate, manchego/chorizo/pistachio encrusted quince skewers (sooo addicting!), deviled eggs, garlic shrimp, mussels w/ chorizo, beet salad, chicken, and duck to name a few. Oh, and the chocolate bread pudding dessert is ridiculous... this coming from someone who isnt much of a sweets person.I cant wait to go back soon to satisfy my cravings... and of course, get through the remaining selections Ive yet to try!, Tasty food, elegant decor, and spotty service. The highlights: the mixed cured meat plate. Its a good value ($18) with 6 kinds of jamon and sliced sausage. The cheese plate (3 kinds of $11) was possibly my favorite dish- you can go wrong with Manchego but the revelation for me was the Canas de Cabra, a soft and musty goat cheese which was amazing with the preserved fruit that accompanied it.We followed that up with the patatas bravas, another classic tapas that they did well. My friend and I didn realize how we had filled up on our meat and cheese plate so we ordered two of the slider sized sandwiches (each $3.50)- the chorizo picante and the morcilla (blood sausage). The morcilla was earthy and complex and a definite highlight. At this point, we were quite full, which surprised us since at first we felt we hadn eaten much- if youe suspicious of small plates ability to sate your hunger, think again.The only downside: we ordered drinks and the meats and cheeses quickly after being seated. The restaurant wasn full yet, but it took over 25 minutes for them to slice the meats and cheese and bring them to us. We were getting to the point of paying for a drinks and leaving, thinking if they can even bring our first dish out, how are we going to make it through the meal? Our waiter didn make eye contact with us throughout this ordeal, although we sent him beseeching looks. When we flagged another waiter down he lamely said it can take a while to slice everything but then brought the dish over within seconds; it had evidently been languishing in the kitchen. After that things picked up and we enjoyed the rest of our meal., Rundown: Gorgeous fun spot, great food, reasonable wines by the glass (all around $5), great service -hostess was accommodating and the owner came over to say hello!As a huge fan of Proof, I was excited to try the restaurant. My favorite restaurant is Casa Mono in NY (dined there 20+ times), as well as spent considerable time in Barcelona so I have a high bar. Rolled up with friends on Thursday, June 22nd around 8pm and the place was packed. I initially had a reservation for six people at 9pm but decided to brave the crowds regardless after a mix up with friends reduced our party to three. The hostess could not have been nicer about the change and even though she said the wait would be 45 minutes to an hour, we were seated within 20.What we had:-Assortment of meats and cheeses - Yummy, pretty standard but I didnt like that one of the meats had been drizzled with olive oil.-Deviled Eggs - filling was like an mini-egg salad. I loved it since Im not a fan of egg yolks. Delish.-Jamon Wrapped Fig - AMAZING. Get these.-Beet Salad - Nice balance with the Parmesan, endive and orange. -Hanger Steak - Solid dish. Nice sauces as an accompaniment.-Bread Pudding - Ive never had bread pudding before and therefore not a great judge. I was nice. I liked the accompaniments better than the actual cake. The miniature balls of chocolate sprinkled on the please had a slight hint of jalapeno. Yum.Regarding the drinks, Anne and I stuck to wine. Jim had a few slushies and we all tried the porron. Drink prices here are some of the best Ive ever seen. Coming from NY, Im used to wines being over $10 a glass, here none of them are. The porron is fun but the spouts need to be bigger. As mentioned above, the service was great despite being open only a week. The hostess didnt mind us flip flopping on out party size, the waitress answered all of our questions thoughtfully and Mark, the owner, even came by and complimented us on our porron pouring skills! On the way out he shook my hand and thanked us for coming. I told him that I would be back and I certainly plan on doing so!, restaurant was nice...food was good...service is what brought my ratings down...they need to step it up. i felt like the waiter was not interested in service and almost like a diner when they set the check down right as you finish eating., Over-priced, overly impressed with themselves, but they serve some tasty treats.How long is the wait for a party of three? Because we called ahead, but after 6pm there are no reservations for a party smaller than six. An hour you say? Make that more like an hour and a half. OK, Ill be at the bar... trying to hear myself think, it turns out, because this is yet another place where intimate conversation is more a result of having to talk directly into someones ear than a by-product of the atmosphere.The white sangria with tarragon-infused tequila looks awfully small in that glass, but the refreshing kick makes up for the small serving, so Im on board.The food? Wow - chorizo went great with manchego while we waited at the bar, and who doesnt love patatas bravas in a spicy sauce? After three checks with the hostess re: our table, and were finally seated. After all that standing around those are some comfy seats - so comfy you think about all the restaurant chairs that really arent. We go for another round of drinks, along with some prosciutto-wrapped figs, triple cream and bacon sandwich bites, and fried cheese-y balls with little bacon bites inside. Whats wrong there? We follow up with halibut so tender it melts in your mouth, octopus over a German-inspired potato salad, and hangar steak that is perfectly cooked - still nice and red in the middle - over a wee bed of mashed potatoes. We finished off with the panna cotta with strawberry gazpacho and mint - was that a hint of pepper on top? Whatever it was, it provided a great touch to a well-rounded dish.Then came the check... prices are on the high side, but the food is great. And once you have a seat at either the bar or a table, the service is friendly and helpful. But prior to my seat at the bar I couldnt flag down a bartender, and that hour and a half wait... Im glad I gave this place a try, Ill not avoid it in the future, but it wont be one of my standards based on this visit., My boyfriend and I went this past Saturday. We were lucky to grab bar seats after a little wait and gave up our name on the wait list (45 min- 1 hour). Eating at the bar was fun and with the small plates coming at different intervals it was not too bad. The white and red Sangrias are both delicious with hints of interesting flavor like tarragon. Yes, they could be bigger or have less ice, but they are only $6 glass.The food was nice overall, loved the wild mushrooms, adn the blood sausage. The patas bravas were tasty too, but could use more sauce.Overall, friendly staff, good food and drink, fun atmosphere., I purposely saved Estadio for a Monday night because I didnt want to wait forever for a table. Even on a Monday night, they had a full house, and the wait was about 30 min. Its easy to see why. Estadio is a step above all other tapas restaurants in DC, even Jaleo. 4 stars for the food and an extra star for getting the best seats in the house, the row of seats surrounding the open kitchen where you can watch the cooks churn out plate after plate of yummy tapas. The most popular seafood dishes were the shrimp and the octopus and the most popular meat dishes seemed to be the steak and the duck. Everything was sauteed and grilled to order, with the exception of the duck, which seemed to be partially cooked ahead of time and finished in the broiler before being sliced. The common theme running through all of the food was savory, savory, savory, interspersed with little tastes of sourness and sweetness. Yes, this place is pricey and small plates can quickly add up. I would say $35 per person can get you reasonably full, but if you want to feel full like you just ate at the cheesecake factory, then its gonna cost you another 20. -Pickled garlic, pepinillos, and olives. This along with the pickled pepper on the meat plate were the best pickled vegetable I have ever tasted. It had a distinct savory taste that you would not have expected from pickles. -Good size cured meat plate. Serrano ham, fuet, chorizo, salchichon de vic, lomo, terrine, a couple of slices of crusty bread, and one incredible pickled pepper for garnish. My least favorite on there was the lomo. The texture was a little gummy and lean tenderloin is just not as flavorful when cured. I am usually suspicious of terrine and think it might be gamey, but this terrine dispelled my prejudice, and I gobbled it up with gusto. -Pintxos. These little bite size delights of savory and sweetness wrapped in one package is a must. They are cheap enough for you to try all four and decide which one tickles your fancy. -Croquetas de Jamon. Light crispy coating on the outside and creamy savory potato with bites of ham on the inside. They were a little on the salty side because of the ham, but still very tasty. -Warm lionesa. This was not really bacon like the kind you have for breakfast. It was more savory than salty. The cheese was also curiously savory and buttery (I should have asked which cheese they used). -Chorizo bocadillos. Slightly warm slices of chorizo on a mini crusty bun. This wasnt bad, but seemed kind of redundant after the meat plate we ordered. -Grilled octopus. It had a nice char grill flavor, judging by the red color, it was probably flavored with paprika. The texture of the octopus was great, not dry and very tender. On the negative side, the portion was tiny with only 3 pieces of tentacles on a small mount of potato salad. -Slushee was a nice concept, especially in this humid summer weather. It was also very pricey at $9 for a small glass. I had a sip of my husbands quince flavored slushee and it was a little too sweet for my taste. Service was mediocre with the staff still trying to find ways to accommodate high volume of patrons. Our water glasses were left empty a couple of times and the cured meat plate took a long time to arrive, although the rest of the food did arrive in a timely fashion. I wish this place was bigger and more comfortable. I dont mind the noise, but there was very little space you can stand, and not feel like you are in everyones way. This probably contributed to the slow service too since its hard to get around the restaurant when people are crowding around the bar area., Service is really slow - perhaps because they just opened, but still...Drinks are way to expensive and way to small. Total rip off.The food itself is actually quite good. Portions are small (even for a Tapas Bar) and prices are high (even for Logan Circle). I dont think I would come back to this restaurant again., Food was great; service, not so much.Went on a Thursday @ 6:30pm. Party of 2 plus a stroller. They were very accommodating with the stroller. Restaurant was half empty when we got there and PACKED when we left. Service: Our waiter was training a new shadow waitress, so everything took twice as long as it should. When we ordered food, I could see the waiter showing the newbie how to use the computer so it took a while for our order to reach the kitchen. We ordered a bottle of wine and the wine was not at our table so we depended upon the waiter to pour each glass. Unfortunately, he and his shadow were nowhere to be found most of the time. I asked another waiter to pour some wine and he, apparently, was unable to do so. He had to find OUR waiter to do it. this took a while and I was pretty close to doing it myself, but would have had to move the stroller and risk waking the baby. People should know by now that the BEST way to keep people happy is to keep the drinks coming. As for food, we enjoyed everything we ordered. People complain that it pricey, but the prices are fully disclosed on the menu so there are no surprises. And our waiter even informed us if what we ordered was too small and suggested that we order 2 (which we did).This is a relatively new place. I am hopeful that service will improve. We will visit sometime in the near future in order to find out., After fruitlessly waiting to be seated for almost ninety minutes on a visit at the end of July, we were able to secure a table with no wait at all . . . at 10:30 on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend, when D.C. is a ghost town.The food was excellent, in particular the croquetas, tuna bocadillo, serrano ham, and grilled squid. (Im not as much a fan of the ham-wrapped figs as others.) But, given the dishes simplicity and small size (except for the generous portion of squid), the prices felt a little high.The beer-and-lemon-soda porron was refreshing, and not at all embarrassing after the first few attempts to drink it properly!, Went to Estadio last night with a party of 6, we made reservations and our table was waiting, it was a slow night as it was the Tuesday after Labor day but the restaurant was full when we left. A couple of things are keeping me from giving this five stars. It was pricey, I knew that before I went but to fill up here and drink youll spend about $60 per person, but if they dropped some of the prices a little it would be a much better value. Our waiter was OK, he got better when I asked him to explain how it works, how many dishes we should each get etc. It was a little dark and I felt he could have done a better job of guiding us through the menu, maybe pointing out some highlights or personal favorites. The drinks, I got red wine, which was good and fairly priced, but 3 people got the red sangria and one the white. Both were vile. The red sangria tasted like syrup. I lived in Spain and know how to make authentic Sangria, this was gross. The white sangria was foul as well; it had a weird Anise Flavor.On to the food, we shared everything and got to sample a lot. I will say the food was excellent, unless otherwise noted. We tried the mushrooms, grilled scallion, tortilla Espanola (a bit too salty but good), cured meat sampler, manchango cheese, olives, mussels, duck, spiced chicken (a surprise how good it was), they were out of grilled octopus but we got the Rhode Island Calamari, outstanding, garlic shrimp, beet salad, green bean salad, a bocadilla of blood sausage, scallops, hanger steak, croquettas de jamon, veal shortbread (only thing I didnt like)and 3 desserts. The best dessert was the Cr38me Catalan. I would go back, and with a lot of people who like to share, it was a fun meal and a great birthday dinner for me, if they can fix the drinks itll be excellent and Ill move it to five stars. I loved the Surfer Rosa poster in the Mens room., I was impressed with the food, it 5-star worthy for that. Loved the decor, very spanish indeed. I walked in on a monday night and was able to get a table for two, we were seated at the bench style table facing the chefs. It was awesome but also a little too warm. I ordered a club soda, to my dismay was flat it didnt taste like a club soda more like a mineral sparkling water. I also ordered a glass of wine, they served in a tumbler style glass with very little wine in it.Now the food:Little bites on sticks.The chorizo with manchego cheese - such a good combination!!The procciutto wrapped around a fresh fig and almond - a must-try!Tortilla Espanola - it a fritata with slices of potatoes inside and topped with sliced sweet peppers. I ordered it because I saw the chef made it in front of me. It didnt taste as good as it looked.Rapini - the rapini was so tasty, I loved that they have real greens, yes real people should eat real vegetables!! It was cooked with garlic and pepper flakes nicely charred for a caramelized flavor.Patata - roasted cut up little potatoes with a sweet pepper sauce. Potoatoes cooked really well such a simple thing but made it right! Policy that charged $6 for burger fries should be embarassed for the lack of satisfaction in a lousy tapas.Octopus - I wanted to believe that Greek place on K St could make fresh octopus tasty but this really proved that they couldn. The octopus was so tender it was so good, served with raw fingerling potato slices. It was cooked perfectly like an octopus should be cooked. Very tasty!Veal Sweetbread - Nice coating on the sweetbread, it was fried and was super crunchy on the outside, served with thick crispy pancetta, baby kailan, grape tomatoes and balsamic sauce it was so A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Duck breast with Swiss Chard - ok, if you ever wanted to know how duck breast should taste like, go to Estadio. It was cooked perfectly medium yet the duck had such firmness it was unreal how good it was. It really put that French restaurant at Hotel Sofitel to shame.I would like to try more dishes there next time especially the hangar steak. The quality surpassed the pricing, Policy had the same pricing but the quality was so average it would leave you feeling you overspent for mediocre food. Estadio on the other hand, was priced fairly for the high quality of food. Overall, it was a very satisfying meal everything was cooked well and it had a nice ambience!, Chose Estadio as a runner up after Churchkey was closed for a private party. I started with a strawberry slushtio and it was yum yumm yummy. A friend and I shared jamon croquettas and mushroom croquettas and they were divine. Also had a divine toast with whipped goat cheese, heirloom tomatoes, and some tasty olive oil drizzle. We also had some mini-skewers that were super good. Everything was incredible.We sat at the bar and found the service to be excellent. Very friendly and helpful and happy to make suggestions.Will definitely go back., So far Ive loved all of the food that Ive tried here. Between two visits weve had each of the skewers, two of the open faced sandwiches, the patatas bravas, the chocolate cake and the peach cake. The stars were the patatas and the chocolate cake - both of which are items I wouldnt give a second thought at other restaurants because theyre generally so boring. Honestly, neither dish had any right to be as delicious as it was.I know that they tried to use the slushees to draw people in, but all of the drinks are pretty fantastic. Im especially a fan of the gin and tonic. I was skeptical when they described how they house infuse their own tonic - because honestly how special can tonic be. But its kind of amazing. Will go back for it many times, I LOVE this place and think it is a great addition to the neighborhood. I have eaten here three times already, and I cant wait to go back. Having traveled throughout Spain, I think the food and wine are very authentic. I particularly enjoy the garlic shrimp and grilled bread selections, and the gazpacho is among the best Ive ever had. Ive enjoyed almost all of the wines Ive tried, and the slushitos are very fun cocktails (the bartenders are very gracious about giving you just a taste if you are unsure whether you want to commit to buying one). Ask for a seat at the bar of the open kitchen -- it is fun to watch the chefs prepare the food. Every time Ive been the place has been bustling with people, so be prepared to grab a drink or two at the bar before being sat., My co-workers and I took some out-of-town clients to Estadio and boy, did this restaurant deliver. I studied abroad in Barcelona and now definitely jump at the chance to have tapas when I can. Unlike Jaleo or La Tasca (both of which I enjoy for different reasons), Estadio gives off the vibe of an intimate, rustic, authentic tapas bar. I really enjoyed the bar in the center where you can see them prep the pintxos and have a lot of the choices laid out in front of you.My party and I tried a variety of things on the menu -- all the cured meats, every cheese, a few bottles of wine and quite a few tapas. My specific requests were for the calamares a la plancha (grilled squid), stuffed squash blossoms and patatas bravas. The squid was perfectly cooked (aka not chewy) and I used leftover bread to soak up the garlicky olive oil. The squash blossoms were nothing to write home about--pretty standard, crispy, deep fried goodness. Now the patatas bravas--I baseline all my American tapas experiences by the restaurants patatas bravas and Estadio exceeded my expectations. The potatoes were crispy on the outside, but had a buttery texture on the inside. Unlike some places where the sauce either overpowers the potato or makes them soggy, the spicy tomato/garlic mayo/aioli sauce on these patatas gave just the right amount of kick and moisture. Other hits at the table were the wild mushroom croquettas, scallions with romesco sauce and anything with heirloom tomatoes. Although a little on the pricey side, I would definitely return to Estadio when I find myself craving Spanish food. I havent been for happy hour, but Id love to try it out since the wines we drank that night (a few of the reds) were tasty and I was ecstatic that Estadio sold my favorite Spanish beer, Estrella Damm (drinking on Las Ramblas anyone?). A couple glasses of wine, a beer and a few tasty, authentic tapas at this restaurant are definitely in the foreseeable future., We had a wonderful dinner here! I made reservations for 6PM because every time I have walked by the place has been packed...and because it was one of the only time slots available on Open Table. The decor is dark and cozy, with a heavy wood theme.We tried a number of recommendations from our server including:The Chorizo, Manchego & Pistachio Crusted Quince ($1.50) - It just a big bite, but an Oh, so Flavorful! one. The pricing is just right at $1.50 a skewer.The Country Bread with Whipped Goat Cheese, Tomato and Salsa Verde ($6) - It was a little hard to cut with a knife and fork but the tastiness of the dish made up for it!The Croquetas de Jamon with Picked Cucumbers ($6) - one of my favorite dishes of the night, the cheese was gooey and delicious and the cucumbers complimented wonderfully. Has anyone else noticed that the dish is displayed like a carrot? Too cute.The Scallops with Roasted Cauliflower & Salbitxada ($14) - Scallops were perfectly cooked, smooth flavoring. Crispy Veal Sweetbread, Filet Beans, Tomatoes, Bacon ($13) - One of the best Sweetbread dishes Ie had. Ever. Soooo good, if I wasn full by this time, I would have placed another order. Duck Breast, Baby Chard, Quince & Ginger Sauce ($13) - Very good, and we both enjoyed it BUT if you do not like salty foods, do not order this dish.Laurel Panna Cotta, Strawberry Gazpacho, Plovoron ($8) SOOO Glad we saved a {little} room for desert. This was the perfect finish to our meal. We had a tough time deciding from the other options as they also sounded delicious: Chocolate and Hazlenut Cake, Currant Bread Pudding, Warm Pear Cake, Fig Tart...The food came out in order, so we had time to eat one or two dishes before the next came out. I really appreciated that.Our total bill for two was a little over $100 - including the 4 mixed drinks we ordered, so the pricing is very reasonable for the quality and care that went into the food. I will definitely be back, as I excited to try the rest of the menu. Everything looks delicious!, I celebrated my birthday last night at Estadio. We had a reservation, but our table wasnt ready for an hour because of a lingering party before us. However, the WONDERFUL staff at Estadio went above and beyond. They brought us delicious drinks and appetizers on the house while we waited, and then the minute we sat down, brought even more food to make up for the long wait. The food, drinks and service was fantastic and made for a very special b-day celebration. Every dish we had was awesome - I cant wait to go back., Not a friendly restaurant. The hostess refused to seat us (a couple) in a window seat because those were only for groups of four. This was at 5pm, and we were the only people in the restaurant, so we left., We went here on a friday night for a celebratory dinner (I got a new job!) and the place was packed. They sat us at this counter in the back where you can watch the chefs prepare the food- it was like a japanese hibachi restaurant. but i really enjoyed it because we got to ask the chef questions about how they prepared everything. Food was delicious- we tried the duck (which was my favorite), the halibut and the hanger steak- as well as a grilled bread dish with goat cheese and tomatoes on it. i also really enjoyed their slushitos- its basically a slurpee with alcohol in it. Genius!, I thought the food here was good, but the service sucked. And the hostess should definitely find a different job. Their reservation policy sucks. I have no idea how they will continue to be a popular restaurant with their reservation policy. We were a group of 4 and could not make reservations and then were literally kicked out of our table because a reservation of 12 came in at 8. Drinks are good but very small and overpriced. Again, my biggest problem was with the staff itself, not the food., Had drinks and food at the bar. Bartender was friendly and very knowledgeable about the wine list - good thing for me because I didt know much about Spanish wines. Food was good and we will be back for dinner. Very nice atmosphere and service., A fabulous addition to the DC dining scene. I have been three times, once with my boyfriend, once for a Vegetarians birthday party, and once with a group of 6 young Moms who gather monthly for a night out. I love this restaurant because it makes you feel like you are far away from DC. The decor, the food, the cocktails are all a breath of fresh air. The service has always been impeccable, and the wait not long at all as I get there on the early side. Dishes to try include the sweetbreads, wild mushrooms, pincios (bite sized morsels of delish olives, artichokes, ham, etc.) and the duck. But, really, you cannot go wrong with any of the dishes from what I have sampled. The wines are awesome as well!, NOIts not good or friendly or stylish. Its cramped and unfriendly with tiny overpriced portions. The drinks are the best part when they arrive and theyre overpriced as well., OVERRATED. OVERPRICED..... saltiest shrimp we have ever had. seriously thought the object of it was too make us drink more...we spent $90 for a few drinks and appetizers. The best part was the tomato salad. I dont want to throw too much salt on their game. The atmosphere is seriously almost a 10, of you dont mind watching loops of south american football games from the 70s which I dont. I walk by here a few times a day, but have only been once and prob will not repeat. Long-time neighborhood resident. We heard the slushitos were the main draw. But seriously, the drinks are served in those little 8oz juice glasses for $9 a pop. REALLY!?!? My gf had one and I had tempranillo in the same whack glass.I dont mean to throw salt on their game, but the food was the SALTIEST I have ever had. I walked away with the impression the function of that was to drive drink sales. I really wanted like this place, as this restaurant is literally under my condo, but left really disappointed., OVERPRICED!You may notice that overpriced appears in at least 50% of the reviews on here. That because overpriced is the general impression that Estadio hits over your head. Sure, some dishes are delish. And sure, the atmosphere is hip yet cozy. And sure, you can have a lovely time here enjoying some unique cocktails with some awesome flavor combinations.But paying for a VERY frugal 4.5 oz pour of wine what that bottle costs in a store? That a bit much.It sad really. I would LOVE to recommend this restaurant. But the wine pricing is particularly obnoxious - although there are some reasonable wines by the bottle. I hope enough people will communicate their dissatisfaction with the pricing that the owners will be forced to turn this into the decent restaurant it can be. But until that day, there a reason almost every review includes the word overpriced. Do you want me to say overpriced a few more times, or do you get the idea?, went here for dinner the other night. the food was really good and pretty big sized portions (larger than most tapas places). the service was great and our waitress was very friendly. everything she recommended was really good. i loved the chicken and the pea shoots. the chocolate cake was also amazing . i didnt think it was overpriced at all.overall a fun new place i would definitely go back to!!, I actually give Estadio 3.5 stars but decided it leaned toward the 3 side of things when I had to chose. Pros: - Excellent service- I love sharing at dinners and this is a great place for that, we probably ordered at least 10 things and I got to try them all and was stuffed by the end.- Scallops were delicious, as were the goat cheese montadito and the mushrooms both in croquette and roasted form.Cons:- Very loud, our group of 9 was seated at a long, high top table right by the bar and it was difficult to even hear our server, much less each other. Its possible they dont have another table large enough to accommodate that number but it was not a very good place for a group. Id come back here but with max 4 people. - The skewered bites were just a bit too large (for me, anyway), to eat in one bite but awkward to eat in two. I personally really didnt like to artichoke and anchovy one, the fish was just draped across the top, making it even harder to eat.Overall, I enjoyed my meal and would go back but am not sure Id add it to my list of favorites, there was nothing really special or exceptional about it for me., I had an amazing meal at Estadio. The decor was impressive but the real draw is the food. My husband and I showed up at 6:15pm on a Saturday and waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before being seated. We shared glasses of Tempranillo and the Tecolate (Tequila & Cava, Rosemary & Grapefruit - super tasty!!) while we waited. Once seated we ordered way too much food, but everything was incredible - house marinated olives; cabrales cheese (the most amazing cabrales Ive had, and ive had lots); chorizo; pinxtos of anchovy, olive and peppers (a big skewered bite, very tasty); jamon, serrano and manchego open-face sandwich (my husband loved it, not my favorite); bonito bocadillo (amazing); squid (super tender); and wild mushrooms (we tasted but took them home since we were too full). The service was great. Bartender and waiter were friendly. Waiter made several recommendations and was always there when we need something. Every time we emptied a plate someone cleared it pretty much immediately. Im a huge fan of Spanish food and traveled to Basque country last year, so of course Im an expert. I was impressed by Estadio and would return in a heartbeat. My husband also really enjoyed it. Its not cheap but all the food plus the drinks (we also split the gin & housemade tonic - excellent) - were priced comparably to many other local restaurants.My only complaint was that there is a single restroom (a must-see) for women. The line was always long and it was very annoying., I like the space and the location. I didnt find it as incredibly awesome as some did. I wasnt crazy about the table we got as it was crammed between the bar and the bathroom. The server we had was really good - patient and offered great suggestions. Did get a bit rushed toward the end of the meal, however. We werent lingering overlong, but we felt like we were being prompted to move along the moment we finished eating. Its ok, food was good, but its still working out the logistics of service, seating, etc., I think. Ill return, but for the money Id expect just a bit more in terms of the whole experience., When Churchkey randomly closed their doors when I had a birthday party scheduled there for 15 people last month, Estadio stepped up to the challenge to help us out. In the end, I think it was meant to be because the drinks were creative, the food was delicious, and the staff was friendly and helpful. Highly recommended!, My first thoughts when I heard about Estadio opening in the neighborhood were, Oh crap. Another Tapas place. That the last thing the neighborhood needs. Just once, I want my own meal on my own plate. Now I have been to Estadio 5 times and I am a fan. What sets Estadio apart from some of the other Tapas places in town? The decor is fantastic. Everything from the concrete bar (how did they do that?) to the Spanish motif throughout the restaurant makes it a comfortable place to eat. I love sitting at the back counter around the spotlessly clean kitchen where I can watch the cooks whip together the tasty small plates. The service is very friendly, helpful and enthusiastic while not being overbearing. The servers are knowledgeable about everything on the menu including the fine wine and drink list. The food is really good. The heirloom tomato salad that I loved was just replaced with a Butternut Squash soup for the Fall and Winter which is great. The chicken dish has a sweet curry flavor that even one that doesn normally love Indian food will rave about. The salamis and cheeses are very good (but the portion size for the cheese is far too small for the price). The drinks are fun - one option that you may miss on the menu is the homemade gin and tonic made with tonic water and quinine that they make fresh every day. It is made with two over-sized ice cubes and is sweeter than a normal gin and tonic, but is very very good. I would avoid the slushy drinks that they say are their specialty drinks. They are tiny and expensive and only reasonably good. A hint: It gets very crowded here and they only take reservations for groups of 6 or more. Head to Estadio between 5 and 6 pm and you will get more attentive service without a wait. Make sure you tell them not to bring out everything you order at once - they are good about spreading it out over a bit of time if you ask them too. If the cheese portions were a bit bigger or cheaper and if their drinks were also a bit bigger, I would easily give Estadio 5 stars. Welcome to the neighborhood, Estadio., Admittedly great food, but way overpriced. I cant believe what passed for a glass of wine here - they were at least half the size of regular glasses, and the bottles of wine - slightly less expensive - were lower-quality than what they served in glasses. I couldnt stop munching on the spiced almonds, but the next time I feel like splurging on a cheese plate, Im heading to Bistro Lepic in Georgetown, where the staff are at least as friendly and the vibe, though still way too bougey for me, is significantly less cloyingly hip. Honestly, I love me some kale, but $8 for less than a handful of the greatest poor-mans food on earth? And, there was sand in our scallops. Tsk tsk, Estadio, you should know better than that., After visiting here, Im a converted tapas fan.At other restaurants, the tapas portions are really small and Ive had to wait a long time between getting my orders. Not at Estadio, they kept the food coming. They were good sized, shareable portions and the flavors were wonderful.My one complaint, they charged us for more bread, which is petty. Its like the airlines charging for baggage, blankets and earplugs. Other than this one hiccup, our group had a wonderful evening., Tried this a few days ago after hearing the hype. Used to live around the corner, so was quite curious. They dont take reservations after 6:00 PM and Im past the stage of waiting for more than an hour for a table, so we went ahead and booked a table on OpenTable at 6:00 PM. Even then it was packed, albeit with a non-negligible share of 60 and over crowd.The space is nice and large -- I like the communal high tables. Our waiter was initially a bit pushy (asked what I would like to order within a minute of sitting down while I was still waiting for the other three dinner mates... He eventually mellowed down and actually made some good recommendations to my friends. I dont drink cocktails, but my friends enjoyed the gin and tonic and the tecolate (tequila and cava with grapefruit).The tapas were excellent -- cant remember a single dish that really missed. The boquerones (anchovies) are everywhere on the menu a worth a shot. I tried the marriage one (an open sandwich with peppers) and it was great -- can share it with someone else. Pintxos, the bite sized dishes were also fine, but not a lot of choice.You have to order the shishito peppers. When they first come out of the grill, they are fantastic. The waited described them as Russian roulette and that is roughly right. Like jalapenos, some are super hot while others quite mild -- but all delicious. Scallions with a romesco sauce and sheeps milk cheese are also good. We also had a cheese plate and the endive and beets salad: both excellent with the bread for the cheese replenished multiple times as necessary.All fish dishes we ordered were right on. The halibut was particularly well cooked. Squid a la plancha, which I normally find to be chewy, was also well-seasoned and cooked. One friend, a Taiwanese-American, ordered the pea shoots wondering if they were Asian and was pleasantly surprised. he and his wife also loved the duck breast.If I had to nitpick, Id say that I did not love drinking wine out of small liquor glasses (looked like I was having a scotch neat), but the wine list is very nice. I stuck with the Albarino at the start, followed by a nice Tempranillo.For desert, I had the lighter than air bread pudding - the best I had in my life. Bread pudding is always a gamble, which paid off enormously this time and was a perfect ending to the dinner with a half a glass of port that I shared with Sarah.The noise level was also perfectly manageable even though by the time we were leaving around 8:45 PM, the place was packed (double rows around the large bar area). Im definitely going back and trying some other things on the menu as well as reordering at least the shishito peppers, the halibut, and the marriage boqueron. Highly recommended -- although at $70 per person, this place is not exactly cheap., Ive tended to oppose tapas, as they usually feel like a huge rip-off. But Estadio has me singing a new tune! For $40, my husband and I left pleasantly satisfied (not overstuffed, but full). More importantly, each bite was a delight! The butternut squash soup was quite possibly the best soup Ive ever eaten in my life. Other favorites: tortilla, patatas bravas, and chorizo sandwich. It wont disappoint!, Good portion sizes and quality tapas. Yummy if small cocktails. Service can be lacking. Try some of my faves.... the tortilla espanola, boquerones, deviled eggs, hangar steak, beet salad, green bean salad, and red cachaca sangria!, After giving into all the hype, we took my boyfriends parents here for dinner tonight. We were able to get a 6PM reservation through OpenTable.I was impressed by the ornate decor; from the tables to the chairs to the lamps. We were seated in the front of the restaurant along the huge window. Our server was friendly and helpful. I suggest ordering a bottle of wine to share, to get more bang for your buck. Wine by the glass is overpriced by at least a couple of dollars.We started off with a cheese plate and a sampler of the cured meats. Then came the spinach and beet salads, which were fresh and colorful. We also ordered the mussels, grilled octopus, hanger steak, pea shoots, mushrooms and the grilled bread with fresh tomato (similar to a bruschetta). The portions were perfect to share. The food was delicious; however, I felt the hanger steak was too salty.Overall, we had a great experience., What a fun night! One of my girlfriends was in town for the weekend so we wanted a nice, fun place to eat. Estadio is around the corner, and Id never been, so we dressed up and headed over there. We got there at 8 PM (it was a Friday) and were told it was an hour to an hour and a half wait. I was prepared for that, but my stomach wasnt (we had played tourists all day). After some debate we decided we were too hungry to wait so we headed out. The tall gentleman in a Yankees hat by the host stand followed us out. He asked us why we didnt want to wait. I said this was my first choice because my friend was visiting and Ive always wanted to eat here, but we were just too hungry. He said that we could wait at the bar, and I referenced the Yelp reviews I had read that said the bar gets pretty crowded. Then he revealed his name was Mark, the owner, and he invited us back in, convincing us to wait. We had a drink at the surprisingly not-so-crowded bar (the white sangria was amazing!) and were seated 10 minutes later at the bar around the kitchen (perfect for an aspiring cook like me!). While I know that experience is a little unusual, let me tell you--I would have waited an hour and a half for the food. We had the shrimp, the tortilla Espanola (so good!), the zucchini and the ham and cheese flatbread. We finished dinner with a few more rounds and some chocolate cake. The portions were all very good sized for tapas, and we left feeling very full. The service was great and the staff was very friendly. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didnt think it was overpriced at all, especially for DC. Without drinks, our food total was around $40, so $20 per person for dinner is not bad at all in this town. Id go back in a hearbeat, prepared for a wait. So thanks, Mark and the Estadio team, for helping me show my friend what great food DC has! Your consideration for your customers and your passion for your restaurant was very apparent to us, and it made our experience all the more enjoyable., Unlike most tapas place which tend to be small and dark, Estadio is spacious, well-lit (but not glaring) with high ceiling, and the plates are unusually big for tapas. We went in with no expectations and knew nothing about it. But eventually my attention was drawn to the dishes as they started coming out. The Jamon wrapped figs were a nice balance of salty and sweet, not too much of each; grilled octopus had the perfect char-grilled flavor and still retain the bounciness of the octopus; saut39ed pea shoots were sweet and tender and not too greasy; and I must recommend the spiced grilled chicken and duck breast with quince and ginger sauce! Both were juicy, tender, and full of flavor! I would go back just for these 2 dishes.The wine list has a good variety and our waitress was helpful in recommending wine from her own experience, and not from what she read. I think I actually like Estadio better than Cork which is only couple blocks away!, Very very nice place! Food was amazingly good, service was fast and friendly, price was decent. What else can I ask? Meat tapas dish was awesome, big enough for a tableOf four to start. Butternut squash soup was really good but tad hot when it arrived. Cheeze was really good and so the hard bread that came with it. Highly recommended., Had a pretty awful brunch this morning at Estadio. The mediocre food was surpassed only mildly by the indifferent service. Two of us ordered the egg tortilla, expecting a traditional Spanish tortilla (heavy egg and potato dish) and the other two ordered hanger steak and eggs. The tortillas came a full 15 minutes before the hanger steaks. I finished mine before the steaks came. The tortillas were not the hearty dish we expected, but rather a very fluffy, small, light quiche-ish thing. It wasn bad, but it wasn at all filling. This place is supposed to be Basque/Spanish. No Basque person would call this a tortilla. When the steaks finally arrived they were room temperature. We complained to the waiter who, while nice, never apologized. He just agreed that the tortilla was weird. And he noted that since brunch is new, theye kind of figuring it out. The manager was right next to our table while we were complaining about how long the steaks were taking, and did nothing. The interior is very nice, so I will begrudgingly give one star for that.In short, not the greatest food, rather pricey considering portion sizes (at least for the tortilla, which was $9), flaky/unconcerned service, and a cool looking joint. I hear it OK for drinks but I would not come back for brunch., Loved it. I really enjoyed the Moscatel Sherry Float, wow!, I had high hopes for Estadio before walking in the door. After all, the owner has another very sucessful restaurant in the area. While the dining room is esthetically pleasing, the service and food is lacking. The service was quite haphazard. It seemed our waiter could care less if we were there or not. While talking to us he kept looking at other tables. He failed to explain the menu and was completely disinterested in his job. It was one of the poorest service Ive experienced and I made that known in the tip and to the hostess desk. The food was ok. There wasnt anything I tasted that was screaming I want more. Overall, it was a disappointing experience., Awesome. Great cheeses and sisho peppers. This place is hopping and fun and not too expensive. One of the best places in DC, I like the space, it warm and earthy. We order at least one from each section and I must say I like that it not greasy like the other places I have been too. The ingredients are fresh and its not too heavy. Good favors. My favorite was: Chorizo, Manchego & Pistachio Crusted Quince skrewer and Hanger Steak, Tomato & Bread Salad & Mojo Verde., Well I wont repeat everything the boyfriend said - but a few additions to his review: The olives - I am an olive eater and honestly these were great! Cheese selection - my favorite was the Mahon Reserve - I agree with the La Serena being the least favorite; not because it wasnt tasty, but because it was a little too creamy for what I was wanting. Charcuterie board - Get it! I agree that the chorizo was the best, but the serrano ham ran a very close second. Grilled octopus - So this is my first every try of grilled octopus; Ive had it sauteed before (baby) and Ive had it with sushi - neither of which I particularly cared for. This however was very tasty. I liked the grilled smokey flavor and although I wasnt sure what kind of texture I should get - I know it wasnt rubbery like overcooked squid can sometimes taste. Bacalao - I love bacalao; I spent 2 years in Portugal and it is pretty much at every meal in every way imaginable. It is one of my all time favorites. The use of the jalapenos gave a nice spice that was offset by the creaminess of the avocado and the acid from the citrus. A very satisfying dish and one I could eat again and again. Sweetbreads - This would be the second time I have ever had sweetbreads. My first bite was completely of salt taste which is a shame. I did have a piece with none of the breading and it had a nice flavor without the saltiness. Of all the dishes this was my least favorite because of how salty it was. The rest of my boyfriends review is spit on; especially the critique on the kale, persimmon tart and the wine glass. All in all I would go again here, I thought the service was excellent and the food overall very tasty., Come here for the charm. It feels straight out of Spain. There are some simply stunning dishes here and some meh dishes, but overall, this is a great dining experience. Go for the tortilla, peppers, red kale, and any cheese. The shrimp were also good and any of the sandwiches.Their house tonic is great. I was also a big fan of the Tourist sangria, which included rosemary and apple.And if you know what good for you, go for the pear dessert. It is amazing. The pumpkin panna cotta was a bit dry, and the persimmon tart wasn totally executed well (i.e., it hard to cut the persimmon on top).I say the prices are a bit high, but youl definitely leave feeling satisfied., It really upset me to see that this restaurant had fallen below four stars. Estadio has become my favorite DC spot lately: great food, interesting drink menu, and a lovely space. Ie ordered a range of things on the menu and have generally found myself at various points along the pleased to wowed spectrum. Highlights for me have included the well-rounded cheese selection, salty and addictive pea shoots, garlicky and spicy rapini (which was subbed for kale on a subsequent trip), Marriage Boqueron (to die for, really), and the hanger steak (very solid). As for a healthy dose of criticism, I had the duck breast on my first visit. It was just so-so and lacked the crispy, crackling skin that every good duck breast ought to have.Overall, the food is sophisticated, clean, and flavorful. I would give 4 1/2 stars if I could.
22|filomena-ristorante-washington|I agree with Heather L. The food here is not as glorious as one would expect given that you regularly see the women in the window making fresh pasta. Only I don think that all the pasta dishes on here are actually fresh. I have been here several times and several times have been wishing that I had gone somewhere else. The decor is decent, the service is friendly, and apparently people enjoy the desserts and the idea of eating fresh pasta. I not one of them. I personally did not enjoy my dessert AT ALL and my pasta could only be described as decent, but then decent isn really what inspires one to visit again and again., I have been to Filomenas four or five times and have never been disappointed. Expect a packed house every time you go. The lunch buffet is decent, but I would recommend going there for dinner. The homemade mushroom ravioli and Anelli alla Napoletana are my personal favorite pasta dishes and you cant beat their desserts, especially the tiramisu. If you get the chance to go there around Christmas or Easter, the decorations are worth the price of admission., Outside of Little Italy in NY, Italy itself, and my Grandmother kitchen, Ie never had better Italian food. This place is excellent. They have a great menu and everything was spectacular. The decor of the restaurant is sort of old school but it compliments the dark atmosphere of the restaurant very well. They also have a great bar and their wait staff is attentive and genuine. I think our waiter was actually Italian too (they get a 6th star just for that). After dinner and a decadent dessert, he brought us these massive carafes of amaretto and sambuca. They were gigantic and he said it was on the house. I was happy, but kind of disturbed at the same time. What in the name of God am I going to do with a gallon of Amaretto and Sambuca? Do I have a sticker on my back that says alcoholism is my most favorite disease or something?, I recently tripped down into Filomenas merry subterranean depths for the $13.95 all-you-can-eat Sunday Brunch. I think that the best way to describe the restaurant would be, perhaps, cheerfully insane. Theyre all ready for Easter, you see, so glassy-eyed bunnies are everywhere, peeping at you in silent horror, from behind shimmering purple curtains, from between flowers and vines. The flowerpots wear lacy garters. The food, well, it was filling and mostly edible. Their pizza was bready and cheesy. The pasta was squishy and overcooked. The special egg dish was Eggs Estrada, consisting of eggs, tomatoes, cheese, broccoli and mushrooms (essentially, everything that had already been chopped up for the salad bar, plus eggs). The lamb was very lamby. Like, really lamby. I didnt try the turkey because it was covered in a very pale, disturbing sauce, like candlewax. The potatoes were tasty and the bacon was crispy and greasy (yum).So, whatever. The desserts were nice. There was a chocolate-coconut cake which was tasty if you ate around the coconut. There was an odd banana-bitter chocolate mousse cake, which was delicious if you ate around the banana. There was also a dulce de leche mousse cake which was just plain delicious although by then I was so full of potatoes and Eggs Erik Estrada that I couldnt finish it. Anyway, in summary, good for $13.95 all-you-can-eat, not so good for anything else. Including romantic dinners. Its hard to have a conversation while the bunnies are watching you., I just have to start out by saying how adorable the women in the window making pasta are.....I have now visited Filomena on two occasions, and have been quite pleased both times. My second visit was just following Easter, and was a bit frightened by the overwhelming amount of Easter decorations they put up. The food is tasty and very filling. I have tasted a variety of their pasta dishes and had an amazing veal scallopini dish. Every pasta is full of flavor, rich and traditional. The desserts are quite a delight as well. While waiting to be seated you can study the various cheesecakes, tiramisu and other massive cakes they have out on display. Personally the cookies and cream cheesecake has been my fave, but we tasted the cheesecake with fruit on the top and that was quite good as well. If dining at Filomena plan to be thoroughly satisfied and extremely full....you will probably leave with a doggy bag...., This old-school Italian place in Georgetown offers ENORMOUS potions of good food at good prices with fabulous service and a nice cushy atmosphere in its basement location. This is definitely a place to bring grandma. The homemade pastas are made by one of the pasta Mammas that work in a little room at street level next to the entrance cranking out pasta, agnolotti and ravioli all day long. The stuffed mushrooms are good as a starter but VERY rich- no shortge of cheese, olive oil and butter in that dish. I highly recommend the lasagna, the canneloni and any ravioli. The salads are good and with the size of the entrees I recommend each getting a salad and sharing an entree if you have any hope of partaking in dessert. The desserts are displayed right near the hostess stand so while you are waiting when you arrive you can start to plan for dessert. The cakes and cheesecakes are delicious and the slices HUGE (plan on sharing (ok to even share 4 ways!) or bringing half home with you). The wines are mostly Italian and not cheap. After dinner they will bring you a bottle of Sambuca to the table to have a shot before dessert. woo hoo!, My boyfriend and I were in DC over the weekend, and we were looking for a nice meal to celebrate our anniversary. What we got, however, was some of the worst service weve ever had, and the mediocre food certainly didnt make up for it. I shouldve known when we walked in and found out that theyd screwed up our reservation that it was going to be a long night. The waiter was incredibly rude and inattentive. He failed to notice not once, but twice that we had no silverware. (The first time, we pilfered some from another table so we could eat our appetizers. They, of course, cleared them with the rest of the appetizer plates, and I had to ask for one when my dinner came.) My water glass was empty throughout most of my meal, despite asking for a re-fill, and our plates sat in front of us for at least 15 minutes after wed finished eating. When we tried to order dessert, he walked away before we were done ordering, and I had to call him back.And the food - eh. I had the pollo alla dorothea, which was ok, but not great. My boyfriend had the vitello alla filomena and he said it was bland. Dessert was fine, though, as was our appetizer (arancini).The restaurant was incredibly loud, so dont go here if youd like to have a conversation. We got tired of yelling across the table at each other, and gave up. Oh, and because the restaurant was decorated for Halloween, it was a scary combination of grandmas living room and a serial killers basement. We were seated under a spinning, severed Chucky head. Somehow, it seemed appropriate for this experience., After some confusion over my dinner reservations at another establishment (that turned out to be rude and condescending on top of it), the BF and I ended up here for my birthday dinner. We were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed our experience.Yes, the place is kitchy and large, and decorated for Halloween, but the waitstaff was incredibly professional in every way. The BF even commented on the fact that someone had trained them in proper etiquette as they knew to take our plates away only when we had crossed our forks and knives on our plates. Our waiter was so sweet and friendly, answered all of our questions and kept our breadbasket full. Speaking of that breadbasket - it was full of warm, chewy bread that paired really well with the herbs and olive oil provided.We started out with the spinach stuffed mushroom caps in a creamy sauce. This was lovely. I could have actually done without the sauce all together because the spinach filling was so delicious. These caps were gone in about 42 seconds. For dinner, the BF ordered spinach ravioli and I had the seafood canneloni. Both were huge portions. My canneloni was very yummy and the lobster cream sauce was divine. Yes, I ate every last bite. I tasted the raviolis as well and dare I say that those were even tastier than my canneloni!When we were finished, imagine our surprise when our waiter brought us decanters of Amaretto and Sambuca. We were allowed to pour our own glass of after dinner apertif. Free of charge! That was a nice touch. There was also a plethora of fabulous looking cakes to be had for dessert, but after the load of cream sauces, neither of us could put another bite in our mouths.So, as the BF and I patted our full bellies, and slowly sipped our Sambuca with 3 coffee beans in it (one for health, one for wealth, and one for love) we decided that we really enjoyed our experience here. We also agreed that the place would be a real hit if it were some tiny hole in the wall restaurant instead of the cavernous place that it was.There were some downsides to Filomena, which is why I can give it 5 stars. First, the size and noise didn lend itself to a romantic dinner - felt rather more like a place that a tour bus would pull up outside of. Second, we felt the prices were a little on the high side. Third, and only thought about afterwards, there was no pasta on the menu. Like spaghetti or linguine or penne. There was only stuffed pastas and hardly any tomato sauces. That could be a displeasing thing for many folks who enjoy those types of Italian food.Overall, we really enjoyed our time here. The service was excellent and the food was really good. Plus, they get bonus points for accommodating us after the fallout from the other restaurant., i really love this restaurant. ive been a few times and have had the mozzarella di bufala and insalata di lattuga (lemon dressing with paramesan cheese). both were delicious. i have had the ravioli di funghi (mushroom) and the agnolotti alla panna (spinach), the salmon, and the spaghetti with shrimp and olives. they have all been wonderful. the bread and olive oil they give you to start out with is also really good and has a lot of variety. i have always had impeccable service and think its the best italian ive had in the city., Dont come here if you are looking for cannolis, but they do have some pretty delicious pastas and appetizers. I suggest family style otherwise you will be hurting. And save room for the complementary digestifs....trust me you will need it., Filomena sign is emblazoned in a sci-fi font. The interior is a mix of a conservative old-school Italian accentuated by dark woods, and a slightly festive jungle (!) look with flowers, Roman statues, and hanging plants throughout. There a view of the kitchen from the roughly 80-seat dining room. It wasn crowded, perhaps because (1) it was a wicked hot summer day, (2) the place isn on the main Georgetown drag, and (3) it was around 1pm.Our server (say VicTOR) was funny (ha-ha funny). Another server spilled a glass of water on me (oops!). Luckily the freakishly absurd summer heat helped dry me off when I left.Instead of paying $10-$12 for a single entree, we went for the lunch buffet ($13, though their site shows $18?) to try more of their cooking. The buffet quality wasn mind blowing nor disappointing. The salad was fresh and I enjoyed the homemade dressings (love it!). Didn try the soup (homemade) or bread (baked in-house). Couldn resist the thick-crusted pizza (baked in-house), which wasn bad. I had portions of their meat, chicken, and seafood concoctions, some which looked as appetizing as they tasted. All the pasta is homemade - one staffer even makes it upstairs by the entrance. Desserts are made in-house. Good-looking cakes; the chocolate cake was rich!I might return for dinner, but not for their buffet only because it a tad heavy and easy to fill up on pasta., I decided to take Keely here for our two year anniversary and I glad I did. The entrance to Filomena is a tad small and semi-hard to find if youe not familiar with the Georgetown area. Parking isn so bad if you head on over to the Georgetown Shops parking garage. The price is about normal.Walking into the restaurant, you can help but notice the ladies hand making pasta in the only room on the first floor. They were pretty nice and smiled when I said hello. The main restaurant area is fantastic. There is a coat check for those large winter coats. The bar area is the only thing that lacking here. It can only sit six people. Not too fun if youe waiting for your table and want to grab a drink or two beforehand. The main seating area was all decked out with Christmas decorations. I must say that it was tastefully done. There were white trees decorated with silver ornaments and hanging bronze reindeers that came down from the ceiling. The only problem I had with the main area was that the seats were a little close together. I had no problem overhearing every conversation around me. That was a bit of a bummer.I called ahead of time and ordered our food so we could enjoy being waited on and have everything taken care of. The food was great. Our appetizer and entrees were cooked to perfection. Moreover, we grabbed a bottle of their classic white and had a great time. I recommend their ravioli di michele. The service was great. I never was able to finish my glass of wine before they came and refilled it. They were on the spot with our food and we didn have to wait for our different courses.This is a great place to come for any occasion and I plan on returning., Craig brought me to Filomena for our anniversary celebration a few weekends ago. They would get an extra half-star (if it was allowed) for having Christmas decorations out the wazoo in the middle of November. I loooooove Christmas.Anyway, Craig really stepped it up this year in terms of anniversary plans, it definitely beat my Ben Folds show last year. He opted to choose our menu before we got there so we didnt have to worry about ordering drinks or dinner, which is a great option if you love food in general and are so hungry you want one of everything. Right off the bat our waiter (dressed in a penguin suit, classy) came out with our bottle of wine and filled our glasses, and brought a basket of bread to the table. Yum, carbs. Lots of them. Craig had decided on a chicken ravioli dish that I loved, and a delicious white chocolate macadamia mousse cake for dessert. I thought the food was great, the service speedy and fantastic, and the restaurant itself cozy and welcoming, even if it is a bit squished. Oh, complimentary amaretto and sambuca after dinner. Need I say more?, Worth the calories plus more! I judge Italian restaurants much harder than others and this was just great! The atmosphere is so warm and cozy. The tables were close together but it didnt feel like we were on top of each other. The server was so nice and offered to specially make anything on the menu because of my moms onion allergy. For appetizers we had Funghi all Fiorentina (Three Big White Mushroom Caps stuffed with a mix of sauted Spinach and Italian Cheeses. Served with our popular Bernini Sauce.) and a trio of Bruschetta (traditional, goat cheese and sauteed onions, and one with salmon and cream). For our entrees we had Cavatelli (One of Italys oldest handmade pastas ~ The Pasta Mammas handmade tender Ricotta Dumplings tossed in a light Sauce of Tomato, Fresh Sage and a touch of browned butter.) Pollo All Domenican(Double Breast of Chicken stuffed with Spinach, Mushrooms, Leeks, Sausage & Croutons. Rolled in our Homemade Bread Crumbs, sauted and topped with Creamy Italian Style Sauce.) If all of that wasnt enough we finished with an amazing dessert: Three luxurious layers of solid Mousse-Milk Chocolate, White Chocolate and Mocha Mousse (with no cake in between!) atop a fudgy base of flourless chocolate cake and piled high with chocolate shavings.Worth it for the buck? DEFINITELY. Worth it during restaurant week? If you can go to the gym a few extra times, Id eat here each day., Well, its not in Italy. However, the little Italian ladies in the window, hand-making the pasta is a clue that this place is special.I had the hand-made butternut squash gnocchi with a cream sauce, and it was to die for. I say this, and Ive driven through the small towns of Tuscany and had the spectacular food there.Its worth it to ask what pasta is made in-house. I recommend., I think my expectations of this restaurant were so high given its reputation and prices, that they couldnt really be met. Heres a run-down. The service was great. The ambience was cool, but loud (8 yr old girl birthday party, but thats an anomaly). The sambucco and amaretto afterward were quite a treat. On the flip side, the portions were gargantuan, the quality was above average but not stupendous, and the prices were high. If I do find myself making the trek to dine in Georgetown again for Italian, Ill be headed to Paparazzi across the street., Weekday lunch is no longer a bacchanalian feast at Filomena. This is both good and bad. Good for my backside, bad for my memories of Filomena.I leaving my job in Georgetown for a new position downtown, so I was asked by a work buddy where I wanted to have my farewell lunch. I thought long and hard, and had a carb-flashback to a past lunch at Filomena that involved many, many trips through the buffet line. Why not hurt myself again? Indeed, why not. So it was agreed, and we picked Fat Tuesday for the occasion.Filomena looks a lot like we remember, with the painting of a nearly naked lady, lots of heavy fabrics, and profusely decorated for the nearest upcoming holiday, which happened to be Valentine Day.Except, whoa, something missing. What is it, can quite put my finger on it, ...... it the huge ass buffet table with every pasta item known to man! Where the ridiculously large dessert table? Sigh. Turns out they only set up the buffet on Fridays and Saturdays.So we ordered from the menu, one paltry dish at a time. I say paltry, but my Penne con Salsicce was so large I wished I had brought my pick-axe and crampons. I barely made it halfway, and the rest will probably serve as two future lunches.How was the food? Not too bad. The appetizers were good - we got the stuffed mushrooms and the Arancini. The sauce on my penne dish was excellent, and the sausage quite tasty. The pasta was whole wheat, which I like, but too al-dente for me (still crunchy, not just toothy). We were really looking forward to the bread pudding, but turns out, they only make that for the absent buffet. I passed on the fancy desserts from the display case.The weirdest thing was, the place was totally empty. I mean, we were there from noon to 1, and we only saw two other parties being served. It seems that without the buffet, we weren alone in thinking that lunch at Filomena just isn the draw it used to be., While I was at Howard, my Honors Composition professor chartered a bus to transport his distinguished students across town for an end-of-semester lunch at this spot. I dont remember much, other than swooning over the most delicious tortellini Id ever tasted. (That and being oggled by the patrons and staff, who were doubtless wondering why the hell all these colored kids-- so curiously articulate-- were descending on them.)Said professor wore a bespoke suit everyday. He was his countrys first ambassador to the UN. He was in the Royal Airforce. He has a doctorate in physics from Cambridge. He wrote To Sir, With Love. In short, he dont go for no bullshit. Hence, five stars., I really enjoyed both of my visits to this restaurant, the most recent one being last October on a business trip. My husband and I split a delicious salad, and split a wonderful chicken ravioli dish. The portions are huge, so sharing is highly recommended. I believe they also have a dish named after Bono (I guess hes a fan), so they get points from me on that one too.I found the service on both visits to be excellent. Also, at the end of your meal they bring you a couple of free bottle of liqueur for you to sample. It was cold out on my last visit, so that warmed me right up.The head chef may have left, but I found the quality of the food on both of my visits, which were about two years apart, to be excellent., A great place to celebrate a special occasion - because whoa, its pricy. The wine selection is great, food highly yummy, the decor dark and not-quite-romantic (as in, it can be romantic, depending on who youre with), and who can beat free sambucca and amaretto at the conclusion of your meal?, Was there on 12.14.08 prior to a trip to the Kennedy. I hadnt been there since the 80s. Had reservations but still had to wait for a table. The place was mobbed at 4:30pm. We had 2 baked pasta dishes that I swear were microwaved and cold in the middle - we had to eat it as we were on a schedule. 1 martini and 2 pasta dishes and the tab was over 60 bucks. We were definitely treated like a number - I realize its Christmas time however this place has a MUCH better reputation and for the money I expect a LOT more - especially when parking is 15 bucks to boot. I will say one thing positive - the decor was AWESOME. They had to have a professional do their Christmas decorations - shame after beating my way through traffic from Annapolis to DC that our dining experience there was a total bust. Doubt Ill be back unless I can catch a helicopter ride into town..., Delicious!Wide variety of freshly made pasta, both filled and not. This is sort of what they are known for.Also have a good selection of meat, chicken and seafood stuff. Strong flavors, and HUGE portions. Good place to share an entree.A little overdone on decoration, particularly around the holidays, but really, who goes out to eat for the decoration?Pricey, so not a good place for a casual night out, but if youre looking to impress someone, or want to take your sig. other out for a nice meal, this is the place.Oh, and the amaretto and sambuca they give you at the end for free is a nice touch., We had lunch here the Saturday before Xmas and it was delicious as always. Seeing the dining room all dolled up for Xmas was part of the attraction for me. It looked like Santa threw up in there and I mean that in the best possible way. The tacky decorations for various holidays always crack me up.Now on to the food: 4 people, 4 entrees, 4 happy diners. All but one of us ordered pasta (the exception being my friends eggplant parm, which she raved about). My wife and I both ordered the agnolotti and while it was very good, it was also very rich. I cant remember what the other member of our party had, but I do remember him saying he really enjoyed it.Ill admit, this place isnt for everyone, but its always a must-visit spot for me when I make it to DC. Im not alone either. When I mention Filomenas to other friends who have passed through DC, they speak very fondly of the place, too. And for those who think dinner is a little too steep, go for lunch like we did. For an app, two glasses of wine and four entrees, we paid $75 before tip. Not bad! Just one more thing though: I recommend going around a major holiday to get a side of kitsch with the well-made pasta dishes. It just makes the meal that much better., PASTA MAMAS!Great italian food, decent price, excellent ambiance and HUGE portions.A Georgetown favorite of mine!, Imagine this. Gnocchi hand made. Gourmet Italian food, family style. Classy and great atmosphere. Now. The Dish.Gnocchi with White Wine Truffle Lobster Sauce.Yes, that got the five stars from me :), One of my favorite restaurants in DC. You know youre in for something good when you enter an Italian restaurant where Italian ladies are hand-making ravioli in the window (being a hockey fan, its tough to resist banging on the windows frantically and cheering them on in their pasta-making). Its not a particularly big place, but the atmosphere feels intimate rather than cramped.The food is absolutely incredible. Hearty Italian concoctions and full of deliciousness. Of course I would recommend their pastas - fresh and homemade with spectacular sauces. Pretty much anything with gnocchi or ravioli is good.Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about their food. The food can get on the expensive side, but the taste is totally worth it. Great for a date or family dinner., I had an early dinner here tonight around 3:30PM today. This was my second time eating here. My first experience here was a few years ago and wasnt very memorable, so it was almost like trying the place for the first time..The place was empty, with the exception of two women finishing up their meals. The restaurant appeared to be getting ready for the dinner rush as various employees appeared to get ready for their shifts and finish setting the tables.I ordered an iced tea to drink which was great and had a light fruity flavor.To start I ordered a caesar salad, which came with two pieces of bread covered in melted mozzarella cheese, yum! Both were great!As my meal I got fettucine alfredo with chicken, which wasnt on the menu, but was available upon request. The pasta was a little too well cooked for me and the sauce wasnt quite as flavorful as other alfredo sauces Ive tasted and was a little thin. The chicken was good. Overall, it was okay. The portions were huge!My friend got the cavatelli - ricotta dumplings with a creamy tomato sauce. I tried a bite and the taste was good, but the texture of the dumplings wasnt really something I would enjoy.We had no room for dessert!I do really like the atmosphere of this place!Overall, my experience was okay. Next time Ill try the manicotti and try to save room for dessert!, The dishes here are best done family style and you do not go away hungry! The best thing about this place is the decor. Although a little clustered, it has a family feel to it. If you can sit in Clintons favorite room - I highly recommend it!, Excellent food but be warned portions are HUGE - share or take some home for leftovers. Excellent desserts and dessert selection as well. Complimentary sambuca & amaretto after the meal were a very nice touch. Good ambiance but bad acoustics - once the restaurant filled up it was so loud that it was hard to hear the conversation at our table of 4. Our service was not very good - our waiter spilled sauce on my shirt and jacket and was not at all concerned about it, not to mention he also incorrectly assumed his tip amount instead of bringing us back the remaining cash from the bill. Id definitely return for the food and hope to get a different waiter., Some of the best, and I mean best, italian food Ive had in DC.Appetizers:I recommend the rice balls and the unbreaded calamari. The calamari sauce is great to soak into the complimentary bread. We also had the caprice salad but I left it for the vegetarian at our table, although it looked beautiful.Entree:Penne con salciche was great. The salciche was very subtle in its spice, and had a great bite to it. Spinach and cheese ravioli with cream sauce was excellent. It wouldnt surprise me if the cream sauce was butter with some herbs. Good for dinner, bad for diet, good for tastebuds. But if youre eating there, you know what youre getting yourself into.My favorite was the seafood risotto. Lined with mussels, shrimp, calamari, scallops and clams, the risotto was cooked thoroughly and in a great sauce. Its crazy to think now that we almost didnt order it. After dinner they give you a complimentary sambuca and amaretto.We also opted to have a slice of their tiramisu between the three of us, a perfectly sweet touch to end the epic meal. The portions are huge, but it doesnt mean they sacrifice any taste to make it so. I have two lbs of food in my fridge that Im excited to reheat.Thanks to Dino and Harris for the kind service and hospitality., A friend brought me here for my birthday dinner in october, yes Im a little late in reviewing, but I really enjoyed this place. Yes, the decor is unusual at best, I was there for halloween, crazy, but once you get past that the food is delicious! We ordered two dishes, the waiter mixed things up and only got one of our orders which was definitely for the best since the portion was so so big we couldnt even finish one entree! I love the little old lady in the window working away, making all the delicious pastas and the service was very good except our bizarre missing entree that became a positive thing in the end.I love the sambuca and amaretto after dinner drink, It was a nice touch. I hope to be back soon!!, Took a date to Filomena on vday. The place was packed - and quite a nice experience. When you walk in, there are these 2 grandmotherly ladies making pasta in the window, and it was, well, really cute i must say. We were given a great table in the corner, looking out at the entire restaurant. Everything is homemade. And nearly everything we had was delicious. A bottle of Prosecca kicked things off nicely. The famous Ceasar Salad was disappointing. It just didn have that egg/anchovy/ garlicky consistency that i prefer. This was more of a creamy ceasar. Flavor was great, but a little too creamy for me, which made the romaine limp and just not as fresh tasting as i would have liked. But then the Pasta....whoa boy....this was one helluva dish. Linguini w/ lobster meat in a lobster sauce. Incredible. Like - maybe the best pasta dish ever. What a treat. Then, we finished with some strawberry cheesecake. WOW was that good. The best. And they finished the experience with a very nice touch - they deliver a decantur of Amaretto and Sambuca w/ coffee beans, and let you drink at your leisure. I mean....how Cool is That? The service was very nice, the food overall was just amazing, and the experience was very pecial occasion Highly rated., Had Sunday brunch here with a party of 10. Its decent but not special. Eggs, Italian dishes, the B-list desserts. We wont go back., After hearing much buzz about this joint, I checked it out with a couple friends during Restaurant Week. Overall experience at Filomena would be 2-stars at best, but the Italian food itself is so delicious, that it redeemed itself. Ambiance -- 2 stars. The obnoxious Vday decor hanging above the tables and on the walls are almost so tacky it was forgivable. The tables are literally right on top of each other, and they squeezed three of us into a table for two-- which was troublesome when we ordered a bottle of wine to add to our already tight space. Food -- 5 stars. Seriously, the best Italian food Ie had yet in this town. I started with the Funghi all Fiorentina which was a great choice. Mushrooms stuffed with cheeses and spinach served over a fantastic cream sauce. For the entree, I sided with Linguine Alla Carbonara. Again, fantastic dish with enough left over for 2 more meals. Dessert: Raspberries and Cream. A delicious raspberry mousse with a layer of chocolate cake in between whipped cream, fresh raspberries with a glaze on top. Wine: 2 stars: Bottle of Santa Margherita Lison-Pramaggiore, Veneto 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon. I not a wine snob, but this bottle disappointed, very acidic. Service: 2 stars: nothing extraordinary, pretty run of the mill. But the didn seem to rush us along as we dined, even though it was a packed house. Overall experience: 3 stars: If youe looking for Italian food that won disappoint, this is certainly the right place. The dining experience didn leave too much of a lasting impression on me -- just had too much hype to live up to., We hadnt been for years, but after going last month, we were wondering why it had been so long. The food is outstanding, the pastas are fresh and tasty, and you have enough for three meals.The decor is well, 50s Italian, but when the food is that good, who cares., GREAT FOOD. SHITTY SERVICE.We went to Filomena for lunch during restaurant week. It wasn busy at all. We were seated without menus. Then our server comes by 10 mins later asking if we are ready to order. With what menus? So he brings us menus and then disappears for another 10 mins. Food takes a while to come and even had to ask what is going on. Plates arrive and the portions are HUGE. Definitely took some home. Server comes by with the check. Problem is, it the WRONG check. So we flag him down ten mins later. He gives us our check and it only $14.95. He didn charge for one of the plates but we figured it was because he spilled parmasean cheese all over my sleeve. We pay and a few mins later he comes back and said he made a mistake and didn give us the correct bill but corrected it and charged our card anyway! I was a bit pissed because common courtesy would tell you, HEY check with the people at the table and let them know youe charging them a different amount! But no, he charges the card and tells us after.At this point, I happy to be leaving after spending 2 hours at Filomena. Maybe it was the servers first day but I should have said something to the manager. Oh and the decor was really tacky., Great pasta. Great desserts. Love the free sambuca and amaretto. Service wasnt that great. However, Id go back., The food here is amazing, but unfortunately, the decor is so over the top, that it distracts from the meal itself. Ive gone around Christmas and Halloween time and its looked like each holiday puked all over the restaurant. SO GAWDY! But I digress...I have ordered the same thing twice-the creamy pesto ravioli dish and ya know what? Id probably order it again. All the pastas are home made by a little old lady who sits near the entrance in a weird little room, that I think is supposed to look like an old-world kitchen. Im not sure...again...its all part of the embedded tackiness. The service isnt that great either.Their selection of cheese cakes is also quite impressive. I have even brought a piece home with me in the past. Even though everything but the food sucks at Filomena, its still worth a visit, if only for the fresh pasta and yummy cheese cakes!, The best Italian food Ive ever eaten, bar none. And ive eaten my share of Italian food.I love the Ravioli here, and the hand-made Gnocchi is fantastic. The marinara sauce is so good, I am almost tempted to just get a bowl of it and eat it with a spoon. Try the Arancini balls for appetizer - my fiancee and I get them every time we come. Weve never gotten the dessert, but they look amazing.Despite the 5 star rating, the service is admittedly suspect, at best. We have been to this place many times, and the service has been steady declining, though the food remains as awesome as ever. The place is also kinda small and crowded, so be prepared for long waits on popular nights if you havent made a reservation. In terms of the food, I cant recommend this place enough. If youre particular about service, you may not like it quite as much, but the food will definitely not disappoint., I love Filomena for the atmosphere alone. Its large and bustling and you feel like you could run into a celebrity or politico at any time. The waiters are all so charming, even if a little overly flirtatious. Nothing wrong with that, as long as they provide good service.Ive been here a couple of times... as a large group and as a couple. Both times I had the same entree: Festivale in Venezia ($36.95). Its spicy with housemade black fettuccine. I could eat a pound of the pasta alone. Throw in lobster, crab, shrimp, and scallops, and youve won me over. The first time I had this dish, it was overflowing with lobster and crab. The second time, it was a bit skimpy on the good stuff, but still a nice dish.Ive also had Mozzarella in Carrozza. It was creamy and delicious. I know Ive had a couple other appetizers, but its been a while (and I was drunk) so I dont remember.Rule of thumb when dining at Filomena... save room for dessert! My favorite is the Rasberry Marquis. They had me with chocolate and raspberries, truly my biggest dessert weakness. Ive also had the Chocolate Truffle and Dark Chocolate Mousse. (Can you tell I love chocolate?)And I almost forgot, they provide complimentary sambuca and amaretto at every table. Big bonus!, I went here with my fiance and his parents for Easter, precisely because of how funny we think the decorations are and also because the food is good (wed been once before, also at Easter time). The food was good again, but service was so-so. Our waitress was not enthusiastic/friendly (I overheard waiters/waitresses at other tables who were, and explained the menu, gave recommendations, etc.). She brought us the dessert menu, and by the time she came back to take our order 15 minutes later we decided not to get any because wed had to wait so long.I was also extremely annoyed to have been carded, and with my bad luck I had forgotten my wallet at home, so no wine or amaretto/sambuca for me. This is pretty annoying because I am 24 and have also NEVER been carded when Ive clearly been with people who are of my parents age. For a restaurant where were probably spending $40/plate it seems kind of silly to treat patrons in this way. I was obviously not going to get drunk and disorderly...just wanted to enjoy some wine with my pasta.And yes, all the name-dropping on their menu is annoying and kind of tasteless., We arrived for our reservation and were seated 30-45 minutes late.I actually liked the decor and atmosphere. I found it entertaining. The food, however, was mostly disappointing. I went with a group of 6 and I ordered wine - the Sangiovese - which was very good. We had a bit of a mishap at the table and the waiter spilled a glass of wine on the table splashing red wine on several of us. He was very nice and did everything he could to make up for the mistake. The manager took 10% off of our bill which was a nice touch. For appetizers, we ordered Calamari Fritti and Arancini (rice balls). The rice balls were very tasty and we all enjoyed them very much. The calamari, however, was rubbery and flavorless. We returned it and asked them to replace it with another order of rice balls. They brought our rice balls but the chef really wanted to prove he could make good calamari and sent another order of calamari to the table - on the house. This time it was slightly more crispy but still had not flavor and no one at the table cared for it. Those who got salads said they were very good.The waiter was kind enough to ask us if we wanted to sit and breath for a while before our entrees arrived but since we had been seated so late and with the spill and everything else, it was getting quite late. I ordered the Ravioli di Chiacchieri and was assured by the waiter that the lobster sauce was delicious. The scallops were rubbery and extremely overcooked. Probably the worst scallops Ive ever been served. The sauce was OK but nothing to get excited over. I tried the Gnocchi della Mamma which was very good. Ive never had Gnocchi before so really cant compare it to much but I did like it very much. I had no room for dessert. The portions were very large. I had packed a box to take home and still had no room for dessert. But then, we ate too many appetizers since the chef insisted on giving us another order of calamari.I would probably not return but would just order the right things next time if I did. It was expensive and there were too many items that were not cooked properly or just didnt taste good. I expect more from some lower end restaurants that I enjoy. I cant believe the scallops were so bad. Really bad. I dont cook and can make better scallops., My boyfriend and I had wanted to go to Filomena for Valentine day but by the time we went to make our reservations, they were all gone. We decided to go last week to celebrate his new job and we both loved it and he is very particular about Italian restaurants. Our reservation was for 6:30 on a Friday night. We arrived about 5 minutes early and were immediately taken to our table. Being a Friday, it was busy and one thing I was not too crazy about was how close the tables are. It was not too bad though as we could barely hear what the people on either side of us were saying. They did sit a party of 3 at a table meant for 2 though. The place was still decorated for Easter and while somewhat tacky, was not too over the top. Anyway, on to the food. We ordered the Antipastino Misto as an appetizer. Very good. They brought it out with their amazing bread and olive oil/spices. The cheeses on the appetizer were very good as well as the meat and the mushroom/roasted red peppers in the middle were very yummy. I ordered the Ravioli della Michele which when I bit into it, the filling was on the cold side. The waiter was more than apologetic and said it would be no problem to get another order. When it did come out it was very good. The smoked chicken inside was different (in a good way) from anything I have had before. My boyfriend ordered the Neopolitan Ragu Con Rigatoni which he loved. He said the sauce was great and very much like the gravy his father makes. The portions are large so I was too full for desert. He had the Tira Mi Su and said it was very good. We did not know about the complementary Sambuca and Amaretto at the end of the meal, we just thought the people who had been sitting next to us who received the bottles were big spenders. The service was attentive and our waiter was very nice. We will definitely come back again., Apparently this place is legendary - from Bono to the Clintons - everyone loves Filomena... I would concur that its worth a visit. Food was good.. not necessarily mind blowing but good. Started with the stuffed mushrooms with sausage and the antipasto platter - both were great. I ordered the lasagna - sauce was amazing, but there was too much cheese (the waiter warned me about this but I felt like ordering it- note to self: take recommendations not go against them) my collegues had other dishes - the Linguini with crab and lobster and the Penne with Sausage (Apparently Bonos fave) were both good as well. There was way too much food - you could literally share a dish. The Tiramisu is worth the visit alone - not too sweet and absolutely delightful! Id return back to Filomena the next time im in DC!, Cannelloni frutti di mare - yes! Ditto on the arancini.Not the best food, not the winner of the let me wow you with my culinary skills contest, but still way more enjoyable than Spezie et al. -- sometimes there nothing better than a triple portion of lobster and scallop -stuffed cannelloni.Great dim atmosphere (albeit kitschy). A real blast from the past; one of the only places in the District that hasn had the character sucked out., Wow. This was Italy as done in Vegas on mescalin. Everything about this restaurant is completely over the top and rivals the Liberace Museum and restaurant on East Trop. in Sin City. Actually, Liberace might have showed more restraint than this Georgetown legend. The restaurant itself is dimly lit, and people are packed in. Im not kidding - I watched them create 3 tables on Saturday that didnt actually exist. In a city that likes discretion, the menu covers list the names of celebrities that have dined at this DC staple. The inside of the menu also points out the star-studded favorite dishes. I ordered Tony Bennets favorite dish, the ravioli della michele. The pasta is exceptional - handmade by the pasta mammas. (But the smoked chicken was too smoky and overwhelmed the dish). My gramma wanted to offer her help to the ladies on the way into the restaurant, but we wouldnt let her. Now, my gramma is one of the worlds pickiest eaters, and she actually dipped the gnocchi into the pasta sauce, which for her, is a revelation. The service was a bit hit or miss - but I suspect it was more to do with the fact that the waiter couldnt hear us over the constant roar of the packed in diners. He only brought me a salad, even though 3 of us had ordered it. He debated my fiance over whether to put his seafood dish should actually go into the bread bowl. The waiter said no, fiance agreed, but then it showed up in the bread bowl. I was only able to manage a few bites of cheesecake after only eating half of my too-smoky ravioli, but it too was amazing. The food is really great, and the portions are huge, along with the prices. The wine by the glass needs work too.Its worth going, but I dont think Ill be a regular., I had lunch a late lunch (230ish) at Filomena during the week. There were a total of maybe 12-15 people in the restaurant (5 from my party), but service was terrible. We had to ask for refills on our drinks several times. Our waiter was a little bit rude also.We started with bruschetta and calamari. The bruschetta was some pita bread with tomatoes, onion, basil and other typical bruschetta toppings. I wasnt very impressed with the bruschetta. The pita bread should have been toasted, but it was soaked in olive oil and a bit soggy.The calamari was also a disappointment. They were tasteless and rubbery. It was something I would expect from Olive Garden. The lunch menu is really big and has a ton of pastas, sandwiches, pizzas, etc to choose from. I decided on the seafood cannelloni. It was shrimp, crabmeat, scallops and cheeses wrapped in black pasta sheets served in an amazing lobster sauce. The lunch portion was the perfect size (2 cannelloni) and reasonably priced at $13. This was by far one of the best pasta dishes Ive ever tasted. The sauce was very creamy, but not too thick. The seafood wasnt overpowered by the pasta or the sauces. It was very delicious., I like this restaurant a lot. From the old lady making pasta in the entrance greeting you with a nod and smile to the decor in the main dining room its an absolute great interior. Ive been here multiple times and have not been disappointed. Its pricey, but with the size of the portions it is worth it. The home made pasta is what makes me come back every time. Im confident that most everything on the menu is good. Service is great here too. The waiters have personality and like to chat., Decent food in one of those delightfully tacky but very Italian settings. It was very charming. Not necessarily a good place to dine alone on a Friday night when youe in town for business though; I seemed to be the topic of many nearby conversations as one diner would notice me, say something to their table mates, then everyone would turn and/or crane their necks to look at me, feel bad because I watching them all turn and look, and then quickly look away and discuss it out of the corner of their mouths and laugh. Those people should owe me a glass of wine.I think I may have offended by not enjoying my traditional sign of Italian hospitality glass of sambucca or amaretto. At that point I just wanted to bolt and I was about to die from the carb intake anyway. Props for my waitress calling my miss and asking if I was 21 when I ordered a glass of pinot grigio, props to the ladies making gnocchi when you first walk in, and props to the guy (manager?) that came by to check on me a few times and was very friendly and wanted to make sure I was enjoying myself.If youe a celebrity junkie you might get a kick out of ordering a dish Bono wanted seconds of, or the one that Bill Clinton orders for everyone when he comes in, or the one that Clint Eastwood insisted Ryan Philippe try. If youe me, you might just be happy to see that they offer a whole wheat option, which sadly, I guess isn made in house., Great high end restaurant without getting too overpriced. Truly enjoyed the food and the service was decent. Here are some dishes Ive tried:Arancini - Loved it. Sort of a fried kind of mozzarella ball filled with sausage and rice. Served with perfectly tangy tomato sauce that was perfectly paired with the arancini. One of my favorite appetizers so far... sort of yummy crunchy mozzarella with meaty goodness.Agnolotti alla Panna - Basically ravioli with ricotta and spinach with cream sauce. I wouldnt order this dish again as it was way too heavy for me and they also pour way too much sauce over the ravioli. Maybe thats how its supposed to be but just way too much for my taste.Linguini Cardinale - Linguine with creamy lobster sauce. The consistency of the sauce to pasta ratio was good. Lots of chunks of lobster meat... more than I expected! The sauce was very... lobster-y. I love love love lobster and I would recommend it only to people who can take a strong and rich lobster taste.Tiramisu - To die for. Please, do yourself a favor and order this but save some for me! I am not a dessert person but this is just amazingly good. Light and airy and the lady fingers are soaked with the right amount of espresso and liquor. Each light and creamy bite are so worth stuffing my face even after a super rich and heavy pasta dish earlier. Perhaps next time Ill just have appetizer and skip straight to the tiramisu!, Lunch buffet was brilliant, its a real deal. Pastas, salads, desserts were all very nice. Its dim inside but the atmosphere was great and suitable for an Italian meal. Miss the pasta there, every bite is a reminder that you must come back soon., Would I have come here of my own will? Probably not. I not a huge fan of Italian food, and especially not traditional pasta-and-lasagna kind. But the S.O. father was in town and this was his place of choice. The decor - very, very old school, sort of like your grandparentshouse where the sofa and dining room chairs are wrapped in plastic. The atmosphere was interesting - in contrast to the dim lighting and old-fashioned furniture, the noise level was quite high and the crowd very lively. The food... Italian comfort food at its heaviest. I am convinced there is no way to eat at Filomena and avoid a debilitating food coma. This is not to say everything wasn delicious, but it was definitely a calorie binge - creamy sauces, buttery pasta, breaded and fried foods galore. Very decadent. Service was pretty solid - out server was attentive, patient, and accommodating. Definitely skip if youe looking for a place to start the night versus go home and lay on the couch with your pants unzipped, too full to breathe. But overall - a very solid place and I would be happy to return. 3.5 stars., I dont know if Im missing something, but I just dont get the allure of this place. The food is fine, but nothing spectacular. The prices seem exorbitant for pasta, but given the grotesquely large portion sizes, perhaps they assume that people are getting 2-3 meals out of one dish so then the prices are reasonable? I found the decor tacky and the room incredibly loud--impossible to have a conversation. So for fine-dining prices without the fine-dining food or ambience, it was sorely disappointing., Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!If you love authentic Italian food with a Tuscan atmosphere, then this place is for you! We loved our seafood pasta and the lobster ravioli. The desserts are rich and plentiful. The service is excellent.The restaurant is extremely crowded. Reservations are a must. In fact, given the economy, I was surprised to see so many large parties of diners coming in and out of the restaurant.I am surprised by the lackluster reviews of Filomena on Yelp. We have lived in San Francisco and LA, and definitely thought Filomena was top notch and on par with the Italian restaurants in these other cities.I would put it on a top-10 DC list., Actually 3.5 stars, but its a rounding up kind of day. =) We went here last week, and on first sight from outside, this restaurant doesnt look as big as it actually is. So anyway, its a nice night out, and we are greeted at the entrance by the cute pasta mama in the window making gnocchi. Seriously shes adorable. Anyway, we walk downstairs and immediately I think to myself Im in some cheesy restaurant in North Beach (San Francisco) with fake grapes and bad floral all over the place. I have to admit, Im a little, just a little turned off - but its usually these kind of places that really do have great food. Anyway we sit down at our little table and I take a gander at the neighbors entree size, and while I am post-wedding-eat-the-shit-out-of-everything, I couldnt stomach the size of the entree - for once, my eyes are as big as my stomach. So we ordered an appetizer, salad, entree and desert - TO SHARE. Appetizer, fried ravioli served with marinara - this was really good, very fresh very tasty. Salad, greens, pecans, gorgonzola - this is where I docked a point, I didnt care for the salad at all. Entree, ricotta dumplings w/ tomato cream sauce - theres not a lot of vegetarian options (perils of living on the east coast) , but this was a good pick, since it was so huge, we brought it home and ate it for dinner last night, it was amazing after the spices had all sunk in. Dessert, tiramisu - yummy yummy yummy, thats all. I would however pass on the complimentary amaretto / sambuca after the meal., I mostly agree with all the other reviewers here, but I have to hold this place close to my heart for several reasons.1. You can make reservations via OpenTable.com2. Bhumika K. called her the pasta mama, or I call her the Italian grandma rolling gnocchi in the window. I *heart* gnocchi btw.3. Celeb shout-outs in the menu. Ok, I hate that they name-drop like that, but then Im tickled that I love what Clint Eastwood loves, so whos the dumb one here?4. This place is a must at holidays - they go over the top and its so gaudy/tacky its cute. I love this place at Christmas, Halloween and Valentines Day. Its like another world there.5. My boyfriend who is a chicken-parmigiana connoisseur gives this place 2 thumbs up.I recently had the manicotti which turned out to be 1 big fat manicotti that I didnt love, but the gnocchi dish is huge (a little dense for my taste) and the ravioli was ok. But their chicken parmigiana is a solid winner every time and so is the tiramisu. Love the after-dinner sips (sambuca/amaretto) also., Work lunch. I long for the day when I can call it a business lunch, but I not there yet. Nope.Def has some kitsch. I sit down and It Amore starts playing. I realize America really got exposed to Italy in the 50s - Connie Francis, Sinatra, the Sharks & the Jets....well, the Jets...but it time to update that outlook, and maybe we need to look to the Motherland to provide us with a more refreshed view. What if all American restaurants looked like Johnny Rockets & Ed Debevic and played the same Elvis album over and over and over? So why is it ok to relegate poor little Italy-America to that period. And leave them there. I started out w/ the bruschetta. If one more waiter tries to correct me on that pronounciation, I swear, I may just get up and walk out. Sch in Italian = Sk. I majored in Spanish, but I stay loyal to all romance languages. If you want to say it another way, that fine. Just don correct me, the damn linguist, ok? (Calling myself a linguist is very much a stretch, but wee gonna roll with it). Anyway, the bruschetta came with a soft pizza crust. It was far from haute cuisine, but it was tasty, I must say. It had cubed fresh mozz which I didn expect. Then I had the spinach agnolotti and this stuff came out HOT, steaming HOT. I decided to have a 5 minute convo to give it some time...still hot, suspiciously hot (hint, hint). When I finally managed to bite into one, I found it could have been more al dente, but was not bad. Overall, not horrible, but not the greatest., Generally speaking, the giant picture of Bill Clinton that greets you upon entering Filomena would not on its own be terribly indicative of quality, given our former President relatively wide and undiscerning appreciation for anything labeled as food. However, in the case of Filomena, old Bill might have got it right. The meal was initially set up for disappointment. We were desperate and hungry, having failed to find agreement among our family of four as to what we would eat for lunch during a recent visit to our nation capitol. In addition, The kitschy interior, the old broads in furs, the Russian waiter -- all these elements further hinted at an experience that we anticipated might very well be lackluster and disappointing. Boy, were we wrong.Our pasta and Caprese salad were delicious, prepared perfectly and on par with much of the food we ate when we lived in Bologna. Our Russian waiter was polite and efficient. The old broads captivated with their conversation and mannerisms. And the kitschy interior kinda grows on you -- similar to the effect Bill Clinton has on some people. Next time I in DC and need to take a Democrat out to lunch, I know where Il take him., I did not get to see the famed Italian ladies hand pulling pasta in the front of the restaurant. I was able to experience the super crazy seasonal decorations, though. I cant speak to the dinner service, but lunch seems like a relative bargain with prices about a third of the cost. Sure, the menu differs, but all I want is my tasty, tasty linguine alla vongole. I usually shy away from buffets, but the antipasti they had out included some really great dishes. All in all I think we paid around $18 a person with a pasta dish each and the buffet included. Seems like a choice place to restore your energy after shopping in Georgetown. Theyre super friendly, which is why they get the 4 stars., (Sorry, wrote this review a few months ago, but never posted it!)Charming!! Filomena, always a cozy and welcoming space, was decorated beautifully with Easter decorations galore!! Huge stuffed bunnies perched over banquettes, easter baskets filled with smaller bunnies, birdies and treats were hung from the ceiling, and a full size donkey led a cart filled with baby bunnies. Now, for the food - filling and good. Its hard to get a really bad meal here - but really great isnt as easy as it should be. The lasagna portion was huge, but my date complained there was not enough meat, ricotta and cheese - and for the price...not so great. My ravioli with lobster sauce, shrimp and scallops - healthy portion, but over sauced - cloyingly so. Service was attentive, but overly busy with tables, so slow. Will go back.
23|fiola-mare-washington|Lmore al primo morso! I really really love this place! Fiola Mare is THE place for authentic and classy Italian cooking and fresh seafood lovers! I am giving a perfect 5 with much confidence at my first visit right now. From the personal greeting by the elegant Maria Trabocchi, to Maine Peektoe Crab antipasti, to my half portion Bucatini with Red King Prawns and Sea Urchin, and finally to the dessert Baba al Rhum, everything and I mean everything was impeccable. Our lady bartender was very nice and knowledgeable too., The menu was the most thoughtful and creative selection Ive ever seen. You could tell that each ingredient was really considered and carefully sourced to create a special dining experience. The Bucatini was amazing and the wine pairings suggested to us were just right., Two dinners so far. Fabio is a master chef. The restaurant is beautiful. Unlike so many restaurants these days it is relatively quiet. All the food I have tried so far is excellent. Prices are moderate to expensive. Motivation to earn more money. Lobster and lobster Ravioli are standouts. Smoked Black Cod fish is fantastic. Oysters with caviar and creme was to die for. Enjoy, Great new restaurant and finally a chance to get some great food on the Georgetown Waterfront. Dont be scared, this is not the below average Tony & Joes or Sequoia that are just relying on water views. Went there on a Saturday night with my wife and had a wonderful dinner. Lots of very interesting, well thought out menu items. The lump crab cake salad was wonderful. So too the lobster ravioli and ahi tuna appetizer. Servers were knowledgeable and recommended good wine pairings. Great dinner all around and when the weather warms up, will offer outdoor seating along the river., We love Fiola, and think its one of the best Italian restaurants weve been to in the U.S. so we had to try Fiola Mare for brunch Sunday and, unfortunately, it does not currently live up to the standards of its companion restaurant BUT Im sure it will improve and Ill be happy to upgrade my rating at that time.Service: Everyone was nice but we received incorrect dishes and occasionally the waiter would miss a drink order and we would have to order again. Nothing major and something that should be cleaned up in the future but also something I wouldnt except from a Fiola property.Food: Food was fine, certain dishes better than others. The poached eggs, when cooked properly, were excellent but unfortunately, the two eggs on our plates were unevenly poached (one overdone) which was unexpected. Setting: Excellent setting with views of the Potomac. We will go back and hopefully have a better time., My god, the food here is fantastic. Went with a medium sized group to brunch this weekend and I can say enough about the quality of the food. We had both traditional brunch foods and some seafood dishes, all of which were great both in portion sizes and quality.Service: absolutely awful. Our waiter had an attitude as soon as we walked in. There were less than 50 people dining in the entire restaurant, and had to be about 12-15 staff there. Ie never seen that many people walking around doing a terrible job. Our waiter came by VERY rarely, drinks took an extremely long time to arrive. We had to flag him down to take our order after the appetizer plates had been cleared for over ten minutes. At the end of the meal, even though we had written down amounts to charge to our cards, he was unable to split the check correctly, charging over $200 more than what was on the tab.Overall, the brunch took almost 3.5 hours from the time we showed up to when we left. The Wine Manager came over to apologize for the wait, handing us his card and inviting us to call him if we needed anything. Not sure how helpful that is, but maybe we can give him a ring for wine suggestions when we head to whole foods.The Chef and the water guy were great. I feel bad for the folks in the kitchen because the food they put out is incredible.Would go again...for takeout., I absolutely LOVED this place. This weekend, we happened to stumble upon this spot and we are so happy we decided to go in and try something new. Food - Awesome. I had the oysters and lobster ravioli.Service - 10 stars! Our waiter, his name was Adam, took beyond exceptional care of us. Thank you!!The drinks from the bar were also great - no complaints.Ill definitely be returning!, Cyndys Bottom Line: Excellent service by Arturo (sp?) and delicious Italian inspired seafood dishes in a beautiful setting. 4.75 stars for the food.5 stars for service5 stars for ambianceThere is valet service which is located at the front entrance 31st and K. We missed the entrance and the valet and went into the public parking garage. Will definitely use the valet on our next visit. They are so friendly and nice!I love the location on the Georgetown waterfront with spectacular beautiful views of the water and the outlying area.We were taken to our table and were so lucky to have a booth that is facing the water and to be in Arturos section.I started with a glass of Prosecco, Le Vigne di Alice, Doro, Brut Superiore, Veneto, Italy. Divine bubbles!Hubby had the Redemption Rye Manhattan.Arturo recommend a bottle of the Isole e Olena, Tuscany 2012 to pair with our food. It was excellent.Arturo explained the entire menu to us. Provided great passionate descriptions of all the dishes. We selected most of Arturos recommendations:1. Catalina Sea Urchin Panna Cotta -Foie Gras, Espelette, Sake Infused Caviar Squid Ink Brioche. Creaminess of the panna cotta with the urchin is brilliant! The brioche was so useful to soak up all of the panna cotta. 2. Quinault Tribe Wild Razor Clams Roman Puntarelle & Anchovies DressingBeautiful presentation of a salad. The razor clams were sweet and succulent. The anchovies were a perfect compliment to the razor clams. The dressing was light not to over power the fresh flavor of the seafood.3. Burrata of Buffalo Mozzarella - Baby Artichokes, Anchovies, Sea Lettuce, Cucumbers, Pesto of Basil Genovese.We shared this dish and it was plated separately. Love the attention to detail. The burrata was creamy with perfect texture. A delicious refreshing salad.4. Fiola Maine Lobster Ravioli - Ginger, Chives. Magnificent! The raviolis were nicely stuffed with delightful lobster and the wrappers were so delicate. They melt in your mouth.5. Smoked Potato Gnocchi - Wild Turbot, Baby Artichokes, Almonds, Italian Parsley.I enjoyed the components of this dish except for the smokiness which I thought was a bit too intense and it tasted too herbaceous for my palate. The turbot was done perfectly.We had to cancel our next order because we were way to full and I was saving room for the bomboloni.6. Ricotta Bomboloni Burnt Honey Gelato - every bite is so divine! It is so yummy with the gelato. The next visit I will order it first to go with my prosecco!7. Baba al Rhum - Vanilla Crema, Pear Marmellata, Toasted Alba Hazelnuts. Decadence!!! The vanilla crema was so lusciously delicious all by itself. The pear was yummy sweetness.8. Macarons and almond cookies - a nice touch to a wonderful time!, (PART 2 of 2)A major component of Fiola Mare is the open market counter with whole fish and crustaceans to be picked for grilling. When we saw Langostines, we had to order them as they are hard to find in the DC area. They were split in half then grilled to a smoky charred outside and tender inside topped with citrus zest, chili oil, and chives. The shell was grilled to a gentle singe so that glucosamine-lovers like me could chomp with delight. Since we enjoyed the Langostines as they were, the delicious accompanying sauces (a refreshing fennel aioli, zippy salsa verde, and a spicy calabrese chili mayo) made great bread dip.As amazing as the Langostines were, the Grilled Whole John Dory was simply flawless. For our lunch visit, we were considering the Turbot and the Spanish Branzino, but when one of the maitre d mentioned John Dory, our gustatory memories transported back two decades to Harry Bar in Venice. When we approached the counter with inquiries, Executive Chef John Melfi came out to help us. Affable and easy-going, he answered our questions and convinced us when he said it is one of his very favorite fish and assured us that he would take care of our fish. Lo and behold, the John Dory was prepared to absolute perfection! While my DC could nitpick about some parts of the langostine being too tender, we were floating in the clouds with every bite, from the Dover Sole-like texture of the mild filet, to the progressively more flavorful and crunchy tails, fins, and jaw/head. Supreme freshness of whole fish can be detected when sampling the eye area, and needless to say, bubble tea-like eyes were the epitome of fresh.Among Executive Pastry Chef Tom Wellingscreations, the Magnum, Torta Limone, and the Passion Fruit Sgroppino stood out for us. The first one was the most glamorous ice cream bar--a vanilla-blood orange gelato dipped in white chocolate and decorated with blood orange gel39e, zest, and edible pansies. Although the shell could be thinner, the entire composition was stunning to look at and to devour. One of two aforementioned complementary desserts, the Torta al Limone, was a fabulously tart dessert of Meyer Lemon curd and candied zest over a moist shortbread, all garnished with tender mini merengues, yuzu gel39e, and a coconut sorbet. Aside from the coconut fragrance being a too mellow, I loved all components as well as the whole composition fancified by gold foil. Tart sweets have been appealing to me lately, and this one rocked my palate!For something lighter, we have enjoyed the Sgroppino--a signature of Chef Trabocchi from the Maria Menus at Fiola and Casa Luca. There are always ways to improve upon even a great treat made of Prosecco and a fruit sorbet--and what better way than using the floral fruit with striking yellow color (not to mention our favorite fruit) then jazzing it up with the sweet grape wine, Moscato! As a boozy aside, the Bellini is fantastic, very lightly sweet and fragrant with white peach complete with a supremely refreshing finishing note.Overall, Fiola Mare is actualizing its vision of focusing on Fiola fine seafood selections but with a greater emphasis on raw, crudo, and grilled preparations in addition to cooked dishes and pastas. Certainly, there is still work to be done in terms of shoring up a steadier flow of service without big gaps, tie up loose ends (i.e. please add back the nuts into the salads that make Fiola/Casa Luca so thoroughly dominating), and a lighter touch for more sophisticated seafood eaters (i.e. lighter on the citrus, rosemary, and butter). However, after only 9 days into its existence, Fiola Mare is showing promise to be the crown jewel among Chef Trabocchi restaurants--a remarkable achievement for the world-class master chef who has become DC hottest restaurateur with two of DC best restaurants!, One of the best overall restaurants Ive been to in terms of food and ambiance! I seriously cannot rec it enough.The ahi tuna crudo is to diiiiie for AMAZING. Like you absolutely have to have it. Seriously. The tuna slices are huge fatty sashimi style. Incredibly fresh and unbelievably flavorful. It comes with a rich citrus dressing salad blend with light greens and thick blood orange rounds on top of a light fluffy and just crispy enough pancake like bread. Oh my god. So good. Basically an entire meal and a good size to share too. The raw crudo scallops are also delicious. Very very well and thickly seasoned! The scallops basically melt in your mouth and have the consistency between jello and giant tapioca - kind of reminiscent of rice noodle rolls. melty, chewy, slimy, but also solid. I swear it tastes a lot better than the description would suggest...The colors of the garden salad with heirloom radicchio and blood oranges and tangerines was beautifully done and delicious (they split it in two for us) but also incredibly underwhelming compared to everything else. (Also see my Fiola review bc I basically had a kale salad there that MADE MY LIFE and no salad since has compared). Caviar with froth was delicious but the staging of the caviar could have been done much better. The gnocchi was great if you like gnocchi but I wouldnt recommend it unless youre craving gnocchi. If you want pasta go for the lobster ravioli as many reviewers would recommend. Whoops.The passion fruit and seasoned fruit sorbet took FOREVER to get to us. Very passion fruity - the sorbet was perfect. The seasoned fruit was soggy and peaches I think which...its March? Is that seasonal? They also gave us pistachio-flavored cookie balls or something to end the night, complementary. HOLY MOTHER DELICIOUS. Im pretty sure its an actual dessert too so order that!Service was great. The waiter was attentive but not overly so. The food was staged and plated and served at exactly the right time. They paid attention to when we finished but not in an awkward gawking at us way. Our plates were taken away professionally (a little awkwardly bc we were snuggling and they came in from behind us as is most professional so we kind of threw them off. whoops) and everyone was wonderful, smily, professional, and (almost) seamless. The service got a little slow towards the end... But otherwise was great. All in all. I WILL BE BACK. Especially as the menu changes to try new things. The food was amazing, everything they do they do well, and they have absolute standouts as well. I would absolutely recommend talking to the waiter and getting his/her recs though. Their entire restaurant is GORGEOUS. *GORGEOUS*. The seating is exquisite and comfy. We went early enough that they allowed us to take the four seater table with the cushioned benches. The bar is beautiful and have nice seats if you want to go early and lounge. The bar menu is extensive for those who want to drink., New restaurant in Washington Harbour...highly recommend giving it a shot. The fresh fish was amazing (we had dover sole). Place is new and service was just so so...I hope to go back and upgrade my ratings., We enjoyed our brunch today and service was good, the waiter overdid it a bit with his properness, however he was nice. Food was good, most prices were in line with expectations. Some were a little expensive. The lobster roll was very tasty, however at 22 dollars on the high side. Interior design is well done and it a nice atmosphere along the Potomac. We will go back..., Really perfect all around.Decor: warm, upscale, in, romantic, but also has an air of power player.Menu and fare: I wanted to try everything but having just had a baby, started with oysters (Washington, Cape Cod and Duxbury) that were distinct, fresh, and accompanied by two sweet citrusy vinegars that I wanted to drink in with a straw! Main course was a delicious seafood stew over creamy polenta -- to die for -- as was my husband lobster ravioli with ginger butter. Desserts were also a hit--a lemon meringue torte and a dense chocolate mint and pistachio cake. Service: attentive, personal but not too in our faces. Fiola Mare is lovely and worth the priciness, especially if you can watch Chef Fabio conduct the symphony of staff and cuisine with a very serious attention to detail and timing., This is another amazing Fiola restaurant on the Georgetown waterfront, when the weather is warmer its going to have an amazing open patio overlooking the river. I enjoyed a savory pasta and scallop dish with the perfect bottle of Italian white wine. There is also a lovely room for events that seats about 15 people. Make you reservations now otherwise you will miss out!, This was just so perfect, Im hesitant to describe it too much because I wont do it justice. Just take the 5 star review, all your money, and go. This is such a cool location on the Georgetown waterfront, but away from the main drag and all the summer drunks. They really did it justice with the buildout. It feels very open and simple but still upscale. I cant wait to sit on the patio once the weather is nice.The service was fantastic. As you expect from a place like this, I must have gone through 10 silverware setups and the table was wiped down between courses, but thats really not what made the service special. It was the ease with which our server (and the entire team that worked with her) let herself into our meal just enough to be pleasant and upbeat and beyond knowledgeable, but made it not about her or her personality or her script. She let the food do the talking, and talk it did. I had just about everything on the menu... Thats not an exaggeration, we were at the chefs table and had course after course of deliciousness. I can say without equivocation that there was not a single sub-par dish, but more than that, everything was inventive and fresh and just top notch. This is a chef who knows about acid. I wont go through everything but do have a few highlights. Order the frutti di mare... their seafood is fresh and flavorful and at a place like this, how can you not get the sampler platter?!I would order the hamachi every single time I come here. It was that good. Fresh, unexpected and really a perfect bite, but if youre not into a super fishy taste just eat it without the roe. The same with the burrata salad. WOW. I have never never had burrata this good outside of Italy and it paired perfectly with the cucumber salad and all the other goodness in that bowl. Id come back for dinner at the bar and just order that and a glass of wine... but that would be a mistake because everything else is just so fantastic. The pasta is what youd expect from Fabio Trabbochi. In a word: perfect. The actual pasta really stands out - the dishes are perfectly sauced. Order the Lobster Ravioli and any of the other pastas. Id eat the cavatelli every night if I could. They fillet the fish right at your table. The chef and the servers are happy to suggest which to order. I loved the dorade and black cod. Save room, if at all possible, for the bomboloni, which are powdered ricotta donut holes, and the rum cake. If you have to choose one, the rum cake is the winner. Spumoni was fabulous too and if i were coming back in the summer, that would be my one thing Id order for dessert., I want to give Fiola Mare the five stars it deserves, but our experience fell short. The food was flawless -- lobster ravioli and the risotto were wonderful and well-worth the $30-$35 pricetags. However, the service fell very flat. We went through several servers, none of which seemed to warm him or herself up to us, so we didnt even know who we ended up tipping. We were also overcharged for our dinner bill -- our servers didnt communicate the two drinks we had at the bar while waiting for our table had already been paid for. The admin staff was easy to work with regarding resolving this problem.Truly a wonderful experience especially on a sunny, warm day, but beware of slow service and overcharges., Absolutely amazing. The location is perfect. The magnificent views of the Georgetown waterfront and the Kennedy Center in the background give this restaurant a elegant ambiance. The service was simply perfect. The staff were friendly, sincere, and very professional. And the food was delicious. The Colors of the Garden Salad was very tasty and refreshing. The Dorade whole fish was just fantastic. We had the Torta al Limone for dessert which ended a perfect night. I am very stingy with giving 5 stars on Yelp but Fiola Mare definitely has earned every star., About time to have a nice restaurant on the waterfront. The food was fantastic special the Lobster Ravioli but the portions for the price was very small. After paying about $500 for dinner, my friend left the restaurant complaining that after having salad, main course(fish) and dessert, she was kind of hungry., Made reservations from 3 weeks before they opened up on Open Table. Specified that it was a dear friends birthday. We were seated 20 minutes late because they wouldnt give us the table we wanted. They said that it was reserved, meanwhile no one was sitting there. Also they specified they can only take requests but not guarantee it. Make that kind of exception for your guests not a good way to start. They did try to please us after 20 minutes wait. Gave us a table for 4 and cramped 5 of us on it. Service is slow. We sat for another 15 minutes before wine and bread came along. We paid $600 for 5 people and couple of us left hungry. A restaurant with a great location and breath taking view, so if money is not an issue go there but request a table with water view because you just might get it if you are lucky and you know the owner. :), It just didnt live up to expectations for a $$$$ restaurant. Service was very SLOW. Two hours for one round of cocktails, oysters, a prosecco sorbet amuse busche, pasta entrees, and dessert. To their credit, dessert was gratis for the slow service.Highlight of the meal was my husbands scallop and ravioli in a foie gras sauce. Yum! Bread was never served, but we ended up asking for it to soak up that sauce.The staff wasnt terribly familiar with the three types of oysters available that evening, stating that they change nightly. Bummer, considering we dropped nearly $60 on oysters. It made me miss Farrallon, San Francisco, another high end seafood restaurant that has done a much better job recommending oysters from a selection of about 10.If youre looking to not drop a crazy amount of $$$$, avoid the cocktails. They come in very small martini glasses for $14. You may be better off getting a glass of wine instead. Also, valet is $20. We parked ourselves in the garage for $12; the restaurant doesnt validate.Bottom line: not a bad place for a super special date night or to hob knob with DCs elite. Could have sworn I saw a Supreme Court Justice dining there. We should have come before our 7:30 seating for a better view of the Potomac. Overall quality of the food was disappointing for the price., OH. MY. GOD.This place is where my food dreams become reality. Came here last Saturday for dinner with my roommate and her mother to celebrate Mothers Day a little early. We did not have a reservation but the hostesses were very gracious and seated us right away outside with a view overlooking the waterfront. A+ for location. NOTE: We came around 6 PM. Very early.This place is best described as Fancy (with a capital F) Italian seafood fusion. The chef is very creative because each dish is a combination of such exquisite flavors and AMAZING presentation. Our waiter was VERY attentive- A+ for service.This isnt your average restaurant- be warned, this place is VERY pricey. But I consider myself a foodie, and I would be willing to pay the hefty sum for dinner again. The three of us split two appetizers (each priced around $24). We also ordered a delicious bottle of wine.The waiter sold us on the monkfish liver.... I know what youre thinking... I am not a fan of liver but the way this dish tasted and was presented made me a believer. The dish was presented with flower garnishes and was seasoned with passion fruit seeds, strawberries, and salmon fish eggs (these are my favorite). The combination of flavors burst in my mouth - it was absolutely amazing.We also ordered the tuna carpaccio, which was served with a labna and finely chopped cucumbers (think tzatziki) and olives filled with capers. The fish melted in my mouth and the combination of flavors were sublime.We each ordered a pasta dish ($30-$39): lobster ravioli, gnocchi, and prawn bucatini with sea urchin. Each dish was presented beautifully and tasted delicious. A+ for taste, A+ for presentation.We splurged and got the bomboloni for dessert ($13)- they are doughnut holes made with ricotta and covered with sugar, served with hazelnut chocolate sauce, and vanilla ice cream. A little overindulgent but a must try.As you can tell, I am gushing over this place.. and making myself really hungry while writing this review. I ate there on Saturday and can still recite everything I had a couple days later. I would definitely come back.. probably for a special occasion., Celebrated my birthday here. Good seafood and service was excellent! Great location as well! Hope theyll stay consistent in quality., This is a new resturant about 10 weeks old. We went to celebrate another one of my sisters accomplishments. Somehow I end up paying for her accomplishments. It is justifiably an expensive place. Like everyone says, it has great ambiance and hint of power play. We saw AOL co-founder Steve Case dinning a few tables away.Lets start with wine. Their sommelier - Jennifer used to work at the Little Inn at Washington she not only remembered my sister but also the type of wine she likes. She recommended Valdez Lancel. It had a great finish.Now for the food. We got the frutti di mare. It was good the small portion works for 4 people. The sea weed salad and tuna tartare were very good but the prawns were one of the best I have had. It was better than the lobster. Their Hamachi sashimi was good but I liked the snapper sashimi, the fennel seeds made the difference.We also tried the lobster ravioli the sauce was thick and savory. The ravioli was better than the lobster. I think the Gnocchi was the best dish. It has the right mixture of seafood, cheese and potatoes. The sauce was similar to the lobster ravioli but different enough to stand out as the glue that got all the ingredients together. For desert, the Spumoni was an interesting dish. It was light and airy the foam was refreshing. My favorite was vanilla ice cream with house limoncello. It is not on the menu but it is a great way to end the evening. The house limoncello is thicker so it has more sugar in it. We had a 4 hour meal and after a couple of bottles of wine, I really did not care about the calories. However pour only a little of the limoncello otherwise the sweet and tart will overpower the dish. Give the remaining high calorie drink to your over achiever sister, if you are lucky enough to have one., Beautiful restaurant with a great view of the water and its the perfect spot to people watch. On the other hand, food and service was lacking from my experience. A few girlfriends and I came for lunch a few weekends ago and was seated outside. The server took a while to come and greet us which could have been forgiven at first occurrence but it happened the entire time. My friend ordered an appetizer and had barely finished speaking before the server turned around and left without asking anyone else what we wanted. It didnt seem very busy to me as it was during early dinner hours and we were all baffled as to why our server rarely came to our table. The seafood were all fresh in my opinion although most dishes we ordered were a little disappointing. The batter on the calamari appetizer was a little soggy and falling apart. One friend and I each ordered the squid ink risotto and we both couldnt finish it as we found it extremely salty. We grew up eating seafood in a tropical country therefore, we are very familiar with squid dishes. Two other friends each ordered the clam spaghetti which they both said was even saltier than the squid risotto, after having a taste of both dishes. They did however finish most their spaghetti. The highlight of the meal was the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio which we all agreed was simply delicious, there was not a crumb left on the plate.Considering the ambiance, location and prices I was definitely expecting better service and better food. I wouldnt mind coming back for a special occasion but will try new dishes., Impeccable service, stunning decor, nautical feeling, sophisticated, a place to see and be seen. The food is exquisite, the wine list detailed. Ive had dinner and Brunch. Unexpected, but the brunch is a must do for the lemon marscopone pancakes and the aged maple syrup, paired with a peach Bellini. The lump crab melts in your mouth, the breads are just as yummy, and the pastries a must have., Phenomenal food. Great waiter whose daughters name is also Bella ! We not only were treated to fresh exquisitely cooked seafood, but the great service and waterfront location completed our early sunset dinner. It is not in the budget for everyone. Food created like Fabio Trabocchis plates cannot be mistaken for anything but the best. Not in the same class as other places down the boardwalk. But this is DC and I am happy to see all levels of great cuisine pop up in the great DC neighbourhoods. My uncle has lived in Ancona for 35 years....going there as a child and as an adult, the food, the ingredients and the cooking is just to die for. It all came to completion when I read Mr. Trabocchis bio learning his roots are in the best region of seafood and culinary excellence ! Bravo!, 2 words - Food PoisoningThey did respond to my call and ran an investigation but then told me that I was wrong and didn get sick from their food. I am sure it was from this dinner (I will spare you the details) and am disappointed in the response as well as the illness., Service was so poor! If we are paying big bucks to have good food, we also deserve some good service. Also, the food was bland, the steak was not done well. Total waste of money., Woooooooooooooow!! Went there with my husband to celebrate my Birthday. We had a wonderful experience there. The food is delicious and the gelato with olive oil was excellent. Cant wait to be back! (Service is great), We came here with 35-40 minutes to spare, intending to have a couple drinks and some oysters while waiting for a boat departure. Ten minutes passed before we were greeted by our server. We ordered drinks; my prosecco came first and five more minutes passed before my companions cocktail arrived. I would have preferred that they came out at the same time so we could have toasted... but the bubbles were fast disappearing. We decided that at this rate we wouldnt have time to order food (even raw food!) or another drink, so we paid the tab and left. Our server came across as apathetic rather than busy. The outdoor section was half empty at that time. I would love to return for the food when time is not an issue... and hopefully better service. Note: my husbands cocktail, the Spring Garden was delicious. Fresh tasting with cucumber overtones., Oh Fiola Mare I wanted to love you...I really did. And I did love the location, atmosphere and service. But your food let me down. Bread with no butter and rubbery lobster ravioli arent my thing. If youre a tourist- sure check this place out. If not, go somewhere else!, I honestly don know why this restaurant has such a high rating. My boyfriend is a food connoisseur and he wasn impressed at the slightest- me being from New York neither was I. I would have been happier going to Olive Garden... A $150.00 meal for two is fine if it worth $150.00. Our portions were small- if you plan to attended make sure youe aware it snack sized portions-- we were still hungry after having: a appetizer, meal and dessert. The staff was super rude and unfriendly. I went to go use the restroom and the gentleman tried to stop me, just because I was in hiking clothes and wasn decked out. Note on the website it doesn say what attire to wear. I was appalled at the lack of respect- no human being should ever be treated in such a manner. I was not impressed and I will definitely not be back. I do not appreciate being profiled., I was really excited to try this place, esp since we had a great experience at the original Fiola and because of the rave reviews here on Yelp. I have been looking for a good seafood restaurant in DC, as I miss all of the amazing seafood that I took for granted while living on the west coast. I have to say that this entire experience was disappointing and a let down. The restaurant is beautiful, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, the caliber of the food and service did not match the decor. For starters, we were led to our table by a sassy bossy host with an attitude... not a good way to set the toneWe were seated at a window overlooking the Potomac, but our view was primarily of hoards of tourists lining up to get on and off the boats. We went for brunch, and we tried:-Hamachi sashimi: portions very small. It had a fresh presentation, but it wasnt memorable-Shrimp and grits: I love shellfish and seafood. But this dish had an overpowering flavor profile (sausage maybe?) and the actual shells from the shrimp. It reminded me a lot of a shrimp and grits dish at Vidalia yrs ago. Only to find out later that the head chef at Mare happens to be from Vidalia. -Bucatini with shrimp and uni: pasta prepared well, and the uni made for a nice rich sauce. This dish was probably the redeeming grace of our meal at Fiola Mare-Panna cotta: We ordered this based on our servers recommendation. It was good, but again -- not too memorable. Our server seemed a bit robotic and detached. He tried to make an effort to engage with us, but he just didnt exude a natural warmth about him which made the whole experience awkward. With an unfavorable staff, over-rated food, and a location that is very touristy, the atmosphere here is strange and uninviting. Darn, I really wanted to like this place., I normally dont write reviews very easily...........But this time I had to. I would give this place 6 stars if possible. I went there last Friday for my girlfriends Birthday. The food was outstanding, the service even more so..............Gaspare, our server was maybe the best and the most professional server I ever dealt with. Actually he acted more like a friend than a server.I will be back and I recommend this Fiola Mare hands down!, Absolutely fantastic meal from start to finish. We had cocktails at the bar with Charles (Moscow mule was perfect) while we waited for our table. The hostess could have been a bit more friendly because I felt like I was disturbing her when we asked about how much longer it would be for our table. When we did get seated our waiter was quiet and efficient (just the way fine dining should be). We had a few different dishes but the sea urchin pasta and the Bronzino really stood out. My boyfriend is a chef and was waiting to see how perfectly our waiter filleted it and kudos to him because it was perfection. Great place for date night!, 4.51 rounded up to 5. The setting, locale and ambiance are first rate. I had the grilled calamari and it was spectacular. Tried a multitude of desserts and all were fantastic. Fiola Mare is on my DC recommended list., My fianc39e and I decided to hit this gem by the water on a Monday evening - perfect day of the week to check it out rather than fighting for a 9pm reservation on a weekend night.We arrived at 7pm and surprisingly, the inside dining room was packed! We sat in the outdoor patio overlooking the patio. It was actually perfect. First impressions - waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and what to recommend. He started off my offering their special cocktail - a frozen negroni. He sold me after he explained it and it was super yummy, perfect for a hot summer night. Second first impressions - the prices are indeed steep. I expected this beforehand after reading the yelp reviews. We ended up getting the Lobster Ravioli and the Cod. I am always hesitant to order pasta dishes, especially those of the $40 variety. But, the yelp reviews touted the ravioli and the waiter emphasized that this was Chef Fabios signature dish...when in Rome! The cod was fantastic. A really fresh fish that just melted in my mouth. It came with a nice clarified butter/leak sauce. The ravioli, on the other hand, had 3-4 pieces of ravioli but, the pasta was homemade, and the stuffing was crab/lobster and the lobster pieces that came with ravioli were large, fresh and had great texture. The portions were a bit on the small side, but again, I kind of expected it.All in all I was pleased. I wasnt blown away yet I think because the portions/ravioli didnt quite live up to the price. Will definitely try again for the indoor ambience and the bar!, Great food, great atmosphere, pricey., The food was good, great even. We got oysters as an appetizer followed by two $30 pastas. I got spaghetti with clams and my fiancee ordered risotto. The seafood was very fresh and both dishes well put together. Wines while expensive by the glass ($18 no less) came in huge glasses and were probably 1.5 wine glass. The cocktails were very good. The reason why I wasnt truly impressed is because the service was horrible. When we arrived at the restaurant they were completely booked for the night, though literally half the restaurant was empty. Fortunately, we had a reservation but between them taking us to different tables all of which were certainly a terrible choice compared to some that were available (but apparently reserved and never taken) we spent 30 minutes waiting for the hostess to sit us. Two different hostesses forgot about us twice. The ambiance is interesting, the place is full of older men scouting for younger women and older fabulous DC housewives that are social lights walking back and forth with their friends to see the chef, wave at him and call him over to their table. Will I go back? We paid about $100 each which was a hefty price for the food/service we got. I can think of a couple of places here in DC where Id spend that much on food before coming here. Though I have not seen a seafood place in DC that is as good/fresh as this. Maybe once the hype dies down and they simmer down with showing off Ill be coming back., Meh. One and done. Went last night to see what the fuss was. Nothing to get excited about. Not coming back. Food is good, not wow and price adjusted its definitely not worth it. Physically its very pretty. Nice views of the water for many seats (maybe half). Very good staff. Food comes quickly. Almost too quick. Done in about 45 minutes and had to stretch it out over dessert a bit. Food was good but not great. Seafood was fresh. But it came out like any fresh seafood would taste. Not really much better than I can do at home if I hit the fresh seafood market first. My scallops taste exactly the same as the ones we had here. The salad - colors of the garden - was the best part of the meal. Nice mixture of unusual greens and a unique dressing. We split the dish and it turned out to be plenty. No reason to spend $18 each for a salad. Which by the way was an insane price but we knew that coming in. Wife had Under The Sea. Good sized portion of mixed seafood. Well cooked but no real seasoning or treatment for the seafood, until... Until they pour over the salty porky tasting broth that ruined the dish. I suppose if you are cattle and appreciate a good salt lick this is for you. As for people reserve the broth to the side until you make up your own mind. I had Lobster Ravioli. Good. Not wow. Raviolis seemed a bit more wonton like in shape (bag like) rather than a traditional Italian flatter style. Stuffed ok per ravioli. Downside? You get 3. Thats it. 3 for $40. One claw and half a tail in the sauce. Sauce was good but nothing you cant get for elsewhere. Not to die for.Bellini was not as good as the one you can get at Brios. Dessert doughnuts werent superior to your better churros!Spent much of the meal reminiscing about our last great meal at Inn at Little Washington. Then grabbed a cheeseburger on the way home to make up for the relative lack of food. Doesnt that just say it all!PS valet parking is only $15 so not too bad depending on how you tip. Reasonably open for a Friday night. You definitely could walk in and get a non view table. Not hard to get into like Le Diplomat which is next on the list., If I could afford to come here more, I would.I not sure why I left feeling like it was overpriced. Service: uh.maze.ing Some friends and i had a lil brunch here and they seated all of us (at the time of rezzie 10) in a back room with a great view of the water and had several waiters that seemed like they were only there for us (they weren, but they were so attentive and knowledgeable without being intrusive, it just felt like that, until I saw them serving another table nearby). When 2 folks didn show up, they graciously removed the places without protest or attitude. They walked through the menu with us, made some great recommendations, and didn push or pedal dishes people didn want. Oh and at the end, they were like we knew this was to celebrate something but we didn know what, so we brought this to you with a chocolate mousse and a candle. It was...well, sumptuous. Food: um. awesome. All said and done, folks had: --bread basket: um. insane. homemade pastries, breads, etc. Several of my Euro friends said it was the best bread theye had in the states. I shouldn eat it so I only tried a bite of 2 types and they were phenomenal. At 18 bucks though, it better be. That still seems steep...even though I know how theye all made and you have to pay me a lot more to do the work it takes to make those for you... --grilled fish: Some friends had the arctic char and snapper; all perfectly seasoned, incredibly luscious. They didn eat the skin so I did--it the best part! The skin was perfectly fried--so crispy and amazing and rich in nutrition. I basically felt my hair, skin, and nails getting stronger, glossier, and more fabulous with each crunchy taste. --shrimp n grits: soft polenta and 3 giant prawns. I and another friend had these. Wowzahs. This is the fanciest shrimp n grits this southern gal has ever tasted. While rich and decadent, this dish didn leave us feeling overly stuffed, delightful. --Bistecca y uova: steak and a giant duck egg, perfectly poached in olive oil. I tasted my friend and wanted to swan dive into the parmigiano crema which is laced with hearty mushrooms.  --Cavatelli: So good my friend wouldn let the rest of us taste it. I not kidding... --Ahi Tuna Carpaccio: One of the prettiest presentations Ie ever been served. It was beautiful, it was tasty. We all loved it--even the people weirded out by raw food. --Crabcake: Again, bein gluten-free, I didn really taste it, but it was a huge portion and folks were raving about it. --Generally i skip dessert but you be stupid to not get some of the gelatos/sorbets. We tried the pistachio and chocolate gelatos. These were not your typical. They were stunning. The sorbets were coconut and passionfruit. Wow, so much flavor.  Drinks: Ok, these are ridiculously priced. Theye also ridiculously good. I wanted more. I didn because I was already breaking my bank account. We tried many of the mixed drinks, every single one of them was well balanced, flavorful, and beautifully presented.If youe like me, you won be goin here often. But each time you do, itl be memorable., Make a reservation to sit near the water, the waterfront steals the show in this location. They did well :) The food doesnt even need to be discussed because its so wonderful that you simply cannot go wrong with any dish you order. The inside space is beautiful as well, from the light fixtures, to the way that the tables are spread out. You can absolutely visualize bringing a simple date here, or a larger group of friends, theres no thought that you cant do it all in this place no matter what section of the restaurant you end up sitting in., Great location, the staff seemed very friendly and spoke and smiled whenever I walked by. I just had a quick snack with my gf, we had the grilled calamari. It was fantastic! I will definitely be back for a full meal soon. The patio seemed to be the place to sit on a nice night., This place is all about sea food. The prices are very high but so is the quality of the food. Unfortunately, most of the fish featured are imported from abroad (e.g. NZ) and are not fresh but frozen. The offerings of local fresh fish is limited. Grilled swordfish (Virginia) was very good as was the crab cake. I know I can grill swordfish as well as this restaurant does but i do not have access to the same quality and freshness. The rest of the menu is overpriced. Simple salad for $18 is excessive as is the bread basket for the same price. The breads are just OK - nothing special. For example, the croissant and the small baguette are distant cousins to what you get in an average french boulangerie., I wanted to give them 5 stars but the service was loopy Hats off to the chef though, excellent job!I think maybe since we sat in the bar area seating we had a barback. He was sweet though, tried. Oysters were very good, not amazing but quite good. not exactly sure what I got since they were different from menu. Cocktails were nice. Salad excellent, basic salad but quite interesting. We had seafood that was very good but not memorable. Gnocchi was divine. even if it ended up being our dessert. Overall I rate it a 4 star due to the clear high quality ingredients and the lovely romantic setting. Our service was off but really nice, and he did give us two glasses of nice wine for - well just a series of mishaps.****FIOLA MARE _ I WILL NOT REDUCE YOUR RATING BUT YOU NEED TO TALK WITH THE HAIRY FACED RED?BROWNISH HAIRED VALET THAT SPED INTO THE LOT TODAY NEARLY KILLING MY MOTHER. NO APOLOGIES, MISSED HER BY TWO INCHES. WHAT AN IDIOT! 12/14/14, This restaurant was beautiful, inside and out! My boyfriend and I were in Georgetown Sunday afternoon over 4th of July weekend, looking for a place to eat on the waterfront. We had our dog with us, and many of the restaurants on the water do not allow dogs any longer due to their new insurance policies. We thought we were out of luck for waterfront dining, when we came upon Fiola Mare. It was a little pricier than we were planning, but since we had the dog, we didnt have many choices. This was a blessing in disguise since it gave us the opportunity to try this hospitable & delicious Georgetown treat! First of all, the staff were so friendly and not uptight at all about accommodating our little four pound yorkipoo. They searched high and low for a water dish for her. The staff was so friendly, someone even escorted us to the bathroom inside when we asked where the restrooms were! We were there around 3:00, between lunch & dinner, so they were serving a somewhat limited menu, but we still found plenty to try. My boyfriend asked that they make sure to not provide small, flabby oysters when he ordered the oysters on the half shell (we have had some bad experiences in the area with restaurants serving the teeniest of oysters), so the gentleman who brought them out made sure to explain that they did their best in selecting the largest, plumpest oysters for us, which we appreciated. Im not a fan of oysters, but I wanted to try one after the gent explained the sauces they served with them, and it was really good! We ordered the fried calamari, which was unique in that it was long, wide strips of squid, not the small, rings you usually get. They were really tasty & so was the aioli served alongside for dipping. We also got the lobster roll, which had the perfect amount of slightly spicy mayo coating plump chunks of lobster meat, on the lightly toasted buttered roll - perfection! We added some of the lettuces from the small salad provided alongside, which added a nice little crunch. We got the three cheese plate and all of the cheeses were so flavorful and interesting. The honey & cherries they served with the cheese were the perfect accompaniment. Amazing food, very friendly/eager to please/happy service, and lovely location made for a great, five star dining experience. I cant wait to go back (without the dog!) to try the full dinner menu., great service, good food. worth the price? no. a strange guy stands outside the entrance, sort of like a doorman, who asks, can I help you? what if he can? Does he tell you to go back to Capitol hill? A little odd, and off-putting. this isn club 54, folks., This ranks, hands down, among the top 5% of dining experiences weve had in the last two years here in DC (and tops more expensive and upscale options like Marcels). Its pricey, but absolutely value for dollar. The service was impeccable, and the food was perfect., This is a bias and not a customer service oriented restaurant. Being Asians, the guard of this restaurant stopped me and my friends on 2 different days, to go inside this restaurant. First time, when I went with a friend, the guard stopped us to enter the restaurant and asked us why we were going to the restaurant. I was shocked and asked him what he meant by that. He said, what was our purpose to go inside the restaurant: drinking, food or....This is ridiculous that we had to explain to the guard why we were going inside this bias restaurant. This has never happened before to me when I had to explain my purpose of going inside a resturant.Another day, when I tried to inside this restaurant with a different friend, the guard stopped us again, by telling us there is a private party inside and we couldnt enter the restaurant. If the restaurant is such big and has a huge bar, why 2 people cannot go inside the bar. And I could see empty seats in the bar. But, the guard didnt allow us to go inside. I and my friend were pissed off and went to the other restaurant at the harbor called Nicks Riverside Grill where we received great customer service and no one questioned/asked us our purpose to go inside the restaurant.I and my friends can never imagine going to Fiola Mare again after receiving such bias and rude treatment by the guard and bad customer service by this restaurant. Glad there are other good restaurants around that dont treat customers this bias and rude based on their race., My husband and I came here 2 weeks ago to celebrate my birthday. It was our first visit. My husband was coming from work, so I enjoyed a Spring Garden cocktail at the bar while waiting. It was a great drink and reminded me of a course I had at Minibar called spring thaw.We are huge fans of Fabio Trabocchi. His attention to detail is evident when you enter one of his restaurants. At Fiola Mare, I first noticed the service staff uniforms, which I loved. Even the check presenters had hand-stitched leather. All of these details are nice, but don really matter if the food isn good. The food isn good here, it amazing!I was avoiding gluten temporarily for 2 weeks, and our server confidently directed me towards safe options. I started with the burrata, which was great. Unfortunately, it came out with a bread crisp of some sort on top which I couldn have, but this was a the only off thing that happened during our visit. The dish was delicious, and my husband enjoyed the tuna carpaccio to start.For dinner, we split the lobster ravioli and the under the sea special. The mixed seafood plate was delicious, but the star was the lobster ravioli, which our server said would remind us of Maestro. We were not disappointed. We were able to enjoy it with gluten-free pasta. For dessert, my husband had the bomboloni, (donuts), which he said were superb. I had the Marchesi chocolate terrine with mint and pistachio.I noticed there were edible flowers on several dishes, including my cocktail. Seems to be a thing here.Now that wee enjoyed both Fiola and Fiola Mare, we hope to try Casa Luca next.We really miss Maestro! We loved everything about it, but are glad he returned to the DC area so we can experience his lobster ravioli again., Food was incredible and service was great. Had one of the best meals Ive had in years. I would recommend this restaurant to any foodie., Exquisite, extremely balanced dishes and Johanna was a superior server. Thanks., A great place if you want to impress a date by spending a lot of money for very little food that doesn match the description from the waitstaff.I was visiting the area and meeting a friend at the Waterfront. When I pulled in there was valet parking that was $15 if you were going to Fiola Mare or $40 if you were not. It looked good so I decided to valet park and try it out.My friend had the Giant Madagasgar Salt Prawn (notice the singular), and I had the Under The Sea which was described as a large plate with a large assortment of seafood on a bed of quinoa. I specifically do not like a lot of sauce and didn want a variation of a Cioppino. What I received was a bowl with very little seafood (2 muscles, 1 small shimp, 1/2 a tiny langoustino, a very small square of fish, and a small square of foise gras) in a bowl to which the server started pouring a broth base.The food was tasty but insanely overpriced for the tiny amount of food that we received. My friend, a very petite woman, commented that everything on the menu must have been appetizers. This meal with 2 cocktails cost $152.90 not counting the gratuity.After having dinner we decided to go to another restaurant to have another drink and get some more food. When we returned, the restaurant was closing and the valet was gone. I asked the person in the restaurant where the keys to my car were and she told me that the valet left them with the person working in the parking garage. When we went to the garage the person there did not have my keys. I went back to the restaurant to find that everyone had left. Walking around, I found the valet stand and decided to look through it and found my car keys in the only drawer in the stand where anyone could have easily retrieved them.Because I had paid the valet, I did not have a ticket for the parking garage. When I tried to get out of the garage the attendant made me get another ticket as a Lost Ticket to which I had to pay another $20 just to get my car out.I can easily say that I have no intention of going to this restaurant ever again. There are too many other places in the area with outdoor seating and views to need to put up with this kind of service again., Rarely does the valet enter into the conversation unless there was a bad experience. In fact this was the beginning of an exceptional evening. We were greeted by 2 fellows one of whom opened my (drivers) door, anticipated my jacket in the back seat and held it for me to adorn. From that point an absolutely sparkling young woman welcomed us inside and showed us to our table. Our waiter, whose name I will retrieve and add in an edit later, was superbly professional, friendy, knowkledgeable and confident and an intergral part of our exceptional experience. Our party of 4 unanimously agreed that each and every creation was a delightful culinary event!Thoroughly wonderful evening!!, Il start by saying Ie never written a bad review for a restaurant on yelp, but the poor treatment at Fiola Mare compelled me to do so. It was absolutely atrocious. Their General Manager, John Gilbert, posed as the sommelier and recommended a few bad bottles of wine. He eventually handed the reins over to the actual sommelier after we sent a bottle back. That was embarrassing for us since nobody in our group had done that before. The other sommelier did a nice job.It wasn until the end of the meal that we find out we had been charged for a $500 bottle of wine we didn consumer let alone order. Gilbert was very rude and effectively told us we would be paying for it, Ie made my decision. We asked him to produce the $500 bottle and he could not. Several waiters and staff informed us of his terrible reputation around town. This is where the story gets ridiculous. He brought their bouncers over to threaten us and escort us out after we paid. Ie never been to a nice restaurant that required bouncers. It was very theatrical. Since that dinner, July 18th, we have spoken to the owner and contacted our credit card company to alert them of the fraudulent charges. We told John Gilbert we would not be tipping and that his waiter would suffer because of the way we were treated. He said wel take care of our waiters. He certainly doesn care about his customers. In addition, I like to add I was on a father-son trip. Myself and two of my close friends were just trying to enjoy a nice dinner with our fathers since we all rarely spend time together.If you value customer service and don want a bouncer to force you to pay your bill, I would recommend going anywhere else.The food was ok, but very overpriced for what it was. I think the other reviews will support that statement.I would expect more terrible reviews to come with John Gilbert managing this restaurant., I went there for brunch and it was simply amazing. For a fixed price you can get a drink, bread basket with fresh butter and confits, appetizer, entr39e and dessert. The bread basket came an assortment of the best breads I had ever tasted.I recommend the ahi tuna carpaccio, the broscetta dolce, the steak and duck egg and the warm tahitian cake., Absolutely wonderful. Great food and amazing atmosphere on the waterfront., My boyfriend and I visited Fiola Mare on Saturday, 7/26, for a special, celebratory dinner. We had checked reviews online and were sold immediately. We call and unfortunately we were told there were no available times and they weren taking reservations that it was first come first serve. We decided to go anyway and take a chance - thinking we could pop over to Sequoia if things didn work out. We arrived to a very helpful hostess, Madeline, who informed us that although they don take reservations there were only a few people ahead of us and if we stayed close by we be seated within an hour. We were in no hurry so we went to the bar to check it out. The bartenders were wonderful and attentive. One saw me eyeing a seat that had recently become available, he placed a glass down and set out a menu, holding a spot until I could walk around the bar. The drinks were AMAZING! I highly recommend the Spring Garden and my boyfriend exclaimed they had a nice bourbon list. To our pleasant surprise we were seated within 20 minutes (not the hr originally told) and had the best seat in the house on the patio overlooking the Potomac. The manager, Daniel, stopped by our table and was incredibly personable. We noticed he was not only friendly with us but with all tables, going as far as speaking Spanish to the table close by to the vacationers. After our meal of oysters, tagliatelle, and burrata I was full and declined dessert. Daniel wound up sending over 2 servings of gelato anyway, vanilla and burnt honey, exclaiming, you HAVE to have dessert after an Italian meal. Absolutely everything about our dinner at Fiola Mare was top notch - from the service to the food to the ambiance. We will definitely be back!, 4.5 StarsWith the demise of Citronelle, Fiola Mare is hands down Georgetown best restaurant right now, and definitely giving Cafe Milano a run for its money as the place to see and be seen. It certainly has something that Milano lacks: a waterfront view. It located in Washington Harbor complex; not in the submerged center like Fishers Farmers Bakers (no need to worry about flooding) but off to the side in the corner directly opposite Sequoia.And they do make the most of the space. There is outdoor seating overlooking the Potomac, and most of the indoor seating is oriented to give you a view of the water. There are two bars (one can be closed off and used as a private event space) and an open kitchen with fresh seafood proudly displayed on ice. Also on display the night I stopped by was chef/owner Fabio Trabocchi, who busy coordinating all of the dishes as they came out of the kitchen.But enough about the layout, the food was exquisite! Things got off to a bit of a rocky start when I ordered the Fiola Negroni; I am not a fan. It was like a slurpee and difficult to drink without a straw. But from there things improved considerably. We started our meal with the Frutti di Mari (seafood platter containing east and west coast oysters, mussels, clams, lobster, jumbo lump crab, ahi tuna tartare, head-on prawns, sea urchin, calamari salad, and jellyfish salad. This was designed for two to three people and probably could have been a meal in itself. It was very different from any plateau de fruits de mer Ie ever had; in addition to the unusual assortment, it had a very Japanese/Asian influence to it (as did much of the other food) particularly the jellyfish salad with the noticeable flavor of sesame oil. It would not have been out of place as an otsumami at a Japanese izakaya.For my main I had the incredibly rich bucatini with prawns, sea urchin, and espelette chilis (pastas comes in full or half portions). I finished it all of with a marchisi chocolate terrine for desert. The menu is actually fairly limited and changes frequently, but a constant is the large selection of fish that you can get simply grilled. For non-seafood eaters, they have Japanese wagyu steak, but you pay by the ounce, with a three ounce minimum which, rest assured, does not come cheap.As you would imagine, they have an extensive wine list and since this is a seafood place there is an emphasis on whites. Italian whites offer a better value than their red counterparts and Fiola Mare offers quite a few for under $50/bottle. We settled on a bottle of Antonucci Castelli di Jesi Riserva Verdicchio from Fabio White Collection which paired well with our seafood.We were seated promptly and service was excellent. The only discordant note was after about 9pm when they dimmed the lights and the music (lounge/house) from the the bar was annoyingly audible in the main dining room., Top 3 restaurants in DC when you combine quality of food, ambience and service. Food/Price: We split the Burrata of Buffalo Mozzarella. ($20) Amazing. Great fruit and cheese, wonderful flavours.We also ordered two of their mocktails ($14) very delicious!We both ordered the Fiola Maine Lobster Ravioli ($80). It was amazing, though I could have eaten 4 more. Fresh pasta and amazing lobster. Dont be turned off by the ginger in the ingredients, you can only taste it a little bit but it brings out the flavor of the dish. Highly recommend. All told about $140. Ambiance: Im going to upload a pic. Sitting outside you have basically a private balcony overlooking the water. Their website doesnt do a good job of showing the restaurant is positioned to take advantage of the river. We changed tables to sit outside and were grateful we did. We were lucky to eat on one of those 0% humidity 74 degrees DC summer evenings. Perfect for our anniversary. Its also elevated so you dont have tourist walking right by you as you eat and you cant smell the river. Perfect views of the kennedy center or beautiful key bridge and sunset. Service: They were perfect! They didnt talk our ears off and were very nice when we asked to move. They refilled our drinks and the food came out very quickly. Id say Komi is better in terms of food, but at Komi you just talk about the food the entire time, here you can enjoy the view, your food, and talk about something else. :)
24|fiola-washington|Im a huge fan of Fiola already. We went during their soft opening and enjoyed the experience right away. Their wine list has some of the better and more esoteric Italian grapes like Friulano and Greco di Tufo which are harder to find on many wine lists throughout the region. Skip the normal Italian wines and enjoy something different for a change.We started with the chickpea fritters, and the meal got off on the right foot. I also enjoyed the Lobster Ravioli, which was light and refreshing done in almost an asian dumpling style. But the highlight of the night was their lasagna -- deconstructed into single servings, it was almost like a veal ragu with crispy noodles and other yummy cheeses plus homemade tomato sauce. A must try for everyone.Overall, Im glad I stopped off for their soft opening and look forward to going back and trying more of their menu., Eight of us took out a colleague for a farewell luncheon. It was during the soft opening (how long do those go on, anyhow) and the noonday crowd was thin.So far things look promising. Staff was welcoming and service was exemplary, a swarming kind of approach that allowed dishes for eight to appear and disappear almost simultaneously. (It remains to be seen how they will proceed when the restaurant has filled up a bit and staff is spread a bit more thinly.) The table selected a range of entrees and all expressed satisfaction with their choices. (I chose the sea bass with asparagus as part of the well-priced $28 prix fixe menu and enjoyed it quite a bit). Something hard and inedible found its way into the guest of honors lasagna (a bit of uncooked pasta, a bone, who knows) and when informed of this, management took the entree off the bill. (We were already treating her so she ate for double-free on this occasion.) Desserts - a broad sampling of luncheon offerings (no details, didnt take notes) also garnered high marks.All in all a very nice lunch and when Im back in this neck of downtown Ill be sure to come visit again., The food was delicious, not mind-numbing, but consistently good. Out of all the food we tried (and we ate A LOT), the sliced veal, tuna tartar, lasagna, and the seafood spaghetti--were delicious!!!!! Service was excellent, decor is.... weird. Contemporary mixed with Fs floating around, brick wall, dark wall, leather menu binders, fake leaves enclosed in a translucent glass (or plastic), extremely tall (for a short Asian) and wobbly bar stools....Dont get me wrong, the restaurant is nice... I personally feel all these things are shouting at me and distracting from my meal. Go try it! You have to, at least once! I will be back for some lasagna. Yummmmm., Attention to detail is everything at Fiola by Fabbio Trabocchi! The atmosphere, aesthetics, and comfortable booths set the stage for a delightful dining experience. The bread, we learned, was a wonderful product resulting from long and creative pursuits. The pastas for those who have dined with Fabbio before (not my case; Im a newbie, soon to be a regular whenever I visit D.C.) are a wonderful if not poignant reminder of Fabbios culinary talent. I can simply say that a mushroom lasagna (forgot the very appropriate Italian name of this dish) was the kind of taste sensation that sounds your head reeling and will not soon be forgotten.We shared a delicately dressed arugula salad and a prosciutto & fresh mozzarella appetizer -- so wonderful I may make a meal of a variety of salads and appetizers next time. See what I mean; Im already thinking about the last time and it was not even 24 hours earlier!Fresh Chilean swordfish with a tasty sauce kept warm in a tableside server (with lid) was amazing. Yet I pined at our friends scrumptuous lobster ravioli and chickpea rigatoni and wondered why I did the virtuous thing by ordering fish once again. Yes, the fish was super but oh those pastas are something of the heavens.Desert is beyond mere words so Ill try to include pics--they were beautifully presented and fulfilled our tables diverse tastes so imaginatively.The servers were very attentive throughout and the chef even came out to regale us with a great story. His pride is abundantly obvious and appropriately so.The best tip I can give you is Get There soon! But when you go, since their address is 601 Pennsylvania, N.W., be advised that you must go around the corner to Indiana because its on the flip side of that building., We decided to try Fiola last night, as Ive heard great reviews. The food was OK, but nothing to warrant what I heard. The service was excellent. We had the buffalo mozarella and veal tonnato appetizers. The mozarella was incredible, but the veal was -- well, ordinary. As for mains, we had salmon and the black cod special. The salmon was OK, though raw (it was ordered medium well). The black cod was incredibly tender, but completely devoid of flavor. One additional note - the rolls, while incredibly rich and dense, are a complete fail when up against the oilve oil., So, so tasty.I had heard about this place opening up, and my boyfriend was a fan of the chefs old place in VA, so we decided to try it on a whim. Managed to get an early reservation on a Saturday night and we were so glad we did!The actual physical menu is mostly a hot mess - whoever thought putting loose floppy leather covers on it should be forced personally hot glue cardboard to the sides of each one. Its super awkward to hold. But everything we tried inside it was wonderful. Service was great - attentive and willing to answer all of our questions. We were a little confused about how to go about ordering - were the pastas intended to be main courses, or first courses? - but they were very helpful and offered to halve the pastas if we wanted to try more dishes. The bread is amazing - a salty croissant type roll. We started with the buffalo mozzarella fritter (the eggplant it comes with is heavenly) followed by a half order of the lobster ravioli. The ravioli was outstanding - I may order that as my main course next time! If you plan on sharing, definitely get a full order, as you only get a few delicious bites with the half order.For entrees, we got the veal chop and the short ribs. The short ribs were unbelievable - despite being incredibly stuffed, I was scraping every last drop of sauce off the plate! The veal chop was huge and tasty, though after trying a bite of my short ribs, I think my boyfriend wished he had ordered them too. Too stuffed for dessert, we still managed to find room for the little trio of treats they brought out, each of which was delicious. We were also pleasantly surprised at how affordable the wine was - there were a variety of tasty glasses under $10, which I feel like you never see at a nicer restaurant. It was so delicious, boyfriend went back for a work lunch recently, and gave rave reviews to the morel pasta and the ricotta donuts. All in all, I see this becoming a go-to spot for special occasions and events. Cant wait to go back!, For a restaurant of this caliber I expected a bit more from the waitstaff, but otherwise I thought everything was very good.I had stopped by here a few times -- the first time I thought about sitting at the bar but the whole bar area is not a very pleasantly laid out area, in particular the bar seating itself -- some of the tables look a bit better. Which is too bad because the bar takes up a ton of space right as you enter the restaurant. And it means the relatively small space has a bit more limited inside dining space than it might otherwise.So I didn eat at the bar. I tried to make reservations for a group over the phone later but they were all booked up.Finally I came back on my own and sat outside -- they have a very nice outdoor seating area.To this point all the staff had been very pleasant. In fact, it continued to be pleasant, just not what you expect from a 4-5 star restaurant.I was seated and given a menu but no wine list. It took awhile for the waiter to get around to me and I was pretty thirsty by this time. Then he had to go get the wine list which took a bit longer and then left again for awhile.Anyway, finally I got a nice glass of $8 italian rose, which is a pretty good deal. In fact I thought the entire menu was pretty reasonably priced for good Italian food.At this point I had been there for awhile and everyone was eating these great looking buns and I really wanted one but no one brought me one. Now I was getting pretty hungry.The waiter returned and I ordered the chickpea pappardelle pasta with mushrooms in a morel sauce. The waiter left to put in the order. Still no bread.However, my pasta literally showed up about 2 minutes later, which honestly was way too fast, which might seem like a weird thing to say, but really I just wanted to drink a bit of wine, eat one of the buns, relax for a few minutes, then get my pasta. It just felt like it was all sort of backwards and sort of like I was really being rushed. As I said, still no bread.Usually when I get a dish like this I expect to be offered (possibly) some fresh parmesan, particularly in an Italian restaurant, and (preferably) some fresh ground black pepper. Neither were offered here, and there wasn any pepper on the table.About 1/2 way into the pasta the bread came along. And it was delicious. Someone else said it was dense but mine certainly wasn, it was like a big puffy croissant with a slightly crispy exterior.And the pasta was great -- a very big serving. There were tons of mushrooms -- I would have preferred a bit more pieces of morel (I only saw about 2 tiny little bits) and less of the other mushrooms. Otherwise it was very tasty.My one bun was gone pretty quickly and no one came by to offer me another one or check and see how the food was. I really wanted another bun too.Then again it took awhile for the empty plate to go away, a dessert menu to come out and the waiter to come back to check to see if I wanted anything. I did want something originally but it took him so long to come back it started getting dark and a little chilly out, and I wasn quite so interested. Additionally, the dessert menu could use a little work describing what the dishes are -- a good poriton of the descriptions are short, partly in Italian, and generally non-descriptive to the point of being overly cryptic (chocolate with pistachio dome or something like that -- is this a cake? Is it hot? Cold? anyway...). This wouldn have been a problem if the waiter had possibly took the time to point out and describe/recommend a few when he gave me the menu (which is something I generally think a good waiter would do). Anyway, after he came back I was ready to go. Then it was more waiting for the check....Also, the menus and other items here are all made of some sort of weird thin floppy leather type item. It just feels strange. Not a big deal.However, I have a feeling the service inside is potentially better. And as I said, the food was good.I think if the service was consistent with what I expect from a restaurant like this I likely have bumped this up another star or 2. Seems like it would also be a good place to bring a group.See my pic if you like., I was hoping the poor service noted by other reviewers would have been solved. Alas, this was not the case. Bread andf water camle quickly. Initial drinks a bit slower. Main course came when we were half way through our appetizers. The bottle of wine we requested for dinner came when we were just about finished with our main courses. When we complained to the manager, our desserts got comped, which was nice and appropriate. Now, onto the good news. The food was remarkable! Everything! Nothing disappointed and the four of us are critical eaters. So go for the food. Dont hesitate! Give feedback on the serve and perhaps it will come up to par with the food and the prices., There are beautiful things to be excited about as you walk into Fiola da Fabio Trabocchi. The dark wood, the bright space, and the high ceilings evoke a sense of casual elegance. The bar greets you with an attractive wine closet set against the wall. Its a space that sets high expectations and evokes excitement. My dining companion and I were led to our table in the main dining space and set at a table for two. Ive had my share of intimate dinners in small spaces, but for all the high ceilings and dark walls that give a sense of space, the tables themselves are set so close to one another there is no privacy. There is no romance. You find yourself losing focus in your own conversation as you overhear those next to you. Your closer to the diner to left and right of you than your date. Its like a cafeteria. We asked to be moved to a more intimate space in the lounge by the bar. They accommodated quickly and with a smile. And thats a strength here. The service, the smiles, and the attentiveness. There are certainly some kinks left to be worked out among the staff--every course was brought out on the heels of the last one or before we were finished with a course (I was caught halfway in a bite of lobster when my pasta came out. I was asked if I was done and I supposed I had to be since there was only space on the table for one dish at a time)--but the effort is there. And its appreciated, although that communication between the kitchen and floor about timing is important. I certainly would have lingered over several glasses of wine and a dessert if I hadnt been forced to consume my food so quickly that I felt I was at Rays the Steaks and allowed to linger over the tender grilled octopus and spring onions or that knock out of a bread (somewhere between a croissant and a biscuit- tender, chewy, melt-in-your mouth, and salty). There is a fried cheese and squash blossom fritter that needs the acidic tomato sugo that it swims in to lighten its heavy exterior. The sugo, sweet and savory in the best way offsets the fast food feel of what is supposed to be a airy light celebration of spring and blossoms and richness. We had the burrata with roasted tomatoes and basil pesto. The cheese- not creamy like I had remembered burrata to be. Not cloudlike but more dense and stiff...as if it had seen its best day and was slowly withering into burrata death. But then saved by a wonderful dish of grilled octopus, some parts overcooked, some fork tender as you might expect from a braised-then-grilled preparation of octopus. Probably the best dish of the night. Then the signature lobster ravioli, beautiful to behold, perfect textures and aroma, overpowering ginger taste masking the sweetness of the crustacean. Finally the pastas...cooked beautifully and dressed to the nines. But then the taste. Papardelle with mushrooms? Underseasoned. Cardinal sin. Maybe they forgot to salt the pasta water or finish the sauce. The mushrooms were certainly succulent and meaty, a sign that they held their form through cooking probably expecting to be kissed at the end by the moisture pulling salt. We would have had dessert, but we were full. We had spent about an hour eating two small plates, two appetizers, and two plates of pasta. And drinking two glasses of wine. Oh such a meal needs at least twice that time to be enjoyed. I hope for a change in the timing., We went to Fiola on Friday because we had read good reviews about it and were curious about the chefs newest restaurant. Sadly, it felt like we ate at a completely different restaurant than other reviewers did. The ambiance was fine, the decorations were beautiful, and the food was horrendous.We ordered the black cod and the mushroom pasta...both were completely bland. It was almost as if they forgot to season anything! I can honestly say it was the worst food I have ever had in DC for the price. Actually, it was probably the worst weve had regardless of price. Perhaps we ordered badly? I dont know. I wont be back to find out., This place is great! The food is amazing and the service is friendly and attentive. I cant wait to go back., Bravo, Fabio - Welcome Back!A few years ago, I considered Maestro the top local restaurant for food and service and was extremely disappointed when Fabio left us for NY. But he is back! Not only is the food and service better than ever, but the decor is stylish and modern (unlike the stuffy Ritz Carlton setting for Maestro). Dined at Fiola last night with a group of friends for a birthday celebration, and they accomodated every single request with a smile. It was an absolutely wonderful experience on every level. He no longer has an open kitchen, but I spotted him peering through nicely-designed windows to check on the dining room several times and was able to say hello when he stopped by our table at the end of the night. We ordered the tasting menu (limited substitutions) and group favorites were the ahi tuna, burrata, fried squash blossoms and mozzarella, lobster ravioli, short ribs, bombollini and nutella gelato - I think every one of these dishes is available a la carte. I am now a happy (though somewhat chubbier) gal. Grazie Fabio - see you soon!, The best Italian restaurant in DC, bar none. Washingtonians have been waiting for an Italian restaurant that combines exquisite cuisine, impeccable service in a non-presumptious, but beautiful ambiance. Fiola exceeds expectations on all fronts.I will not provide a lengthly diatribe on all of the dishes our party of four sampled. This is a culinary temple. Everything was superb. The wine list provided a concise but excellent foray in to every region of wine in Italy, all of which were fairly priced. I rarely give a five star rating. If I could give six, Fiola would get one. Enjoy., How many times should someone have to call a restaurant to book a LARGE party before they give up? Once? Twice? THREE TIMES??? How about an in-person visit? And no response... nada, nein, zip, zilch, goose egg.Thus is the tale of my experience at Fiola - the hot, hip new Italian eatery captained by Uber-chic Chef Fabio Trabocchi and his spouse, Maria.I have been trying for two weeks now to book a dinner party at Fiola and cannot get as much as a return call to tell me to drop dead. My firm is getting ready to celebrate our ten year anniversary and I want to treat my staff to a fantastic evening of food, wine and fun to mark the occasion. I had dined there recently for a wine dinner and I was impressed with the service, food and ambiance, so I thought Fiola would be the perfect spot to host dinner for 30 people.After leaving three messages - count em, three - for Maria Trabocchi (the chef/owners wife and director of private dining), I decided to confront her directly. My wife and I went with another couple to Fiola for dinner last week to celebrate our 26th wedding anniversary. When we arrived, I asked the hostess to please send Maria over to the table so that I could give her a card and make the connection.Overall, the evening was a solid 8. The food was very good and both our server (ask for Ashley) and the wine director (Theo) were attentive and charming. We noticed Maria flitting about the restaurant visiting most of the tables and giving everyone the standard kiss-kiss routine. But somehow, we escaped her attention and she never as much as looked in our direction. Must have been my cologne?!?On the way out, I asked to speak to Maria. I explained who I was and that I was trying to book a dinner party for 30 - count em - 30 people. She feigned great surprise and promised (PROMISED) to give me a call on my cell phone the very next day.... And I am still waiting. Citronelle (another story) and (BLT Steak) could take a lesson from Wolfgang Pucks The Source or any of Ashok Bajajs eateries. Every single time I have been at any of these restaurants, they have made me feel welcomed and comfortable, like Norm at Cheers (you older readers will probably get that reference...). So why didnt I start with The Source (or Bibiana) for the anniversary party? Good question. And now I will..., My husband and I went there around 930pm on a weekday. As it always happens in DC, the hostess advised us to order quickly before the kitchen closes- hello? then why do you accept more people in...anyways, we order some appetizers- salad and half portion of pasta. It was delicious. I was eagerly waiting for the main dish.I ordered a veal chop and my husband had beef. Unfortunately, my dish was just OK- rather salty to compensate the lack of flavor. The beef was better than my selection but did not make it to our favorite list, besides it was medium cooked instead of medium rare as we had ordered it. I told my husband not to send it back since I will be waiting yet again (I had to send my dish when it first came, as it was rare instead of medium rare). The beef came with FRENCH fries, nothing especial really. For that price you imagine they would come up w fabulous chips, but this was not the case. We wanted some mustard and ketchup for the chips - then waiter told us: we don carry that here .. really? if you serve french fries you better have some grey poupon no? to compensate this fault, they prepared us a tomato sauce- which was delish but the rest of the dish was just mediocre... Finalment, we order a dessert- some chocolate cake w sorbet & ice cream. Maybe this was the best part of the meal besides the wine we ordered. Price for all of these $260....insanity when we coulde spent that money or less going to Tosca or Charlie Palmers..., This place is definitely on my top 10 list for delicious food, drinks, and amazing service. When we walked in we were seated right away. Our table was beautifully set to perfection. I loved the tiles on the floor. The chandeliers were gorgeous. And the rock walls and the large windows really made an impact. Our server was exceptional (*Ashley T). She is the truly the best server Ie had in a long time. We were served promptly and just after a few short moments were brought out most amazing croissant like roll. It was absolute perfection. It was not too flaky and melted in my mouth after each bite. I ordered the the Fiola which the bartender made to perfection. The Squash Blossoms &Mozzarella Fritters, Tomato Sugo Finto was mouth watering. My husband usually does not like eating cheese, but absolutely loved this dish. Ashley was also kind enough to split the appetizer so that we did not have to when it came to the table. Now that is what I call service. Knowing what we want without us even having thought to ask. The Vincisgrassi - Marche Region Classic Lasagna, Bianchetto Saucewas not only visually appealing but tasted wonderful. At the end of the meal we were pleasantly surprised with complimentary dessert. Again so delicious that we were full but could not stop ourselves from eating the this chocolate mouse type dessert with a sort of gram cracker crust. I am salivating just thinking about it. We were also brought out these small little cookie-like desserts but I can tell you that they were like no other cookie that Ie ever tasted. My compliments to the chef!, Had dinner this evening here with a group of friends. We all departed with fondly memorable experiences of cuisine from the Marche region of Italy. The lasagna was served with mushroom foam and a combination of different meats instead of a tomato-based sauce, providing it with an unforgettable richness. After the entree, we were then introduced to chef Fabio Trabocchi which was quite an honor! The kitchen then presented us with mini-macarons at the conclusion of the meal with espresso served in stylish Almodovar Illy dish ware. This restaurant is highly recommended especially to those interested in Central Italian cuisine!, Went on a Monday night with a gal pal. Bar service was great and mixologists patient as she and I were catching up. Decor is elegant and modern - restaurant was surprisingly populated for a Monday evening but not crowded. I started with the Fiola-vodka, blueberry syrup and soda. Gorgeous and delicious. Seated as we were ready. Lovely service. Ordered several apps--including memorable foie gras over a succulent sweet fig, and delicious meatballs with tomato sauce and a fried egg. Chilled melon soup compliments of the chef was a nice refreshing touch. We also had the tuna tartare which was fresh and not too heavy. I was very impressed with the wine service. Was invited to taste several wines before settling on a glass of recommended Spanish white.Dessert included a crispy chocolate hazelnut log served with accompanying petit fours. Another nice surprise touch. Definitely recommend this restaurant for a special night out!, Great service. Out waitress was exceptional.The main courses were great (maybe not a 5, more like a 4) but the service more than made up for it. Oh and so did dessert. My mouth waters just thinking of it.The drinks? 5!Main course? 4!Dessert? 5!Service? 5+!Will definitely be going back., Had a lovely dinner here last week. The decor is charming, I particularly loved the windows into the kitchen. My date had already told them it was my birthday so they brought us champagne to start! (Im not sure if they do this for everyone or just him). Extensive wine list and a really helpful, but not pushy, sommelier.We started with the slow cooked meatballs (tasty) and la burrata salad. Apparently they import their fresh burrata from Italy, and they are quite generous with it too :)Next we tried both salads - the misticanza and carciofini romana. The carciofini romana was significantly more flavorful and had huge, fresh, sweet prawns. I had the pasta special of the day, a thick fresh spaghetti with cheese (I dont remember the name) and blanketed in black truffle shavings. SO DECADENT! My date had the branzino which he didnt particularly care for - it was served in a very heavy, starchy puree, with a rich creamy sauce over top. A bit much on a warm summer night. To finish, we had a chocolate torte, which they brought out with a candle for my birthday! They also served very lovely tea cookies with our espressos.I would definitely put Fiolas on my top 5 date restaurants in DC. Be aware though that they do allow smoking on the patio (if that bothers you)., Super service and extremely thoughtful, inventive menu. A winning combination. Rachel made my birthday dinner really great, and even entertained our Napoleon Dynamite debate about when the movie was filmed vs. set in time (80s, 90s, current day parody). If you arrive early, or have to wait for your table, saddle up to the bar and sip one of Jeffs tasty concoctions. Im usually a shoe in for tasting menus, but I went a la carte opting for more meat options. We split the prosciutto antipasti that was drizzled with rich olive oil and velvetty balsamic vinegar. Definitely enough if you only want one appetizer. But of course we wanted more and got one of the specials - a crudo of a white fish (was it snapper?), uni and a red pepper sauce. Wowza. Id heard about the razor thin pappardalle ribbons and had to try them - that evenings was served with a rabbit ragu, mushrooms and rightly sauced with castelmango cheese.We split the main of a sausage topped with a single ravioli holding an egg yolk. Super, super rich but amazing. Not something I would typically order, but glad I did. One of the few dishes you wish for a smaller serving size!Definitely a place to check out. Ill be back for a few small plates at the bar, lunch, or any other time just because., This place is swanky. Everything from the cocktails to the food was stellar. This place is a hit to the wallet but proscuiotto wrapped veal chops and chesnut soup with scallops and seared foie gras are not exactly peasant food. Hope to check out lunch soon. The bar seemed like a great place to grab one..or a couple., I have been here twice for dinner and once for lunch. All have been high quality dining experiences. The dinner menu is much more extensive (and expensive) than lunch. Try the oysters with caviar as the salad course. For the main course, most of the pasta dishes can be halved, so you can try two I you want. The exception is the lasagna, which cannot be split (it is out of this world!). You wont regret getting a full order of the lobster ravioli. At lunch, many fewer options but still a good selection of pasta, seafood and meat dishes. The lasagna was an off the menu special for lunch when I was there this week.The wine list was very diverse in terms of type and price, but most of the wines are Italian, as you would expect., The food--truly outstanding. The menu is very creative, and its also quite extensive, so we barely scratched the surface our first visit. Word of caution: the hostesses have a bad habit of trying to seat people in the bar instead of the main dining room. Upon arriving last time, we (on time and appropriately dressed) were quickly ushered to a table near the bar. And on this particular night, several other groups were as well. They gave us a little attitude when we asked to move, but ultimately they were able to accommodate us without too much delay. Actually, the bar probably wouldnt be a bad place to sit, but be prepared to fight for the dining room if you want it., Hilariously bad, where to begin? The food equivalent of the designer Christmas tree or the 4 carat diamond: vulgar and tasteless. Had pasta with truffles -- covered in maybe 15 half-dollar sized slices of truffle. Brillat-Savarin called truffles the diamond of the kitchen, and I prefer understatement to bling; in a funny way there was so much truffle that you couldn taste the truffle; the pasta was OK but not outstanding. On ordering, the waiter also made a point of telling us how expensive truffles are at this time of year (truffle season) and so what a great deal the dish was. I always buy truffles because theye a bargain! (irony here American readers). Understatement seems to be a lost art, whether its the food or the service.If that not horror enough, with the first course (the waiter told us the portions were small enough to need a starter, but the starter salad could almost have been a meal, and the main course would have served a couple of people in Europe) arrived not yummy Italian bread but what could only be described as a flat-topped brioche-like roll, which was also stale! I suppressed the impulse to laugh out loud. Because nothing complements a king ransom of truffles and homemade pasta like STALE BRIOCHE served with olive oil on the side! Food for rich hicks. Or rather rich Americans. One of our party was from Kansas, and she thought it was great., Went with two friends to try the Presto $15 lunch special at the bar. Ordered two different pasta dishes and a bacon burger. Everything was delicioius. A nice treat that a glass of wine is included in the price, including a lovely cocktail special of prosecco and pear liquor., Wow...Really wow... I cannot say enough good things about our dinner experience here. The place is alive, the food was unique and out of this world. Chef Fabio and the entire staff went out of their way to make us feel like visiting royalty. We did the truffle course and the entrees included pheasant and a fish that looked like pastry when it arrived at our table, unbelievably good...Fine dining at its finest - heartily recommended..., I would give it 3.5 stars if I could. I really wanted to like this place more but it just didn do it for me ... I love Corduroy!!!!! Okay, so it a little hard to find if youe not familiar with the area. It actually in the middle of Indiana Ave. and 6th, Not so much Penn. Ave. (Their website points this out -- it a really nice website!)The decor is lovely and modern.The food was pretty yummy. The lobster ravioli has lobster in it. Real lobster! As in lobster you can see with the naked eye. Giant mouthwatering, perfectly seasoned, chunks of lobster. The lasagna was a little disappointing. I not sure if it was supposed to have been like this but the top layer of mine was a little burnt which threw off the taste of the entire thing. Portions are small. Ie never had such a cute plate of lasagna in my entire life. Ditto for the ravioli. My date looked at me and we both knew dessert wasn really an option because we were both still hungry after entrees. For dessert, I had the giudia (sp?) and my date had the affogato. I too, woulde ordered the affogato but Dolcezza has ruined me for all others. The giudia is a chocolate, and caramel, lovers dream. The only blech moment was the side of ice cream that accompanies the giudia. It some sort of sea salt ice cream. WAY too salty. Ie had sea salt ice cream at Izakaya and I rather loved it but not so much here; not at all actually. After numerous attempts to like it I ended up just eating the giudia by itself and watched a salty puddle form on my plate. For an early weekday night, this place was super loud. My date and I were practically yelling across the table at each other and still could only make out what each other was saying half of the time.Service was ... Intense. I don know what it was with the servers that night but they seriously need a dose of Ritalin. They spoke so loud, so fast, so punctuated. It gave me heart palpitations. I admittedly take a while to order because I, um, actually read the menu. Our server kept saying take your time, take your time, take your time only to re-appear every two minutes. I wanted to tell him: Slow down! Back up! Give me a minute (or five)!!! They were attentive. A little too attentive. A little stalkerish. I wasn a fan of that. Between the high noise level and the high strung service. We were more than a little relieved to exit the restaurant and walk outside into relative silence. We were seriously exhausted and needed a moment.At any rate, despite small portions, weird ice cream, and a server that favored Speedy Gonzalez; flavor was good and ambiance was nice. If youe feeling daring; do it., One of the absolute best restaurants in Washington that truly makes you want to be a regular. A cozy spot with a creative menu full of great choices. The service is on a level that is unparalleled in Washington.Truly a gem., I met friends at the bar on a weeknight for drinks and snacks and we had such a nice time that we hung around for hours. The french fries on the bar menu are fantastic. When we ordered a variety of bar snacks, I didnt think much about a $5 order of fries but they were so delicious, topped with rosemary and with some sauce, that we ordered refills every time we polished off a plate. Our servers could not have been friendlier and returned frequently to our table by the bar to take new drink and food orders. The wine selection and the cocktails are just as good as youd expect. Ill have to return at some point and actually try the dining room, but for now, Id be happy with regular visits for snacks and drinks at the tables near the bar., I was extremely excited to try this place, given some of the reviews. Unfortunately, I found the experience to be somewhat lackluster, particularly given the high prices.First, though my friend and I had reservations, we were seated in the bar area. I find that annoying - if I have a reservation then give me a real table. Even though it was the holiday week, I just would have expected better.The decor was nice, would have liked to seen more of it in the dining room rather than the bar area. The menus are made with this extremely soft, supple leather. While they feel great to touch, handling them while figuring out what to order can be somewhat challenging. I found the service to be too fast and rushed - nice waiter but it seemed like we were eating at a pace I would normally reserve for Chipotle, not a nicer restaurant. We shared the prosciutto for an appetizer - I would say it was good, but not the best I have had in a nicer Italian place. We both got a glass of red wine (I had a pinot noir). Again, the wine was decent but not worth the $14 a glass price tag. Waiter was not very informed about the wine list, another surprise given the prices. My companion had a ravioli dish with truffle. I tried it - the flavor was good (very rich). I had the caviatelli, which was nice (surprisingly spicy, which I like) but I did not feel warranted the price tag.The highlight of the meal was the dessert the bomboloni (I am probably misspelling it), which was fantastic. So many other fine place to try, I can see myself coming back here at these prices., Wonderful experience, would recommend to anyone looking for a very nice ambiance accompanied by wonderful food. The staff, especially Michael, seemed to be very knowledgeable with regard to every aspect of the menu, specials, and drinks. We sat at the bar and enjoyed a Derby and a Jolanda before the meal, and both were a very nice way to start. At the table, my wife had the Pinot Noir and I the Chianti. The Chianti was probably the worst part of the meal, as with other wines if you dont like the cheaper versions paying $12 for a glass isnt going to make you like it any more. For our meal we had the burrata, steak tartar, lobster ravioli and the short ribs. The burrata was exceptional, as you would expect of a very high quality ingredient. Steak tartar was also wonderful, and the accompanying foie gras was very nice and exhibited a steak-like quality. The egg atop it was cooked perfectly, topped with sea salt flakes. Other reviewers have done the lobster ravioli justice, however I did not expect to get as much lobster as we did, and the ravioli themselves were the best we have had in DC. Finally the short rib was also cooked wonderfully, the accompanying puree and parmesan crisp paired beautifully together. The sauce atop the short rib was a bit on the sweet side for my taste, although in no way should be described as sweet. Lastly, as we did share everything the restaurant did an excellent job of dividing it for us before it arrived at the table, and the portions were large given the style of food. We both were pushed to finish everything, I would say we both received at least 6 oz of both lobster and short rib. Including the four items, four drinks, an espresso, and a bottle of sparkling water, the tab was almost exactly $200 and left me quite satisfied., We went here for a birthday dinner, and I was pretty excited for the meal, given all the hype. We had thought we would try the 4- or 5-course tasting menu, which is not described on the website (it is also $100/$115 per person, not $80/$85 as it says on the website). The waiter let us know what the menu was for that night (giving me the impression that the tasting menu changes regularly), and we decided instead to create our own tasting menu. (Note that the menu online is not quite what is on the menu in the restaurant)We started with the prosciutto-wrapped dates and the burrata of buffalo mozzarella appetizers, which were very good. We then went with half-portions of the lobster ravioli and the duck ragu pappardelle. I wasnt a huge fan of the lobster ravioli -- it had a very nice amount of lobster, but the flavor was lost in the sauce. The duck ragu, however, was TO DIE FOR. We had a serious discussion about whether to lick the plate when people werent looking. Although we should have stopped there, we also tried the seafood stew and the tenderloin. Both were huge portions, and we just couldnt finish them. The seafood stew had a lot of seafood, but I thought it was a little bland. The tenderloin was excellent, but I was too full to really enjoy it. Because it was a birthday, we decided to go for the vanilla/chocolate gelato for dessert. Even though we were crazy full, you couldnt help but appreciate the gelato. It was excellent, with a little bit of cookie bits (??) in the gelato to give it a great texture.Overall, including wine and tip, the bill came to $250, which wasnt too bad given how much we ordered. I was disappointed with the two seafood dishes, but was pretty pleased with everything else. If I could do it again, I would just stick with the appetizers and then a full portion of the ragu. Ill probably come back, but I doubt this will be a regular place for us., Great looking restaurant inside. Food was delicious. We expected smaller servings but they actually were very good sized servings. The waiter was very good...knowledgable, helpful, and friendly. I cant imagine anyone being disappointed with this place., The food was exemplary. I definitely plan to return.The restaurant itself is noisy and your dinner probably will not be that intimate, but the food is definitely worth the visit. Portions are generous -- you are getting a meal here. I might be compelled to knock this place down 1/2 a star for the atmosphere, if I could.We went early on a Friday night -- service was very attentive and helpful, though there was an air of rushing amongst the entire staff. Courses turned around very quickly. They appeared programmed to flip tables -- this is not a place to relax and linger. Presentation is simple, but elegant.To whet the whistle, I ordered a Negroni Sbagliato which was expertly prepared. If you love cocktails, I encourage you to order one. I started with the tuna carpaccio which was quite filling in itself. I highly recommend a pasta, which was our Primi. My caccio e pepe, in all its simplicity, was unforgettable. I found the tooth of the pasta to be remarkable. My girlfriend got the same with truffles, which she was extremely excited about. My secundo was a very generous portion of lamb, featuring various cuts. I could not finish -- the waiter saw me laboring over it and volunteered to take it, which was the right move. The fresh herbs were perfectly sprinkled throughout. A guest one table over remarked his was dry, but I did not have the same experience. I will say I have had more melt-in-your-mouth lamb before. My girlfriend had turbot, stacked and drizzled with a wonderful reduction. We entertained dessert: my sorbet was very light and refreshing. I found my girlfriend chocolate pie much yummier.Both of us chose wine by the glass, my amarone was unremarkable.With four courses, we were absolutely stuffed. The meal was quite memorable, and we plan to return soon. My girlfriend is very happy to have this chef back., Food is good. Try going later in the evening, maybe they wont rush you then.Some other reviews are right -- the bus staff really rush you. Did the four course tasting menu. The staff clearing the table came by soon and often asking if you were finished, even when there was food left over on the plate. It was most annoying as I went there for the white truffle promotion and had a small piece of white truffle left over I wanted to eat during dessert (hey, why not try it out?) and the staff cleared it off. I suppose its an understandable action, but I want my $3 worth of white truffle back :)The server was very friendly and helpful though. The white truffle tasting was great. The chef chose dishes that pair well with white truffle and shaving it at the table was quite amusing.Started with a tartar with parmesan. Tartar was seasoned perfectly to be eating by itself, but combined with crumbles of cheese, a bit salty .. but still good.Second course was simple fresh pasta in a butter sauce with black truffles. Pasta was perfectly cooked.Third course was their sous vide kobe short rib. Nice dish overall. I expected more tender meat, but it was still quite nice.The server took the liberty of bringing us different desserts so we could sample both which was a great touch. Both desserts (berries & sabayon with lemon granite and lemon sorbet over short bread) was quite refreshing.So overall food was good, but service felt rushed., i had heard good things, but was utterly disappointed. this is not italian food. maybe american italian but not italian. i just spent a week in Rome and even a 15euro lunch at a random restaurant there was better than this place. the staff thinks they are a great restaurant and treats you with that type of arrogance. and then food. well two words ... salty and heavy. salty to the extend that you can only taste the salt ... and not just on one dish but all four courses we had. and the sauces are heavier than a german dish. there is definitely better italian food, and even in DC., My sister and I planned our mother 70th b-day here this past weekend., My sister made the reservation over a month in advance for a private room. Initially there was confusion about the time, but she got that straightened out and confirmed the right time and date - still a few weeks in advance. We have the e-mail string to prove so. When we arrived th night of, not only did they not have a private room for us, they did not even have our reservation!!! Imagine our embarrassment and dissapointment. After an insincere apology, (the hostess said they had it down for the following week, whatever) they said they could get the room ready for us. After a 20 minute wait, with no offer for at least a round of drinks at the bar, they sat us at a table that was in what could have been a private room, however there were four to five tables of other diners in there with us. When questioned about our private room, the hostess even had the gaul to say that this was it. Granted it could have been made into a private room excpet that it was not partioned off as it should have been!Food was okay. Presentation was nice and things looked good, but It the type of restaurant that tries to be different and mix things up just for the sake of being different, whether or not it makes sense. For instance, their lobster ravioli which does come with big chunchs of lobster is made with ginger, and I am not talking just a dash of giner, it completely overwhelmed the dish. I may be a little biased since I can stand ginger, and was not expecting it in the dish, but others that ordered the same thing and who do not have an aversion to ginger agreed. Another example, a crap dip on crostini was served cold and was smothered and what I believe was mayonnaise.My favorite thing was the popover that they serve at every table. However when my dad asked for one more, they brought him one without asking anybody else. Usually at a fine eating establishment as this one aspires to be, that would not be the case. For the most party, our party of 10 was disappointed with both their entrees and appetizers. Some were ok but on one raved. Drinks and wine list were good. Decor was nice. We have since tried to contact the manager (via e-mail) to let them know about our dissapointment about with the reservation as it really ruined the tone for the night and never heard back. Nice!, 3.5 stars.Overall it was a good meal but I dont think it was memorable.. - Complimentary bread was warm but not better than other Italian restaurants nearby. Moreover, they serve one at a time... why not basket?- Grilled mozzarella cheese sandwich with rich hearty tomato soup was good.- Gnocchi was soft and excellent. Its only that the sauce was too salty...- Dessert: sponge cake with raspberry filling and light cream with granita (shaved sorbet) was pretty interesting and lovely but it made me feel like I was having frozen cake.. Because of cold ice, all flavor didnt get blended well..- Staff was polite but for some reason, they dont seem to be attentive to details. I had to flag them down even if they were constantly walking by.. Its like a ghost walking around.Since there are many great Italian restaurants nearby Fiola, Im not sure if I would return any time soon... but perhaps for happy hour.PS: Ask for butter for your bread. Its awesome!, Very attentive service and the food is authentic and in season. Zucchini flowers with eggplant, spaghetti with crab and uni, and linguine with spring artichokes were all excellent., Felt so lucky to be back here at Fiola, my most favorite Italian restaurant in town, so soon this time. I was here only a couple of weeks ago.Even though this is a Restaurant Week, I was not really interested in any of the pasta dishes in the Restaurant Week menu selections. So I asked my server if I could substitute the pasta part with something else from their regular menu, and I told him I would not mind paying extra if it not too much. He immediately said Yes.So I decided to have Ahi Tuna Crostini (restaurant week menu), Bucatini Sea Urchin + Prawns + Mussels (regular menu), and the Fiola Chocolate (restaurant week menu). I liked everything but I especially enojoyed the bucatini pasta with sea urchin sauce. It was also a pleasant surprise to bump into my fellow Yelper friends Hue and Kelly G. there.Chef Fabio was too busy in the kitchen to come out to say Buon Giorno to me, but that is ok. I rather want him in the kitchen making sure my food is cooked right. I shall be back very soon!, I know people have been harsh on some of the reviews here....let me say that I have been following Fabio from restaurant to restaurant since Maestro.I walked in around 10pm on a Friday night and wanted to eat some cacio e pepe. I just had a hankering for it. I stop by the bar because the tables were still fully packed. So I had a Manhattan....boy what a delicious adult beverage that they make here, make sure to eat all of the cherrys at the bottom.We started the meal with the pulpo(octopus) and scallops, and the belone oysters harvested here in the states. What can I say except the octopus was perfectly tender with a little bite to it....I think the scallops could have been a little less cooked, but regardless absolutely delicious. The oyster are great and extra briny because of the granita of the oyster liqour, i think what was missing was a little caviar that they usually put on, the last time i ordered it was a plus to have it, but never the less still mighty good going down.The pastas I ordered Cacio e Pepe, Bucatini with sea urchin and Santa Barbara prawns, smoked gnocchi with fresh umbrian black truffles, and finally the delicious lasagna with an assortment of meats including chicken liver. The cacio e pepe is something that is creamy, peppery and sharp in taste this is definitely a comforting plate of pasta. Quite a good rendition! The bucatini is something straight out of a food diary in my mind, I remember the creamy taste of the sauce with the sea urchin roe folded in, and with chunks also contributing to the sauce making it incredibly sexy and luxurious. My mouth is still watering from the memory that this dish has made. The smoked gnocchi is delicious and will go back and eat this dish every single time I frequent Fiola. It has to be the black truffle! I feel like a judge that can be bought when I see the amount of black truffle covering the plate and balancing out the creamy sauce that envelops the small pillowy morsels of cloud like potato pasta! FInally the lasagna I was pretty damn full after all of that but Frank our waiter mentioned that he had not sold out of the multi layer pasta...on my last outing to Fiola I was denied the right to order the lasagna and left a empty space in my stomach that made me order that pasta even though I was completely full. I did not regret doing this at all. The sauce taste like a sunday night gravy with all the richness of a great sauce with some other interesting additions....I order this every time I go and will always order this.I ordered a panna cotta to finish off this marathon of carbohydrates. I also ordered 2 glasses of Amarone to wash all of this rich pasta down, with a negroni to finish it all off!I know this is long but if you have the means to order what ever you want and not worry about the check too much then you should come to this restaurant often and order without a care in the world. It is a little pricey and maybe this is not everyones cup of tea but well worth it and you will really appreciate the details that the chef has gone through. I love the rolls that come out but if you come after 9pm most likely youll be shit outta luck to eat them. Go run and order your food from this great restaurant....ask for Frank or Fernando to be your waiter both of these guys will take great care of you.Cheers and happy eats!, Wow. Elegant ambiance. Impeccable service. Sophisticated cuisine full of flavor. Only visit so far was lunch during Winter RW, so limited menu to sample, but very impressed. Pomodoro Tuscan Soup was hands down the best tomato soup Ie ever had. Brasato Slow-cooked Beef Short Ribs/Piemontese Style was so flavorful and delicious...absolutely mouth-watering. My dining companion Artic Char was too strong for me. My dessert of Chocolate Hazelnut Tart was a very nice finish. Mixed feelings about the La Zuppa Inglese Trifle of Raspberries, with Lemon and Basil Granita..too frozen? Not sure if the desserts, although still very good, are up to superb level of the other courses. Ginger-Basil Lemonade was refreshing and tart! Also high marks for the bread offered. Yes it is definitely pricey, but still would love to return for their dinner menu and to sample their offerings at the bar/happy hour options., What gem! This place is tucked away off of Indiana Avenue. The food was fresh and very well prepared. The variety was innovative and refreshing. The service was attentive and very polite. The decor is elegant and chic. If you are looking for a traditional resturant and like chains this is not the place for you. This restaurant caters to a unique crowd., The food here--rich, deft, deeply flavorful and beautifully served--is outstanding. We were blown away. We had been equally impressed in 2005 when we discovered Fabio Trabocchi Maestro (just before it was named the # 1 by Washingtonian. We were sad when Fabio left for New York City--but thrilled when he returned. He didn let us down. While the Pennsylvania restaurant is austere, a tad cold and overly-lit (what stuck out visually against all the brown and white were the red exit signs everywhere), and the service was somewhat impatient and erratic, the food was utterly, utterly marvelous. To start, perfectly cooked melt-in-your mouth Hudson Valley foie gras with thinly sliced Fuji apple slices and a round of sensational Marche region lasagna like youe never eaten in a light foam with a touch of minced white truffles.You think youe eaten tasty lasagnas before? Fabio is like foie gras compared to chicken liver mousse. For the main courses, an expertly cooked unadorned slice of arctic char with a side of the best sauteed chard with garlic and olive oil Ie eaten, and another splendid hand-made pasta, this time with a ragu of wild hare. How I wish we could have sampled the desserts, but the food was wonderfully over-the-top rich, and the bread basket had earlier claimed us as willing victims: like a croissant, the waiter told us, little Turk caps of airy pastry done with olive oil rather than butter. Simply irresistible. We had two each, looking helplessly at each other. The wine? Confronted with a sea of $100+ bottles on the wine list, the water recommended a Lombardy chardonnay, Tenuto Mazzolino 8, at around $40 that was wonderful.The place was getting jammed by 7. We know why. Not to be missed. Just don eat anything before you go. Maybe don eat for two days before you go. Can hardly wait to return., Tuesday night reservation and dine in with the SO; overall the food was above average but the service was mediocre at best.Got all three appetizers they were serving that night, including a roasted pork belly and beans, ahi tuna crostini fisherman style with grilled country bread; and some sort of blood orange on a bed of seasoned sliced artichokes. The first two was great but the last one was nothing to write home about.When coming around to ordering wine they have this special white `orange tinted wine; which was very good -- a very dry wine which has been oxidized for a long time, giving it an orange hue.Both pasta entrees were good but not great; they both tasted like they had heavy amounts of sodium. For example the Pappardelle with wild hare and mushrooms were good but the castelmango cheese clashed with the dark heavy tasting sauce it was paired with.Overall the experience was good but service and the food could be better. Could be hype but I think they do have the above areas to improve on., Cocktails are very good (best Manhattan in DC) as is the wine list.Appetizers and pastas are better then the main courses Ive tried in the past three visits. Last visit the rabbit ragu pasta was the standout.Great Italian restaurant and will continue to return, One of the best meals that I have had in DC in years., Dined here on a Saturday night. Decor is nice and new. Seated right away since we had reservations although 2 in our party were running late.The food was a bit too rich for my liking. I went for the simple grilled fish but it was flavored with something. The octopus appetizer was ok but I like my octopus a bit firmer. The pasta course was ok, had some ravioli thing that tasted fresh although some edges were a bit too al dente. The mushroom side seemed healthy but a bit saucy. The fries were nice and crisp and tasty. I heard the pasta with lobster was delicious as was the fluke carpaccio. I think the venison was considered just ok.The gelato dessert was gross, it was a combination of flavors mixed that didnt work. It would have been better if each flavor was scooped out separately. I liked the little bonus dessert plate they sent out better. There was some dessert thing with grapefruit on the side that was considered just ok as well.Had 2 bottles of wine which were good, the waiter is your sommelier combined. The restaurant was really too noisy, even at a small table for 4, it was hard to hear the guest in front of you without really straining.The waiters kept bumping and brushing into my chair, knocking into my purse, and the floor vibrates as they thump by, that was not pleasant and I did not have room to scoot in further. Its nice that they hustle and bustle but made for a chaotic feel, maybe in the dining room they should walk more slowly. Took forever between the appetizer and the pasta course but the main entree came very quickly after the pasta.Its worth a try for sure for a special night out. I wouldnt rush back myself., Just had a truly wonderful lunch with outstanding service from Elver. Service is perfectly attentive and the food was fresh and simply terrific., When someone is truly passionate in what they do, wonderful things happen. Fabios masterful cuisine has elevated dining in Washington DC. I am fortunate to work in the building that houses the restaurant and make it a point to have lunch/dinner there a few times a month. Only suggestion- Fabio, you should install a small tv at the bar so that we can watch Italy win the Euro Cup!, came into here with great expectations and truthfully, we walked outta there with a smile on our face but nothing more. I dont think that this is the kind of place I would rush to go back to. Besides it being in DC, of course. But if I was back in DC right now, I would go look for another place. Its one of those places thats good to experience once. we got the ahi carpaccio and the sashimi slices on it were NOT carpaccio style. but whatever. good try to incorporate japanese food with whatever that place is. says italian but... im not too sure. the food wasnt bad at all. the service wasnt too bad either.the bathroom was broken. that part of it was junk. but overall, would i recommend it? sure why not. try it at least once. you wont be too disappointed and the prices are actually not too bad at all!, I had some high expectations based upon a lot of positive reviews, but I wasnt that excited. The restaurant is beautiful, although I wish theyd figure out some noise dampening materials to quiet the place down. The service was slow and odd - it almost seemed as if our server simply didnt understand us a couple of times. I tried the burger, which I know isnt the house specialty, but you can tell a lot about a place if they can pull off a well-made burger and fries (and it should be good, for $18). Mine was cooked to order and came on a really good bun. However, it comes with a mustardy sauce that I would order on the side next time - while tasty, it oozes all over the place. (Note: not a good first date order...) The fries are parmesan/rosemary and very good. But they serve them with marinara sauce, because they simply do not have ketchup. Really? At least have a sauce that makes sense for dipping. I can do fries+ a lot of things, but marinara is not one of them. The basil ginger lemonade was fabulous - lots of gingery bite and very refreshing. The cocktail list looked fabulous. Maybe Ill try again for drinks., Great Service...Great Food!, Fabulous! Ive had the pleasure of eating here twice and both meals were excellent as was the service. The chicken dish was a particular surprise. Superb. The only slight disappointment was desert as it didnt live up to the rest of the meal, but that just means it wasnt outstanding. Definitely a place to visit., Extremely loud and incredibly close - the tables for two are closer than college bar tables.DONT get a table second from either end, of the upper section. The end tables accommodate a third diner who sits at a right angle to your table for two creating a family style atmosphere of diners who feel free to join your conversation at any time, and make you an unwilling party to theirs. The service was crude and coarse, dishes thrown at us, our waiter yelled Are you done? at the end of each course.) My appetizer far different from the description, was a jar of cheese The bronzino was dry (frozen and cooked under a heat lamp?I understand Fabio is going for hip and urban but this was experience was loud and crude in every aspect. Fiola seems to cultivate a crowd (as well as waiters) who feel free to yell across the room whenever they like. The evening had all the charm of a keg party. Continuing the college bar theme, the bathroom was disgustingly dirty. It was hard to believe Trabocchi is associated with the food or the crass atmosphere. Or for the days of the masterpieces he used to turn out at Maestro., Fiola was one of 3 restaurants we made reservations with this week to celebrate our anniversary. Sadly, it was one of the most disappointing restaurants I have ever dined at in DC. Where do i even begin...First, I have to complain to Washingtonian. How is this restaurant ranked #8? From the food to the service, I fail to see how they even made the top 50. When we arrived we were immediately seated. Our server was polite and immediately offered us water. We wanted to look through the menu before making our selection on wine. The menu was difficult to read (what with the +, - , = signs, is it a menu or a math quiz?) After talking with the server, we decided to try the tasting menu, which included tuna tartar, lobster ravioli, and pine smoked venison. We also ordered a bottle of wine with our meal. The tuna tartar consisted for caviar, black truffles, blood orange, tuna, and whipped cucumber. The dish was incredibly salty and bitter. I took one bite and stopped. I could not eat any more of it. My husband, who can eat anything, navigated around the black truffles which he said made the dish incredibly bitter. The waitress just popped by and asked if we were done enjoying the dish. Rather than complain, I decided to see how the other two dishes went.Our second dish, the lobster ravioli, was disappointing. Most notable about the dish was the size. It consisted of *one* lobster stuff dumpling (not ravioli!) and a piece of lobster about the size of my thumb. Normally this plate is $38. For that price, I would have expected more on my plate. We dove right in despite the size, and quickly discovered the lobster was very chewy and difficult to cut with the butter knife we had. The dish was also lacking in cheese that could have helped blend the pasta and ravioli together. Also, like the tartar, even this dish was a bit salty. At this point, I was too hungry to care and try my best to chew it down.Our third dish, the pine smoked venison, was very good - except for three things. We ordered it medium rare, but it came out medium, and this was the third dish that was very salty. The cheese that accompanied the dish did not help the saliferous nature of the dish. The tasting menu we chose included desert. We sat around for about 20 minutes after our last dish waiting for desert. Finally a server whom we did not recognize came over with three deserts. We had not even picked out our desert. We stated our confusion and our server was sent over. She explained what was on our table. Again, we were confused. We were disappointed that we could not choose our desert. In front of us, we had one chocolate dish (one with coffee cream and the other with some almond cream), one dish of sorbets (neither one of us like sorbets), and some parfaits. We picked out what we could eat and left the rest to melt. Sadly, despite mentioning we were there celebrating our anniversary, we did not receive any sort of special dish, thank you note, or drink. For the cost of two tasting menu plates (at $110 each) and $70 bottle of wine, one would think we would left the restaurant feeling somewhat satisfied. This was not the case. Rather we felt out $300+ for a over seasoned meal and less than stellar service. For a top 10 restaurant, I would expect more from Fiola. Washingtonian, you have disappointed me. Please reconsider your high rating of this restaurant., Amazing experience. Real highlights were the Hudson Valley foie gras and the venison. Albeit extremely rich, both were decadent and extremely flavorful. While it pricey, you won leave feeling like you just ate at an over-priced Olive Garden, which is normally how I feel after eating at a lot of other fancy Italian places., Excellent food. Excellent wine. Top 5 in DC. I would go back here before Bourbon Steak, CityZen, 2941, Marcels (barely), or Restaurant Eve., Had dinner on Tuesday with 2 colleagues. I had been looking forward to this meal for weeks and perhaps this is why I was disappointed. - The restaurant was noisy and it was only a Tuesday.- The wines were okay. I sense that they cater to people who order $100 bottles so the wine I got for $60 - Montalcino - was mediocre at best. - I had a pappardelle with sausage and it was delicious. - Ordered an affogato and got 2 huge scoops of mediocre gelato and a big wad of chocoloate cake. Am I wrong in expecting a small espresso with a small scoop of gelato?- Service was great but I will not be going back. There are way to many places in the area with good food at lower prices and Proof is still my favorite for a more expensive meal.
25|garrison-washington|Chef Rob Weland formerly of Cork and Poste is a welcome addition to the Hill. Tonight was the a soft opening and everything ran exceptionally well. The restaurant is well staffed by a friendly, but extremely courteous and professional team.We sat at the bar and enjoyed a few different cocktails crafted by Gina Chersevani. The Downward Dog, was my favorite, the drink with pickled peaches was my second favorite, followed by the tequila, jalapeno and lime cocktail. If cocktails arent your thing, the wine offerings go beyond the standard varietals. I have already selected a few reds to try on my next visit.We started with the Poppy Seed Goug38res which are piped and baked to order. They are worth the wait. The locally sourced Bison entree followed, it was delicious but the next time I order it I will opt for rare, bison is so lean that cooking it to medium is a little much, but the dish was balanced by the lightly dressed, tomatoes, basil, and red onion, and garnished with a small wedge of blue cheese.We passed on desert, but the three offerings on the menu looked delicious. We arrived early but once word really gets out and things are in full swing, I would recommend making a reservation, especially for parties of 4 or more., The husband and I went with two friends last night. It was the restaurant first Saturday since it opened earlier in the week. Reservations were at 9pm. Restaurant had a number of open tables when we arrived, which surprised me honestly given some of the hype and coverage over the last couple months. Restaurant itself is quite charming. Love the style inside. Lighting is fantastic! Bar area is really cool and I love the banquettes -- remarkably comfortable (the pillows help). In short, the food was very good. Being a strong vegetarian I was really impressed with the assortment of veggies options. Flavors were very clean and simple, highlighting the local nature of the produce. Amongst us we had the three bean salad (x2), the fluke crudo, the squash blossoms, the grilled mushrooms with avocado, the bison, the striped bass, and the chocolate terrine for dessert. My favorite dish by far was the fluke crudo. This was divine -- the fresh fennel was such a perfect complement. The fish was amazingly fresh and the combination together was an amazing combination of bright, fresh and rich. I really enjoyed the three bean salad -- again beautifully fresh veggies. Could have probably had a bit more spice/herb/flavor, but overall very good.Our friend had the bison as his main course and said it was fantastic. The fresh heirloom tomatoes served with it were a great accompaniment. I had the striped bass and it was delicious. Just a little too rich for a summer night. The description on the menu makes it sound lighter than it is. If it is still on the menu in September Il order it again. One of the surprises was the mushrooms. I never would have thought to pair grilled mushrooms with avocados. It actually worked, although I would have like to see a few more mushrooms on the plate considering the dish is called Grilled Mushrooms.One suggestion, given the focus on the vegetables (again, which makes me very happy), maybe try to find a way to upsize a few of the veggie sides so that we vegetarians can have it as an entree. Just a thought. All four of our cocktails were at best mediocre. It may be sacrilege but I think Gina C. is the most overrated mixologist in DC. The Pump up the Volume is a weak attempt at frozen daiquiri, despite having beautiful ingredients, including Lillet Ros39 (annoying as can be that the menu doesn say it a frozen drink -- the wait staff should really tell people when they order it). I get the concept of trying to use some of your pickled veggies, but the drink that has the pickled vinegar stuff in it ends up tasting like cleaning product after a while. Re dessert, the chocolate terrine was delicious. So smooth and decadent. Really dark flavor. I will say though, the dessert selection was totally disappointing. So much hype about all of the fresh vegetables and fruits that Chef Weland has and his relationship with local farms and the three options were buttermilk panacotta, chocolate terrine and stone fruits wrapped in parchment paper. How are there no seasonal fruit sorbets or ice creams? Or what about light tarts or a crumble? It summertime -- people want something light to finish off dinner. Given that it was the fourth night, I won be too hard on the wait staff. Our waiter was nice enough, but he just wasn very good. Didn really pay attention, didn seem to have a command of the menu other than what was written on the page, etc. A different waiter brought us our appetizers -- when he set something down in front of me, I asked him what it was and he looked confused and then said Good question. Yikes. But overall, I feel like most of these things will settle down in a couple months. The only serious complaint I have is about the host. He was openly rude and snotty to us when we walked in (we were right on time, so it wasn an issue of being late or anything). Just copped attitude immediately. This needs to be addressed. Overall, really pleased with the experience and so excited to have another really good option in the neighborhood instead of more chains/pub food. Big thanks to Chef Weland for bringing his talents to those of us in SE DC. We will definitely be going back., When I walked in with a friend a few minutes before 5 pm, another friend was already at the bar because the restaurant did not start seating until 5 pm sharp. This was ok as I noticed right away how friendly and hospitable all the Garrison employees were. The bartender asked us if we wanted drinks, highlighting the beers on tap and offering to bring our drinks to the table when we did get seated in a booth with pillows. Another server made way for me when he saw me heading to the back to use the restroom after another person pointed me in the direction of the two unisex restrooms.The place is a little dark and is illuminated by iron light fixtures with Edison lightbulbs. There were 16 two seat tables along one wall and if you sit far back enough, youl see the open kitchen with a wood burning oven. On the other side are booths that comfortably sit four with beautiful sturdy wooden tables. There is one semi circular booth in the middle on the right side and bar seating towards the front. There is also outdoor seating. I love when a restaurant highlights seasonal ingredients and hesitates at labeling themselves as farm to table. When someone in our group made that comment, our server, Seth, was quick to say the restaurant works with high quality, sustainable ingredients and updates the menus daily to reflect the product availability of a CSA on the Hill, something we all noticed as we had been eyeing the menu for a week and had our orders in mind when we arrived last night and saw slight changes to the menu. This was A-OK as Chef Weland cooking style came through in the simple, clean flavors.Seth was incredibly gregarious and indulged our party of three on zany topics while making sure we were happy and full after indulging on rustic and in-house dishes that the three of us shared and gobbled up. The whole team was great in terms of filling up our glasses constantly, coming over to check periodically without being obtrusive, anticipating our needs, and being all around friendly. I believe the manager came over to serve us our entrees and I think Seth said he and the chef are around everyday and plan to be.The menu is organized by appetizers, raw & cured, vegetables, pasta, fish & seafood, fire-roasted meats, and dessert, and since we shared everything and were asked, our veggies were brought out together and before our entrees. There plenty to enjoy for all kinds of diners (although the entrees might have been a little small). As for what we ate:Poppyseed Gougeres - MUST ORDER! It takes about 10 - 12 minutes to prepare but these delicate airy cheese puffs were a table favorite. Served hot and best enjoyed immediately.Squash Blossoms - The clear winner amongst the vegetables as the romesco sauce went well with the fried blossoms. Fennel Gratin - Not my favorite, because I don like the licorice flavor. Large cuts of fennel that could use a bit more parmesan.Heirloom Tomato Salad - I don think I tasted the vanilla but the burrata and fresh tomatoes were clean and wonderful. Ravioli - I loved all three entrees and thought the ravioli, with its spinach filling, lemon accent, and fresh noodles were fantastic. Could not get enough and wish there was more. Hake - Perfectly cooked (seared on one side, tender and soft on the other) with some delicious potatoes and capers. Poached egg looked ugly but made the whole dish creamy and homey once broken.Char - Wonderfully prepared with thin slices of squash and zucchiniButtermilk Panna Cotta - Fruit jam added a little tartness to a creamy dessertStone Fruit Papillote - Interesting that the server came over to cut the parchment paper which housed the peaches. Within a second, you can smell the wonderful scents emanating from the enclosure which had a nice jam inside. Pour with the ricotta sauce and it was an unusually entertaining option.Chocolate Terrine - table winner for the dessert category. Not quite cake, not quite mousse, the chocolate flavor and texture was fantastic. It also helped to have fresh blackberries and cream for some contrast.A colorful jar of pickled vegetables and a candle adorned our table which I thought was a nice touch to add to the already warm and comforting aesthetic. Music was a little loud so we asked them to turn it down, especially because for about an hour, our party of three were the only ones in there and we couldn hear each other well. After reading a little more, I understand why I received a call from the restaurant about 2 hours before my reservation to confirm. They were accepting limited reservations and walk-ins during the soft opening and I am not sure if last night counted as part of it but in any case, after hearing that about 90 tables have been filled each night, they are clearly doing something right., Our big night out has been a long time coming, and having read some pretty promising reviews of Garrison leading up to our visit, I had relatively high expectations. Short story is that those expectations were met with respect to the focus on vegetables (hallelujah!) but a few other aspects of the experience were a little less shiny.Service was superb. Wed reserved with the intention of bringing our 1-mos-old (leaving our 2yo at home!), though we wound up childless (again, hallelujah!), and theyd saved us a table in the back. While this made sense for a baby, given that we were now alone and the restaurant was still relatively empty at 7pm on a Thursday night, I requested that we be relocated toward the front of the house. We essentially exchanged the noise of clanking plates for the din of conversation and music, which was a welcome change for me, out in an effort to feel like part of civilization again. Our original server accommodated us without a hint of irritation at losing a table; on the contrary, he was extremely understanding. Our server, Jeffrey, was amiable and opinionated without being overbearing. The manager made time to deliver a couple of plates and the bartender our drinks.Onto the grub. Being only two, we werent able to experience the whole menu, unfortunately, but heres what we got through:Poppyseed gougeres - Sold to us by our server pretty hard, we didnt hesitate to order a batch of these with our first set of cocktails. First bite, my impression was that I had melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness here, reminiscent of a souffle almost. Being critical, Id say our portion was slightly overbaked and a tad too salty.Burrata - Omigosh, better than the burrata I had in Italy. I dont know what else to say. The grilled peaches left a little to be desired. I suppose they were crunchy/a little less ripe on purpose, although I was expecting something more flavorful and succulent.Whole Roasted Eggplant - Id definitely get this again. I couldnt place the spice (sad, but true, Im off my game) but Id say it tasted a bit Indian. My hubs doesnt like hazelnuts but quipped that someone had finally found the right use for them. I wish theyd been a little more generous with the yogurt.Grilled King Trumpet Mushrooms - The jalapeno oil really sets this off. Would recommend this dish as well.Atlantic Char - Came so highly recommended we couldnt NOT order this. So glad we did not miss out on this deliciousness! Divinely prepared, dare I say this is the best piece Ive ever had, at least on the East Coast? The crispy crust paired with the tasty flesh cannot be beat.Stone Fruit Papillote - Apparently, I do not care for lavender, which drowned out the ricotta that had me excited about this dish. The peaches were a little bit on the mealy side.Chocolate Terrine - A hefty portion given the chocolate factor here. Yum!Cocktails - Overall, Id say tasty, although my husband found them a little overpriced for their strength, although I recognize thats not a trait everyone covets in a cocktail. My first drink, Movin On Up, was knock-your-socks-off strong and pretty unique. His, the Downward Dog, was less so. It Takes Two is also on the lighter side; I was worried about tasting the beer, but its subtle. The tequila/jalapeno drink, the name eludes me, was a bit too much on the sugary side for either of our liking. My personal fave was the Right Stuff, which reminded me of an old fashioned.Ill definitely be back for the vegetables and to try their pastas, but I will go a little lighter on the drinks next time. I should also note that despite our bill being +$200 (thanks to our indulging majorly in the drinks side of the menu), I was still hungry; I came home and ate a small helping of leftovers. Shh! Dont tell., We were really excited about this new opening and went on Tuesday, July 28 at 7.30pm. The restaurant had a decent amount of people but was not full, so walk-ins definitely seem possible. Perhaps as the hype increases, this won be true anymore.We got the cauliflower and the mushrooms as an appetizer, and the tortellini and duck as entrees, followed by the chocolate thing for dessert. The food was all delicious. However, for an appetizer called grilled mushrooms, there was about a total of 2 mushrooms thinly sliced on the plate. It was mostly avocado. The tiny pieces of mushroom were delicious, but I wish there was more. Also, the berries on the side of the chocolate thing had a very strange, herby flavour. I don like whatever it was marinated in. Other than that, we licked our plates clean.Now the reason I took off a star, and considered taking off more stars, is that the portion sizes were TINY. If you get 2 appetizers, 2 main courses, and a dessert, you shouldn leave hungry! We do not have big appetites and usually cannot finish our food, but this time, we had to supplement. Especially for the prices - we spent over $100 on our meal and went home HUNGRY. Garrison either needs to lower their prices or increase the portion sizes. I think someone should feel full after an appetizer and main course., Growing pains. Service is sloooooow and disorganized. Portions are miniscule -- two bites for $14 for side dish veggies. When it finally arrives at the table, the food is really fresh and well prepared. But the rest of the experience does not justify the price paid., This was a great meal. They need to explain the menu a bit but overall a great success. We started with the Gougeres which were delicious. From there we moved on to Cauliflower and the Mushrooms again a success. My wife had the Arctic Char and I had the Bison Hangar steak. Everything was cooked as expected and the service was on point. I cannot agree with previous reviews about burned veg because I would call the veg char grilled not burned but perhaps my experience was different. The service was very attentive and the wine selection was impressive. We will definitely be back for another go., Ravioli is a must. It was really, really fantastic. Light, refreshing and rich all at once. It also was nice because you can split the pasta between 2 people for a buck or two more. And everything including the ricotta is made in house. I was disappointed by the squash blossoms. They were kinda normal and nothing to write home about. The sauce paired with them was quite good though. We also got a fish dish which was really flavorful -- but somewhat normal. I liked our waiter-- but he extremely excited which was nice. But when we asked for his recommendation he didnt really help-- just suggested just about everything. One thing that somewhat bothered me-- is that the restaurant coins itself as an new American restaurant, yet most of the items on the menu were not English. I liked the atmosphere-- it is a bit loud -- but it adds to the ambiance. I would definitely go back and stock up on all the ravioli., So thrilled to have this fantastic new addition to Barracks Row that is seriously going to give Roses Luxury some much needed friendly competition. We were really pleasantly surprised to be able to book a same day table for a large group. Every aspect of our experience lived up to the hype that is expected when a well known chef opens their own establishment. Garrison is, simply put, OUTSTANDING! Food: This is a food lovers heaven! Every single dish we ordered was phenomenal. Must try as many of the vegetable sides as you can: Cauliflower, Mushrooms, Beets, heirloom tomorrow salad with a lovely (celery?) ice...they were all very delicious. Maybe its the farm to table flavor, but vegetables have never tasted so good! On the mains: my hands down absolute favorite was the sweet corn tortellini (and Im not usually one to chase a pasta dish as a main). Im guessing this may not always be on the menu (once corn is out of season) so go now and try it! Our group also ordered the Hake and duck, which were also excellent. Desserts: dont leave without trying at least one. We actually had all of them and honestly, I cant pick a favorite. The fruit en papillote with ricotta sauce is so wonderfully nuanced you wont be able to stop eating it (we were told its flavored with lavender and earl grey tea leaves). But the panna cotta and Chocolate were equally fantastic. Service: The manager Sam was super friendly and accommodating from the time I called over to make the reservation. Our waiter was equally fantastic. He was very knowledgeable about the dishes, made great recommendations and was fun to talk to without being intrusive. Ambiance: Warm and cozy. Not pretentious. Go now while tables are still relatively easy to snag. Garrison is truly among DCs finest., Our party of two had a great dinner at Garrison. Our party of two had a little bit of everything and shared. The Gougeres are fantastic little combinations of cheese, poppy seed and salt. We actually ordered a second bowl after too quickly polishing off the first. Definitely worth starting your meal with at least one bowl. My personal faves included the gazpacho, which was fantastically refreshing, and the homemade pastas, especially the ravioli, which was done perfectly. Also, we really appreciated the number of vegetable options! The wine list was interesting and offered some budget-conscious options in addition to pricier bottles. We noted that some reviews cited service issues, but ours was prompt with drinks and all other aspects of the meal. We look forward to putting this place into our neighborhood restaurant rotation., You should eat here. Maybe not every day--its a little bit spendy. But soon. And then sometime after that again probably.Our party of five ordered the gougeres, burrata, all of the vegetable dishes (minus squash blossoms, which they were out of), both of the pastas, and all three desserts--which was either just the right amount of food, or just barely too much. Were still deciding.Most of the dishes were very good (for example, the pastas rival Osteria Morini or Acqua al 2, which are the best local pasta spots). Two dishes were outstanding:(1) The roasted cauliflower. The doneness and size of the pieces was perfect (each chunk was a couple florets--more than a mouthful, but the right size to make sure that each piece had texture and could easily be cut apart), and it was beautifully accented with pickled sweet and hot peppers and pine nuts. If you like the cauliflower at, e.g., Zaytinya, this is better. My wife called it the best roasted cauliflower she had ever eaten. Its a bold claim, but shes probably right.(2) The heirloom tomato salad. This one owes its goodness to the strength of the produce, and this restaurant is very good at sourcing produce. In addition to some burrata, they also put mint sorbet on the plate, which was a cool riff on the herb component of the salad. The tomatoes were the real star though. If you like tomatoes, youll love this dish. If you dont care for them, skip it.Along with dinner we each had a couple drinks. Our round of cocktails was good. The Behind Closed Barracks has a cool ingredient I hadnt seen before (toasted coconut soda). The Right Stuff is a great bourbon pre-dinner drink. The Downward Dog was our least favorite--tasted over-diluted to me. They offered to take it back and replace it, but the person who ordered it chose to keep it, so it couldnt have been that bad. We had the waiter do a wine pairing for our second round, and that worked out splendidly.The thing about the Downward Dog raises another important point: service was very good. The waiter was cool, had lots of good ideas about the meal, and went out of his way to help us. For example, when one person in our party pointed out that they are a strict vegetarian (and so cant eat desserts set with gelatin), the waiter kindly brought out an extra chocolate terrine on the house. That sort of graciousness deserves some mention.The tab before tip was $310, which isnt cheap. But the room is nice, the service is all-pro, and the kitchen is putting out really good work. If you can afford it, this place is good value. And you could easily make it a bit cheaper by putting together a dinner for two comprising the tomato salad, the cauliflower, one pasta, one dessert, and a reasonably priced bottle of wine., My husband and I were excited to try a new restaurant in Barracks Row, especially one that been receiving such good press in the blogs. Overall, I say that the food is incredible, but the management of the restaurant still has some work to do. Before I get into the food, I wanted to mention something that I hope they will fix soon: if you have a food allergy, please make sure to mention it to the waiter. They do not always label all the ingredients on their menu.At a table next to ours, a woman was saying that she had an allergic reaction to something she eaten there a few days before and the night we were there, she had to return a dessert that had nuts as a garnish (that was not mentioned on the menu). A similar thing happened at the table on the other side of us: the people were asking about a squash blossom dish, the waiter mentioned the sauce was a pesto and that it had nuts. Again, nuts were not mentioned on the menu. Additionally, the music was a bit off and the space, while improved from Tash, is still a bit strange- weirdly cut off, no real place to greet customers, etc. Now on to the food. It was delicious. My husband and I only ordered vegetables, and were they incredible! So fresh and accompanied with delicious garnishes. My favorite dish was the heirloom tomatoes with burrata. It almost felt wrong putting the cheese on the tomatoes because the tomatoes were incredible by themselves. Great dish. Another dish that was spectacular were the fried squash blossoms; the cheese is delicious and the pesto underneath is delicious.The cauliflower was quite tasty, although be prepared that it has a kick to it that you wouldn expect. The mushrooms are also deceptively spicy but the avocado underneath them helps balance it out. The burrata was excellent, but some of the peaches were a bit charred. It was very tasty though. My husband got the gazpacho and really liked the mustard ice cream on top. Finally, he ordered the chocolate dessert and thought it was quite delicious. I sure that the menu is going to change frequently, so I encourage you to simply try new & different things than you might normally. The ingredients are fresh, local and delicious; the only downside being that they are a tad expensive. I so excited that this restaurant is only a few blocks from where I live. It will definitely become a staple for us., I am so disappointed to report that we enthusiastically gave Garrison a try and were not particularly pleased. I could go through a list of everything that we ordered, but I think that the point that would be made is that for a fresh new restaurant most of what we were served, in the manner in which it was served, was sad. Extremely small portions for larger portion prices, relatively bland food and lackluster service, by both server and manager alike. Its a new restaurant still working out the kinks, but from the moment we walked in we felt the stress of the staff, which didnt create a relaxing or enjoyable dining experience. It hurt to pull my wallet out for this one, Im definitely going give ample time for Garrison to work the many kinks out before giving it a second shot. : (, Had the service been great, I would be writing a 4-star review because the food is very tasty. The menu is a bit unclear and when we asked how much we should order, didnt get a clear answer from the waiter. He also was pushy that we order everything at once so they can pace, which I understand but he shouldnt really say that. Overall, the service was just kind of awkward and unhelpful. The food really is delicious but its too much money for what it is. The sweet corn tortellini is very good but its $23 for a pretty-small portion. And a small piece of fish was close to $30. Since we were sharing these items (and others) it felt like not enough and thats never a good feeling when youre hoping to share a lovely, communal meal. I feel like they are trying to blaze in charging Roses Luxury prices but dont have the credibility (or creativity or service) to do so yet., Just tried Garrison for the first time tonight and was not disappointed! The menu was very inventive and so beautifully presented - it reminded me of Roses Luxury! Was with a group and tried the squash blossoms, mushrooms with avocado, poppyseed gougeres, and the chicken liver parfait for appetizers- all were so delicious and so gorgeous. The toast with the chicken liver was perfect. For dinner we had the char, the hake, and the bison, and everything was seriously delicious and perfectly cooked. Our server was so friendly and helpful too. To top everything off they offer delicious homemade caramels which were so yummy. Wonderful addition to Barracks Row and we will definitely be going back!, We were fans of Tash and wanted to not like Garrison for taking its place. Then we heard from One Acre Farm, the CSA to which we subscribe, that theyd partnered up. OK, well give them a go.We went last night for a long-delayed birthday dinner for my wife. We made a reservation online and headed out, infant in tow. We were easily accommodated in a 4-top booth toward the back where we knew we wouldnt bother other diners. The decor is definitely changed from Tash, but the best parts--the banquettes, the bathrooms--have remained.Service was very good: attentive and genuinely friendly. Staff all seemed knowledgeable about both the menu and wine offerings and were eager to talk about the plans for the future of the restaurant.We started out with the poppyseed gougeres, baked to order and wonderful. A warm and lightly flaky crust gave way to the rich cheese interior. The poppyseed across the top retains a bit of crunch in a bite that could otherwise be overwhelmed by the softer textures within. Additionally, we had the heirloom tomato salad with burrata and the roasted cauliflower. The tomatoes were, of course, impossibly fresh, and the pairing with mint worked perfectly. The cauliflower was a standout: impeccably roasted, served in a still-hot cast iron skillet, and seasoned with reggiano and pine nuts.For mains, my wife had the ravioli, which she greatly enjoyed, but which I did not try.I had the char, and it was one of the best-prepared pieces of fish Ive had in years. The flesh was as tender and yielding as if poached, but the skin was as shatteringly crisp as a potato chip. There is no substitute for this kind of technical excellence.Desserts were the stone fruit en papillote and the chocolate terrine, both good, but the stone fruit was the standout here. Served still hot and freshly opened, redolent of a floral herb (lavender?) and possessed of the kind of wholesome sweetness one hopes for in such a dessert.This place is everything one could hope for when hearing that they are focused on seasonal, local, and fresh ingredients. Keep up the good work, Garrison!, Great food - We had the tomato salad, roasted cauliflower, whole eggplant and squash blossoms. Everything was fresh and delicious with just the right amount of seasoning to maximize flavor, but not overwhelm the vegetables. Took one star away for inattentive service., Had a going away dinner at Garrison one week ago and thought it was delicious! Great atmosphere and became very busy by dinner time so luckily we had a reservation. We started out with a couple small bites, including the radishes, chicken liver pate, and buns. The radishes won everyone over but as it is a seasonal/local menu theyre probably already off :( We all different main meals and everyone was extremely pleased with their order. I had the duck which was delicious and great portions of actual meat rather than a thick layer of fat. Some other favorites were both of the pastas and the bison. I wish we would have maybe subbed the rolls small bites with one of their many vegetable dishes. The portions are on the smaller side so if youre very hungry I definitely recommend grabbing an app or two or a vegetable side. Otherwise everything is delicious and fresh!, Outstanding first dining experience at Garrison. First of all, thank you to Garrison for respecting your customers and taking reservations. I can stand the inhospitable policy that more and more restaurants seem to be adopting these days of refusing to take reservations. Second, the food and service were wonderful. My friends and I literally wanted to order every single vegetable dish on the menu because they all sounded so amazing. Regrettably, we ended up restraining ourselves somewhat, so Il have to return soon to try the rest, but we still managed to enjoy a good sampling of the menu. Everyone who dines here should order the gougeres, the wonderful little bread puffs that are both light and indulgently cheesy. Dangerously addictive. We also started with the gazpacho with mustard ice cream. It was so good that one friend declared it one of the best gazpachos she ever had, and the mustard ice cream was a deliciously unique feature. In addition, we shared the following fantastic dishes: tomato salad with burrata, mushrooms with avocado, stuffed squash blossoms, roasted cauliflower, and the sweet corn tortellini. While all were delicious, my other friend declared upon her first bite of the corn tortellini, It so good I want to cry. Note that the vegetable and pasta dishes are rather small so you need several to make a filling meal for yourself (I suggest approx. 3 per person, depending on your hunger level). Finally we shared the fruit papillote with sweet ricotta sauce for dessert, which was a nice light way to end the meal on a sweet note (although we found ourselves wishing that it consisted of some sort of pastry to make it a bit more substantial and indulgent). Even the beverages here are delicious, including the fruity and herbal iced tea and the bold French press coffee. Lastly, they give you these amazing house-made buttery-sweet caramels that melt in your mouth at the end of the meal. Throughout the meal, our server was very professional and answered our questions in a way that showed a great deal of knowledge about the menu. It was a great experience. I look forward to returning and will definitely recommend it to others., Small plates, very fresh ingredients. Pricey but some of the more innovative dishes like the gaspacho with mustard ice cream well worth it. Small fish fillet perfectly cooked. I was not thrilled to pay seven dollars for a very small bowl of plain (albeit fresh) rolls though. Interesting wine list - a number of different Austrian wines for example. Nice addition to the neighborhood but as more of an occasional splurge than a restaurant I would go to on a regular basis though., Garrison is a little too pretentious for the quality of the food. Everything we had was very tasty, but portions are very small and prices are not. We went with five people of varying appetites, and all went home to eat PB&J after bread, appetizer, and entree (totaling nearly $50 per person on food alone).All of the food was well prepared, but nothing was terribly memorable and portions are unreasonably small, even on staples like lentils under a piece of fish. The drinks were excellent, though pricy even compared to swanky (and superior) cocktail bars like Copycat (its my favorite...what can I say?)., I visited Garrision in mid-October 2015 to celebrate a friends birthday. I had never heard of the spot so I was really excited to go. Tapas is usually on the pricey side especially when folks order several items. However, its never a good sign when the restaurant is tapas AND had a limited menu. While the waitress was pleasant, service was slow with food being sent out in random order. We tried several items including the poppyseed gougere, parker house rolls, castelvetrano olives, eggplant, grilled mushrooms, roasted cauliflower, sweet corn tortellini, farro cavetlli and the pigs trotter. For desert, we opted for the pear and concord grape cobbler. Folks in my party enjoyed the pigs trotter and eggplant. Unfortunately, for me, this place overall was a miss. I found the food to be just okay and extremely overpriced. Personally, I would only suggest this spot for drinks and desert. The cobbler was actually amazing and the spot is intimate and cozy which makes for a decent after dinner outing., The Garrison doesnt stick out until you give it a chance. It has 3.5 stars on Yelp and hidden at the end of 8th Street on Barracks Row. The first time we went, we only grabbed a drink and almost missed out on this 5-star restaurants food. We recently went back and wow. Amazing. Every dish uses seasonal ingredients and change all the time. Ask your server what s/he recommends. We ordered the seasonal sweet corn tortellini and was the best tortellini weve ever had. We also ordered the roasted cauliflower and that grilled mushrooms. Both were simple but looked beautiful and tasted amazing and fresh. No matter what drink you get, youll savor ever sip. If you like sweeter drinks (but not overwhelmingly sweet) order the Right Stuff. If you like a little spice, try the Siamese Fireback. You wont be disappointed! The service was spot on and the atmosphere inviting (though, a bit dark). Were looking forward to coming back!, Tried the brunch at Garrson today- Highlights- the pastrami - house made in the red flannel hash- delish! And the piece dresistance would be the poppy seed gourgeres ! Melt in your mouth goodness- I would recommend that you order your gourgeres first and not tell your waiter the rest of your order- although they specifically are called appetizers our gourgeres came after we received our main dish. I had asked the waiter that I would like to start with the gourgeres. I mentioned it to our waiter and he did apologize but that was it- I will say the puffs were hot and delicious - right out of the oven! But I would of much preferred to enjoy them alone with my bloody Mary. We had the cauliflower and the mushrooms- I thought both were missing the advertised spicy flavor. But the cauliflower was very flavorful. Mushrooms boring. Thought the whole meal was overpriced- almost 200 for 2 for brunch!!! Come on. No artificial sugar for your coffee- almost saying - you shouldnt be using it! Not too customer friendly! Would try it for dinner but only after visiting a few more top new places in DC., I actually liked Tash brunch, but the place was always empty. The Garrison? Much the opposite. I arrived for our dinner reservation and the bar and restaurant were bustling. The atmosphere is as cozy as can be and the service was top notch. The host was welcoming and didn rush us as I visited with my mom and a friend at the bar before taking our table, and even took care of closing our tab out personally. Our waitress was wonderful, friendly and full of recommendations without being overbearing. The food? Well, overall it was good but not necessarily all mind blowing. Here what we had:-Poppyseed Gougeres - okay, so these were mind blowing. Everything youe read is true. Mom and I ordered a basket, and finished the whole thing in minutes muttering to each other, but really, we have to eat them while their hot. When you take a bite, you think youe biting into cream-filled dough but that just the texture of the cheese-swirled batter. Order a basket for yourself, because #YOLO.-Roasted Eggplant Terrine - this was good, but I think it would have been better warm. Overall, enjoyable.-Grilled mushrooms and avocado - super plain, not worth your money. Low on seasoning and substance.-Sweet corn tortellini - this was pretty awesome, particularly the sauce. Save some bread to sop it up.-Herb Crusted Hake - again, pretty enjoyable but not mind blowing. Small portion for the price.-Warm date pudding with prune and armagnac ice cream - this. was. awesome. Almost as good as the sticky toffee pudding I made at Thanksgiving, which is an incredibly high bar. Value for the cost: overpriced. For comparison sake, Rose the nationally acclaimed restaurant across the street: the homemade potato bread comes free, unlike the poppyseed gougeres. The vegetable dishes are priced similarly to Rose small plates, which are more consistently awesome and more substantial. The pasta is the same size at Rose, half the price and just as awesome. And the entrees, which err on the small size, are the same price as the family style dishes at Rose, which serve 4.Walking out of a restaurant, I always make an assessment of whether I come back. For the vast number of restaurants I say I never would, simply due to the vast number of options in D.C. Walking out of the Garrison I definitively declared I be back. The overall experience was a lovely evening in a lovely setting - I can wait to try their brunch!, Seated 47 minutes late after repeated 10 more minutes assurances & treated like an errant child by the staff. Food smells great but seriously terrible customer service & clock management., My husband and I came here to celebrate our anniversary and while the food was great, I left the meal with mixed emotions. As others have said, the Poppyseed Gougeres were divine! We split the artic char cones, I had hangar steak (which was cooked perfectly!), while my husband had the the sweet potato tortellini (also delicious). My biggest problem with the Garrison is how closely they put the two top tables together. Just past the bar to the left, there are 4 two top tables in a row, we were placed in the middle. Im not exaggerating when I say there were 10-12 inches between tables. Ive NEVER been in a restaurant where the tables were placed so close together.I could have easily reached over and taken a bite of food of my neighbors plate! Truthfully it was uncomfortable and I just wanted to get out of there a soon as we finished our food. We could hear EVERYTHING the tables were saying on either side of us and it was distracting, not romantic or relaxing at all. Since the restaurant was packed there was no option to change tables. For what its worth, Im 31 and go out to restaurants a lot, I love sitting at the bar and dont mind communal tables in general. But, this is upscale dining and I expect to have a little more space when paying $30 for an entree. At restaurants I want to enjoy the company of the people I came with and enjoy the food. Sadly, you cant do that at the Garrison because of the poor restaurant design. I live in the neighborhood and probably wont go back., Had brunch with 7 others and it was the worst brunch I ever had. I have a meetup Brunch group and we go to brunch every Sunday.Took us 40 minted to get order. All the plates were too hot to touch which means theye were sitting under a heat lamp or nuked. Several had duck sausage with biscuits,..how many ways can I say terrible. They were so dried out and tasteless except for the games taste. Biscuits were cold and hard and when I told waiter, he took them back and nuked them...could even give me fresh ones. We had to cut our fried eggs with a knife...that how tough they were. Another lady had the Red Flannel Hash ..supposed to be corned beef hash but instead she got 2 hard thick slices of pastrami that she could not eat. To add insult to injury, food was so overpriced especially considering how awful it was. $12, maybe even $15 but $22 was ridiculous. Heard this place is so crowded, all tables in the back Wee empty and u can see why.I never bother to write reviews..,this is my first time but this entire experience as so OMG horrible !!!, Special occasion, date night, friends from out of town, walk to dinner! Thats the latest entry on 8th Street SE, Barracks Row. Wow, this place is already popular because it is GREAT and never disappoints. Exceptional cuisine, thoughtful and creative chef and they grow much of their own produce/herbs. GO! Make a reservation ahead, vibrant, lively and fun., I had dinner there a couple of months ago and it was okay. Food was decent but very overpriced for what you get. Below is what we had:-Poppyseed gougeres - very good - best thing we had, though came out pretty late in the meal-Bison tartare - pretty good-Squash blossoms - good-Caprese - not good at all, bad tomato and made with bad basil sorbet that melted and created a weird brown soup-Sweet corn tortellini - pretty good but very small portion considering $25 price tag-Duck - again pretty goodOverall the food was pretty good, except for the caprese, but nothing special. We left hungry after ordering 6 courses for two people (including two entrees) and since the food wasnt great we wont be going back., Went back, Ivan was our waiter, everything was tops! Miss the duck, however; the hanger steak was a fine replacement. The hake was perfectly cooked. Will return., The ambiance and food dont disappoint! Our server, Rebekah, was knowledgable (without being pushy) and personable (without being fake). We will definitely return!, I requested a dry sherry before my dinner only to receive a quizzical look from the server who then handed me a list of cocktails on which was listed only one type of sherry - sweet. Guess there is no room at the bar for an additional bottle of Fino. This was the same server who took our order without providing any suggestions and who told my companion that pig trotters were similar to pork shanks. Moments later the couple next to us was served by a different person who spent at least 5 minutes suggesting combinations and providing very helpful information about how the dishes were prepared. I ordered the herb-crusted hake which was delicious althought the accompanying whole grain mustard sauce seemed nothing more than mustard from a jar which did nothing to enhance the flavor of the hake. My companion ordered the pig trotters only to find nothing resembling a shank but more like a slice of pate which left him still hungry despite its $27 price. High prices, small portions and a limited menu mean we won be back., I think the food was excellent. We had the squash blooms, cheese balls, and so many other items and I thought it was all prepared perfectly. But the PRICE for such small portions (I guess they call this small plates) didn thrill me. If they were a little less expensive my friends and I would come here more often for drinks and food., Went for dinner. Cost atmosphere, attentive service and above all delicious food.I had a dinner Special, the duck cassoulet (out of this world) and the poppy seeds were piping hot and absolutely delicious. My girl got the arctic char and she loved it!I would recommend this place to anyone! Best dinner experience Ive had in DC so far., Delicious innovative food and great service. The three main dishes we ordered--the hake, sweet potato tortellini, and the arctic char--were all excellent. This restaurant exceeded my high expectations., Wow! Where to begin???This place provides a dining experience of world-class quality. The mix of flavors & food combinations is absolutely spectacular. We started with the poppyseed gougeres & they were as good as all the gushing reviews said they were. The vegetables were excellent as well. The rutabagas were the best Ive ever had. They tasted like candy!Our favorite entree was the sweet potato pasta. Perfect! The char was good, too.We finished with the baked hot chocolate--if I could think of another superlative, Id use it here.The service was flawless as well. Then again, I will say quite a bit of time passed between the vegetable course & the entrees. We were with fun people so we didnt mind at all. If youre looking for a dining experience that you will remember fondly for a very long time & you dont mind spending $150 for four people, you cant do better than here., Given the price point - we expected a lot more from Garrison. The restaurant scene was great and so was service but we will not be headed back b/c the food was underwhelming, limited and expensive., Four stars. Could be five. Some inspired dishes that were executed with decent but not stellar attention to detail. Food gras excellent. Trotters very good. Gougeres were decent but overs alter. At the end, our waiter disappeared and two other people served us instead. We went on a big snow night so have the cut them some slack for that., We were excited to try Garrison, given the strong reviews it had received when it opened especially for the treatment of vegetables. Overall, we thought the food wasn bad, but it also wasn particularly good. We ordered the poppyseed gougeres, which I thought were a bit undercooked (they were mushy in the middle and soft), though they tasted good. They were probably the best thing we had.We also ordered the cider-glazed rutabaga, the cauliflower with pickled peppers and mint, the smoked potatoes with black garlic aioli, and the farro cavatelli with broccoli and garlic. My friend said the cauliflower was a poor approximation of the one she had at Stephanie Izard The Girl and the Goat in Chicago. Everything was... ok. The potatoes I thought were underseasoned and the garlic flavor was not very strong. The smokiness was VERY subtle - I don love smoky things but it was barely discernible to me. The cavatelli was just... not good. There was barely any flavor in the dish, and it DEFINITELY was not worth $25 dollars - the portion size and quality put it more in the $10-12 range, like the rest of the dishes we ordered. Everything was just.. meh.We ordered the winter citrus cake as a dessert and were not impressed by that either. The cake itself was dense and very dry, and the way the dish was composed made it awkard to eat. There was some sort of citrus curd on the bottom, which helped balance the dryness of the cake, but there wasn enough for each bite of cake to have some. The frosting was hard and not very flavorful, and dotted in little white kisses around the plate. There was also a blood orange sorbet which was... very meh. The whole dish has a sort of metallic tang to it which I found distracted from the citrus flavor. The best part of the whole thing was probably the one slice of candied citrus that was an accent on the plate.Overall, we paid $50 each for a dinner (no drinks) that was probably worth about $35. It was not bad, it just also was not good. My take-away was that at that price point.... we should have just walked down the block and waited at Rose., I would say Garrison is 3.5 stars more then 3 stars. We came here for dinner on a Saturday night so we could only get a 530 reservation. Ivan was our server and he was super friendly and fantastic from the start!We started with the poppyseed cheese bites and were not disappointed. We also ordered the cauliflower which was slightly spicy but very tasty. For our entrees, we got the Arctic char and both the pasta dishes (a half order of each) to share. The pasta was positively divine and the char was also well done. As others have noted, the portions are rather small so I would probably recommend getting an additional dish to share. We werent really hungry so we were satisfied but I could see how mothers would leave hungry. We skipped dessert and went elsewhere. The meal wasnt cheap, however we still enjoyed the good service and quality of the dishes. While it was all tasty, I expected to be more wowed than we were for the price and reputation. There wasnt any dish that amazed us so we likely wouldnt come back., After so many neighbors swinging from one star to 5 star on their evaluation of Garrison, I thought I would try it for myself. First the service was exceptional. A true fine dining experience in my book. We decided to have a sampling of menu items share. The cheese puffs (forgot proper name) are a requirement for every table. We ordered the local radishes with kefir butter, the fluke crudo,The Foie Gras special, and the Arctic Char. With a couple of glasses of wine the dishes were a nice pairing. The food is exquisite. The local radishes we couldnt put down. Foie Gras was melt in your mouth perfect. All was phenomenal. From my perspective, this place deserves five stars. Lets hope they stay consistent - as consistent as Belga has been for me for the past decade - my go to place for biz dinners, birthday celebrations, just a good high quality meal, etc. Garrison after this experience can become another go to place. All high marks and worth a repeat and again and again., After a $50 per person meal, youd hope something would really stand out and wow you, but unfortunately nothing rose to that level. We ordered all vegetarian dishes because my friend is a vegetarian. At other places, I would think could be detrimental to the experience-- but since reviews in the Washington Post and other reputable sources have mentioned how strong the vegetable dishes were, I figured it would be an accurate representation of the cooking at this relatively new restaurant. We got the poppyseed gougeres ($7) to start, which were fun and bite-sized and the best thing we ate all night. Then we got cider-glazed rutabaga, potatoes with a black garlic sauce, cauliflower with pickled peppers and mint and farro cavatelli with broccoli. I love root vegetables, but the rutabaga seemed kind of bland and didnt really come together for me until I got a bite with lots of hazelnuts. I could eat potatoes and garlic all the day, so that dish seemed tailor-made for me, but the garlic sauce didnt seem quite garlicky enough and the potatoes were just fine-- not really crisp or exciting in any way. They could be a good side dish to something but on their own didnt seem to warrant a dish. The cauliflower, sadly, could not compare to the amazing dish I had at Girl and the Goat in Chicago. They used basically the same ingredients but somehow this one just lacked the magic! The aforementioned dishes were all about $11, which seemed reasonable for the portions, so we were surprised when the $25 pasta came and was a similar size. Not sure if it it was the special locally-grown, hand-picked farro (thats along the lines of what the waiter told us about it) or what, but it was disappointing. The whole dish lacked flavor-- again, there was garlic in the description but I didnt get much there. There wasnt enough sauce to coat the pasta at all. I was pretty excited to try the winter citrus cake but found it dry. It was paired with weird, hard-ish bits of frosting dotting the plate, a curd on the bottom (which I sadly didnt find until I already took a couple dry bites) and a blood orange sorbet. I wish everything had melded a little more.I might give this place another try during the summer to see what they can do with those veggies, but overall, this just wasnt what I imagined after hearing all the hype., Garison is an ambitious restaurant in SE Dc with adventurous food that still feels homey and delicious. We started with the poppy seed gougeres and the mangalista ham, both savory and delicious. Our main dishes were heavenly and the cocktails were impeccable. Best of all, the service was excellent- our server Rebekah handled us with grace and the manager was continually checking in on all the tables to make sure everything was up to snuff- which it was! The delicious food and great service made this worth the $., We chose to celebrate Valentines Day at Garrison after looking at their unique menu. Well, we left pretty disappointed after a bland and underwhelming dinner.We started with the poppyseed gourgettes (cheese popper type things). These were the best part of dinner, and we are glad we got them as our main entrees were very little.I ordered a dish off the specials menu which was tagliatelle with fresh truffles and parmesan. At $35 I was expecting something substantial and delicious. This was boring pasta with a few truffles on top. No texture, no flavor. Waste of $35. My husband got the chicken liver which was extremely rich, decent but nothing we would get again.He also had the fingerling potatoes with black garlic aioli. These were tasty, and was a very nice sized portion.We were still hungry and ordered the baked hot chocolate to share. This is a small dessert, not really big enough for sharing. The chocolate was too hot, so we didnt really get the flavors. The restaurant is very comfortable, decorated beautifully and well staffed with knowledgeable servers. In the future when looking for an expensive, nice meal I would look elsewhere., My fianc39 and I went for Valentines. The decor is welcoming and warm. Good lighting and enjoyed the open kitchen experience. The reason its a 3 is the intersection between the style of food preparation, food presentation, and price dont really work very well. Its essentially small plates of pretty decent cuisine at a very high price. Service was fine but nothing to write home about. I could enjoy a better meal in just as nice surroundings with polished service for half the price at several restaurants that come to mind within a few miles. Its a glad we checked it out but wont go again kind of a place., My partner and I chose the Garrison for our annual obligation (aka Valentines Day) dinner. We actually went the night before Valentines Day, which was frigid to say the least, and almost cancelled our reservations. We started out with a glass of rose and a cocktail, and after looking at the specials, we decided to split the following:-Poppyseed gougeres (very similar to the Brazilian Pao de qeuijo, salty goodness)-Seared Foie gras, raisin toast (the most expensive dish, but soooo decadent and so worth it!)-Cider glazed rutabaga (executed perfectly, made a rutabaga lover out of my boyfriend)-Roasted cauliflower (simple, but paired beautifully with the brininess of the peppers and the richness of the pinenuts)-Crispy envelope of pigs trotter (my least favorite of the dishes, as I wish the egg was firmed up a bit more, but nonetheless very tasty)Personally, I thought everything was delightful. I cant really think of anything that I disliked. I know from previous reviews that the portions are small for the pricing, but not including drinks we spent about $40 a person and left pretty full. My partner likes his food on the salty side, and did mention that he wished the dishes were seasoned more. I thought it was seasoned perfectly, but I like vegetable dishes to be lightly seasoned to highlight the natural bitter flavors. The ambience is cozy and romantic, but we were seated in between two couples, and I felt we were competing with them so we could be heard. Overall, we ate a lovely meal in a lovely setting and would love to go again., The bar service seems pretentious (but also not so knowledgeable) and a bit unhelpful with regards to the dishes and drinks. In fact, it almost felt purposefully so. We asked for a drink and without asking for clarification she made a drink and when it wasn what we ordered we basically gave the response oh well. When asking for recommendations on entree she said everything from the pastas down on the menu is an entree. I will not be dining at this bar again and will choose other establishments like roses luxury or sona creamery, Great food great service. Had my boyfriends birthday dinner here and they accommodated me in every way. I would definitely go back! The roasted cauliflower is a must., Had dinner here for my friend because it was her birthday. She picked the place, Id never heard of it, but Im glad she did. It was a really great meal. Our party started with the chicken pate and the parker house rolls and the little poppyseed gougeres, which are little cheesy puff pastries. But where is this parker house and how do I get there? OMG! Anyway, for entrees we had either the bison flank steak or the artic char. All were great. I really like bison.. its super lean and a tad chewy because of it.. so just cut with the grain instead of against it and you will be fine. The bison was paired with beets. So good. We all had the baked bourbon hot chocolate, which is like a fancy little lava cake, for dessert. You cant go wrong with this one! Our server was Ivan and he was excellent.. he knew every ingredient at the top of his head and was ready with ideas for wine pairings. Garrison has a cool vibe yet isnt snooty., I feel very conflicted about Garrison. I went here with my boyfriend last night for dinner and it was a terrible experience. Then why the 3-star review you might ask? Well the food was wonderful and I feel that should be reflected in the review. However, the service was one of the worst Ive experienced in DC and kind of ruined the whole evening. He was extremely inattentive: tables in his section that were sat after us received their drinks and food before us although we ordered first and once we received our meals he never checked to see if everything came out alright (he asked for he other tables after ever course). It left both my boyfriend and myself feel rather frustrated with the entire experience and rather put out. Ive had a few friends recommend the Garrison, so Im wondering if it was just poor service. Either way, we dropped over $120 and both left feel dissatisfied. I think Ill keep my options open in Barracks Row., Almost there, but not quite. That is, this place has nearly all elements for a better review but it falls short on service.Came here for Sunday brunch. The food was lovely and the cinnamon raisin house-made toast was delicious. I like the cozy, trendy atmosphere and thought the food was well-presented. But the service was a bit--clumsy? Though friendly, they lacked the attentive and service-oriented attitude that would have given the experience one more star. Ill be exploring other spots before coming back. Not blown away, but not disappointed either., The food met expectations for the price points, nothing I wouldnt order again. The cauliflower and sweet potato tortellini were highlights. The tortellini was perfect. During the meal and after even today what I feel was a rare exception was the service that Moe provided. Communication was naturally professional...the kind where you feel like you are being serviced in a royal way yet still having personality. Recommendation were given, table maintenance was 10/10. Overall Moe and her back server provided one of the best service experiences Id had in several years...very refreshing., This pleasant restaurant is alright-ish. The space is nice, the service was good and the wine list included a good Rioja. The food, though, was bland. Began with the bison tartar, which was in need of some mustard or pickled vegetables, or even just salt, and some black pepper, to give it some zing. The entrees were both pastas - the farro cavatelli and the special ravioli. Both came over what I believe was a pea emulsion. The ravioli was fresh, but the dish overall was uninteresting. The broccoli that came with the cavatelli, which were like gnocchi, was charred with some hot pepper flakes which made it somewhat interesting. But not much more than what you might whip up at home on a Wednesday night. Considering how small the entrees were and their price, this was not a particularly good value evening out., Very so-so, especially considering all the hype. Service was subpar - started with being told we could be sat but needed to be out by a certain time. Ok sure, we didnt have reservations. Then when the server took our drink orders, he was pretty condescending to a pregnant person in the party who was trying to explore non-alcoholic drink options. He said they did not have any hot tea, but later when we received the dessert menu, a nice selection was clearly offered. The small plates, including cheese plate, arugula salad and fingerling potatoes were good, but the entire group had pasta entrees, and they were all pretty bad. The portion sizes were extremely small, but more importantly, they ranged from salty to bland to just not awesome. I would give it another try but my first impression is that its totally overrated and overpriced., Fantastic meal and service. It is rated 13 out of the top 100 restaurants in the DC area. It did not disappoint. Service was quick, meal was delightfully presented with powerful favors. The atmosphere was casual and pricing was as expected for the area and quality of food. Cant wait to return., Without a doubt, one of the best meals I have had in a few years. Nice combo of full service restaurant that is small enough to feel cozy and intimate. Service was perfect. Our group was a very discerning of foodies, and each of them loved the meal. Enough said., If you like fancy fois gras and the like, you may like this. The food was just OK in my book, and over priced for small portions. AND, on our night, we had a reservation at 5 pm, which also happens to be opening time. When the doors opened, staff seemed unprepared for the influx of people at one time. Our waiter - about 10 feet away from us and not knowing we wee watching - said is it 5 olock already? with a very annoyed look on his face as he glared at the customers walking in. Another waiter was bitching to a colleague in the kitchen, which is basically in the restaurant and 4 feet away from our table, then her alter ego came to the table and was Miss Pleasant. As a result, her kindness seemed fake since we saw her real personality come through as she bitched about her job. Even the manager/host seemed like he didn want to be there. All that said, the servers were very attentive and we left a big tip (which is what always do when waiters seem to judge me--to teach them a lesson about not judging I waited tables for 7 years). All in all, it was ok. But just not my favorite. For the price, I know I won go again., What Barracks Row doesnt need: another overpriced restaurant. Two cocktails, two modest size entrees, long waits for service, $100. Most of the menu items were just too precious for me (always some odd ingredient that sabotaged my interest in the dish). The dish I had (arctic char) was delicious, but the fish portion may not have even been 3 oz. and I left a little hungry. We were going to order dessert but after our dishes were cleared we were left alone for about 10 minutes, so the impulse passed., I never give negative review to a restaurant on Yelp unless I pay a second visit. In the case of Garrison on Barracks Row, the first visit was somethin of a disappointment but by no means disastrous. The idea of locally-sources ingredients was appealing and I was willing to overlook a few glitches. Besides, it was the first really balmy Spring night and I was feeling charitable. The glitch was the suspicion that the gin the bar was using was not as advertised. The gin-and-tonic was insipid and I suspected dilution or the substitution of cheap bar liquor for the Bombay.The second visit did not start out well. The serving staff seemed confused and disorganized. Drinks and appetizers were being delivered to the wrong tables. My second shot at a gin-and-tonic also turned out badly with a sinister black objects floating in the glass. The replacement drink was delivered to the table next to ours.I haven even gotten to the food. What can you say about a meal in which the best dish is the bread. The Parker House rolls were good but it was downhill after that. My hanger steak was, let say, arduous. I also asked for medium and got rare. It was run under the broiler again but came back as touch and unyielding as the first time around. My wife crispy-skin Arctic char was minuscule and inferior to farm-raised Atlantic salmon (she gave me a bite). Vegetable sides (roasted cauliflower, etc.) was thoroughly without distinction.High prices, sketchy service, sub-par food. I was generous in awarding the second star in the hope that Garrison might redeem itself, but for others, not for me.
26|hazel-washington|Hazel is a great eats in DC! The hubs and I were able to check this awesome restaurant out on their grand opening night to the public! Owned by Chef Rob Rubba and located in the Shaw neighborhood, the restaurant is named after his grandmother (I personally was just so excited for the English muffins)! They have a patio seating, but since it was still a little bit hot and muggy outside, we decided to dine indoors to be more comfortable. We ordered the following: the Crispy Chickpea (contained tofu, pickled cucumber, mint, and dressed in Szechuan lamb sauce - I wasnt really a fan of this dish, as it tasted like lightly-fried tofu, but not at all crispy; the lamb sauce was slightly gamey, and the dish wasnt that spicy, considering it had Szechuan influences); English Muffins (with whipped nouja, Greek yogurt, olive oil, jam, and lemon verbena - this was literally one of my most favorites! The English muffin was super delicious, as it had a nice flakey-/biscuit-like taste with a crisp edge; the spread was super tasty, as it was creamy and had a nice kick - the combination of all the ingredients were just superb!); Grandmas Zucchini Bread (slightly pan-fried, this came with a small jar of foie gras mousse, topped with chamomile gelee and bee pollen - the hubs was a total fan of this bread, as it was moist and almost dessert-like; the cold foie gras spread melted onto the bread nicely and was a nice complement); Gnocchi Bokki (gnocchi topped with pork-kimchi ragu, sesame seeds, and smoked pecorino; the gnocchi seemed to be overcooked and way too mushy; the pork was fork-tender and delicious, and the ragu sauce reminded me of a dwegi kimchi jjigae sauce; the pecorino was odd, as Im not a fan of cheese with Korean dishes); Sticky-Crunchy Ribs (topped with roasted peanuts and with a citrus glaze, I requested this dish to be without the cilantro (but, still came with (as a garnish, so it was just picked off))); the ribs had a thick syrupy coating on it and was okay); and, the Duck Duck dinner for two (the chef plans on keeping count, and we were his #1 order!!! - this came with mixed greens with a duck fat-sherry dressing (super fresh and light), Confit Fried Rice (super delicious! This had tender pieces of duck and the fried rice had a good sesame oil taste, topped with a scrambled egg (would have loved if it was sunny-side up!), Crispy Wings (duck wings that had a kochujang-type of sauce - they were crispy, but still thickly-coated), and a tray to make your own duck buns (with Peking style duck breast (tender and super flavorful, these were perfectly cooked), spiced sausage (had a strong all spice-like/Vietnamese-like flavor to it, but still tasty), various pickles (more sweet), buns, hoisin sauce, and the housemade hot sauce (in a cute bear-shaped squeeze bottle)). For dessert, we had the Black Sesame Panna Cotta and the Coconut Cheesecake - both were just okay. I loved our non-alcoholic beverages made with lemon and chicory from the bartender - super refreshing and had a lovely scent to it! Complimentary housemade rice crackers in a cute bag (handmade by the chefs wife) were served with a side of beet sauce - the sauce wasnt needed, but the rice crackers were tasty. Chefs Rubbas wife is Korean, so there are some Korean flavors in some of the dishes, such as using kimchi as their ingredient. The restaurant is dark, but designed well (cool collage mural, a divider using table legs, and customized lamps - the chef does have an art background!); the music playlist is pretty good, too! I love that they use lazy susans (in walnut, made by a NOVA-based Gulf War veteran for the restaurant). The staff were all super friendly and welcoming - our server, Christopher, was pretty awesome - he was super chill, laid back, attentive, and described each of the items well. There are some seasonal items on the menu, so Id love to see the ever-changing ones on my next visit. Just note that they do take reservations and are only opened for dinner! Limited metered-street parking around the area.+grand opening on 6/27!+lemon chicory drink :D+English Muffins :D :D :D+Confit Fried Rice :D :D :D+Grandmas Zucchini Bread+Duck Duck platter+shareable plates+great drinks by the barstaff :D+ask for Christopher :D+friendly staff :D+reservations accepted!+limited metered-street parking, I really loved this restaurant! Everything here is meant to be shared, so if you like big plates, you might want to pass. The interior is intricately decorated, down to the gorgeous tiling near the bar. There is also a funky patio, but the heatwave kept us from sitting outside. My friend and I ordered 2 cocktails to start. They were stiff--unlike some places in DC which charge 14 bucks for a weak cocktail. I really appreciated this! They also started us with some spicy rice chips on the house. We ordered the english muffins, the crispy chickpea tofu dish, and the branzino. The fish was delightful, but the english muffins stole the show. The Greek yogurt/lemon dip was incredible! It had a spicy kick which was complemented well by the tartness of the lemon. My only complaint was that they listed crispy chickpea under the vegetable section, so I didnt realize that it had meat in it. It was okay though, my friend had no problem polishing it off. Our server told us that they have a vegetarian chili that you can substitute, so thats good tip going forward., Checked out this new restaurant for dinner last night. Hazel specializes in seasonal small-plates; while they aren tapas sized plates, most are more appetizer sized. My friend and I ordered six plates and cocktails, which was enough food for us.The drinks are pricey, but unique and delicious. Too short a season is a great summer cocktail on a hot day; its not overly sweet with great orange flavor. Highly reccommend.For the food, we ordered the crispy chickpea tofu, grilled summer squash, peashoot salad, spiced duck sausage, zucchini bread, and english muffins. Our favorites were the salad, tofu, and the squash. The tofu and salad were probabaly the most memorable to me. The others were interesting, but just OK. I thought the english muffins were a letdown since the flavors didn really work for me.Anyway, the atmosphere and service is wonderful too. I look forward to coming back and sitting out on the patio., We arrived about 20 minutes early for our 7:30 reservation. Unfortunately they had had a power outage and did not have our reservation on file. Initially they told us it would be an hour and a half, but said they would try and get us in earlier. In the interim, they seated us outside on comfy couches and bought us a round of drinks. In the end we were seated at 7:22, 8 minutes ahead of our reservation. Our waitress, Jenn, could not have been lovelier. We wanted to do the chefs tasting menu, but my wife is a pescatarian and the chef said they could not accommodate that. Jenn ended up putting together a tasting off the menu, adjusting meaty sauces where possible and ended up giving us a bonus course that was delicious. She recommended delicious wines and was very generous with the pours. By meals end we were too full to even look at the dessert menu but she forced some yummy port on us, which was the perfect cap to an Amazing meal. Everyone involved at the restaurant helped turn what could have been a disappointing evening into one of our best dining experiences this year. We will definitely be back and will tell our friends. Cheers Hazel., Delightful! We sat on the terrace on a beautiful evening. Small plates that were the perfect size for an after movie snack. Flavors were complex and food was beautifully presented. Four stars until all of the staff is a little more familiar with the menu and drink menu. Well be back., Hazel is nothing less than exceptional. We went for a birthday dinner on a Thursday evening. We arrived early to sit at bar before our dinner. The hostess was so friendly and accomodating. She directed us to the bar and stated she would check back. Blake was the bartender. We tried several of their drinks listed on cocktail menu. Penpals was my favorite. They all were super strong and tasted wonderful. Blake did a wonderful job of explaining each drink and was super friendly..and cute too. The hostess came to get us to see if we were ready. We decided to have another drink. She was pleasant and said take our time. Never,ever felt rushed. She suggested a drink which my friend had. We got to our cute table. The wall with all the people on it was awesome. So many faces bringing back memories. Check out the lights over the bar..amazing. Great idea which I wont share here. Lots of light here. Too hot for outside patio but when fall areives,, we will be there. The food is small portions and perfect to share. We tried so many things. Soft shell crab was good. Seafood pancake was good but least favorite. The carrots were heavenly. Bbq y flavor was divine. The duck sausage was very flavorful. Loved the turnips. Gnocchi had wonderful flavor also. The ribs are dry rubbed then have a tempura batter...fall off the bone deliciousness found no where else. Trust me, you will be thinking about them for days and weeks to come. The zucchini bread with the foie grass is exceptional. Sweet bread and super moist. The grass has a pinch of sweetness from the bee poen but scrumptious. Dessert led us to coconut cheesecake and dark chocolate truffley thing. What a great birthday my friend enjoyed. They even gave him a card on the way out. Chris,our waiter, was informative and friendly. We enjoyed his service and knowledge. The bathrooms are super clean and neat decor. We will be back. We cant wait to try the ourside patio when weather is less hot and humid. Hazels is exceptional. Nothing should keep you from here. What a wonderful place., The steak tartar was beyond delicious, I almost came back for it again the next night. Loved the ambiance and the service was great. Our bartender Blake recommended an amazing Macedonian wine that blew my mind; I cant wait to go back! Oh, and the hot sauce? Prepare to worship the panda, Was pretty disappointing all around. Poor lighting, bad drinks, and only one of the four food plates I ordered did I find that great. Would not go back., Super friendly staff, great food and an awesome ambience! We had the crispy sweet pork ribs, chick pea tofu, pea shoot salad and shrimp-all amazing!, Hazel is a new addition to Shaw, with a beautiful patio and interior and a nice relaxing vibe. The restaurant has some issues, but I dont think I can give it anything less than 5 stars. Lets start with the bad. We had a 9:30 reservation on a Thursday. We came around 8:45 to see if we could be seated any earlier, and were told no (do they not hold any space for walk-ins?). We left and came back around 9:20 to wait. And we waited for a bit. Doesnt reservation mean youll be seated at that time (most places will hold your table for 10-15 minutes)? Thankfully the front of house manager knew what was going on and brought us some beers and a plate off of the menu to have while we waited. We were sat around 9:50. The service was also a little off. Our server didnt seem to know the menu all that well, slipping up on the ingredients of some dishes and descriptions. Also - in the middle of taking our drink order/giving us recommendations, he turned to another table and took drink orders? Very odd and we couldnt really believe what was happening at the time and still dont believe this would happen at a nicer restaurant.Anyway, on to the food. Every plate was executed very well (with the exception of the carrots). Flavors and combinations were unique, there were great textures and flavors, sizes were decent. Everything was on point.Favorite dishes*Duck - so good. The crispy legs and confit rice were amazing. The bao with sauces/pickles/kimchi was also good, and the duck sausage was probably my favorite bite of the night. The breast I thought couldve been sliced thicker, more juicy/tender, and less salty, but still good.*Sticky crunch ribs - great crunch, loved the glaze, peanuts, and cilantro, and these fell off the bone. Very good.*Crispy chickpea tofu - the tofu was not crispy, but still delicious. The lamb sauce had a little kick and great flavor.*English muffins - this was delicious. The spread of yogurt with whipped andouille sausage had a nice kick, and the lemon was a great touch. *Jasmine custard (or cream I cant remember) over dark chocolate ganache - this was a hit, everyone loved this dessert. *Spiced duck sausage - I think this was slightly different than the sausage served with the duck meal. It had some tasty turnips and a nice glaze/sauce on it. The good*Hamachi crudo - The fish tasted great and I loved the crispy rice to add texture, but overall a standard dish*Branzino - Also pretty standard, wish the skin was a little crispier, the avocado was a plain guac with hardboiled eggs in it (less fancy way of saying gribiche)*Zucchini bread with foie gras mousse - the bread itself was done very well and super moist, a little difficult to spread the mousse on. Didnt get much flavor from the mousse, but the dish was good. It was on the regular as well as dessert menu - we chose to have it for dessert.*Gnocchi - Didnt get as much flavor out of the ragu as I had hoped, and the gnocchi was huge/pretty soft. Wouldve liked more texture, it was like eating balls of mashed potatoes. The OKThe barbecued carrots were good but would not order these again. The thick slices of carrots were good but few, the shaved carrot was plain. The fennel kraut didnt have much flavor either.Oh also the panda sauce is really good. I thought about sneaking a bottle off, Everyone was really friendly and clearly knew the menu. Not your traditional choices, but the flavor were great. Really good cocktails. Tried the desert, but wasnt a complete fan. Prices are also responsible for the area. Definitely a nice place to go thats not too big., Hazel has a bit of a swanky feel to it as you walk in. The oversized couches are an interesting take. Inside is modern and stylish. The girlfriend and I decided on the chefs sampler menu. 7 courses for $48 a person inspired by the chef some favorites from the menu and whatever else he had decided on for the night. Course 1 I thought I was going to be writing a very different type of review. This dish was not for me at all. Im not a huge fan of tomatoes and this dish was nothing but tomatoes I took one bite and let the GF have the rest. Fortunately it got significantly better. The next dish was a hamachi crudo (side note: my girlfriend assures me this is the proper spelling so you can set your minds at ease). WOW the flavor was fantastic the best dish of the night and something I would come back specifically for. Next was a Korean pancake that was almost as good as the hamachi. The rest of the dinner included pastrami ribs, quail, bbq carrots, chickpeas with tofu, and dessert. Every dish was really good. Our server was amazing too if there was any knock on him it was that he might be almost too quick to pick up finished dishes/drinks. I really enjoyed this meal and Ill be back for sure, Mediocre at best! Wine list is very poor, had the duck-up, $50 dollars for the meal, left hungry and had to go next door to declaration to satisfy our appetite. They massacred the duck in every shape of form. The patio is lovely, the employees are lovely., Hazel is the newest restaurant from the Neighborhood Restaurant Group. In short, its awesome. The food is reasonably priced and flavorful. We got the seafood pancake, zucchini bread, branzino, octopus, carrots, ribs and gnocchi. The food came out at a great pace and each dish was enough for two people to share. The only thing I wasnt impressed with was the seafood pancake which was a little heavy and had too much seafood in each bite.Service was great. Waiters are casual and know the menu well. When our last dish took too long to come out our waiter brought out a complimentary last dish- the zucchini bread- to make up for it. The location is nice and the decor is cool. Patio option too.Drinks, especially the beer selection, are fantastic., Zucchini bread. But also, the service here was fantastic and they went out of the way to accommodate allergies. Also recommend the gnocchi, made with a tangy/acidic sauce. Could have lived without the tartare unfortunately-they have so many other innovative items that are worth trying, like the English muffins, Came here with my boyfriend and we had a great dinner at the bar- even on a weeknight reservations were hard to get. Service was great and as was food- my favorite was the steak tartar- it had Taylor tots with it! We also tried the seafood pancake (photo attached) but was a little too fishy for me. All and all, great place / only gave it four stars bc there are some other restaurants in DC that are just as Delish but give more for the same price point: tail up goat., Fantastic meal with great flavors and excellent service. Not only was each dish excellent, but the kitchen staged them in such a way that the flavors built upon one another and synergized across the meal. Highlights of the meal included te crispy chickpea tofu (the lamb sauce by itself could be an entire entree), the english muffins and the gnocchi, which are simply not to be missed., A must try. Really beautiful modern decor, and unique layout where you enter from the patio. Unique cocktails and great service. The hamachi with radishes is delicious. We also had the tofu with lamb sczechuan sauce, and gnocchi dumplings with korean pork ragu. I really want to go back and try more things! Nice looking out the window and seeing my favorite venue the 9:30 club across the street. Highly recommended., I loved the relaxed feel of this place - like a comfortable dining room in a friends home, or even grandmas house! The decor was well thought out and the concept of all the reclaimed wood and stair banisters really spoke to me. My party tried several menu items, such as the Lazy Susan duck style dishes, English muffins, steamed clams, steak tartare, branzino, and that zucchini bread was to die for with the foie gras mousse. Everyone loved zucchini bread. One thing to note is that I wish they couldve been a bit more inventive with the desert menu. But will definitely return to try more dishes!, Amazing !! I havent been to another restaurant like it in DC. A very cool vibe with an exciting menu and some wacky wines to top. Standouts: gnocchi bokki -korean italian Mashup was rich,spicy and unique.Crudo - the smoked yogurt sauce was a great addition to this fresh dish. The atmosphere is dark and chill. Loved the music go now!, We had a 5:45 reservation so it was a great excuse to get out of work early and head over to Shaw. The service was great and all the servers were extremely attentive and knowledgable about the menu. Our friends visited Hazel last month and enjoyed the 7-course tasting menu, so we were planning on trying that but unfortunately its not offered anymore. Regardless, we chose 5 dishes that worked out quite well for two people especially because the menu is presented in an organized manner that makes it easy to choose one or two from each section (vegetables, seafood, meat...). We got the Sweet Corn Donburi (the cheese was a little overpowering for our liking - our waiter actually recommended the tomato dish, which well try next time!), Zucchini Bread (just as good as everyone says - the mousse was flavorful and different, in a good way), the Hamachi Crudo which was one of our favorites - the yogurt was a great compliment to the fish, grilled Branzino, and the sticky-crunch ribs (another standout favorite). For dessert, we both got the watermelon basil sorbet, made in-house. Obviously, the food was fantastic and a little different than our usual meals. Other points for Hazel not directly tied to the meal itself: the font - the menu and website are presented in this beautiful font that Im enamored with, decor was great - the lighting wasnt too dark (although we were part of the early crew), and the patio looked fun as well. Overall, it was a fantastic experience and it reminded us of why DC is considered a foodie city., Wonderful spot. We sat outside and enjoyed a bunch of medium sized plates, from ribs to Hamachi to seafood pancakes. Just lovely. Send like a great place for groups to share a bunch of stuff. Would highly recommend if youre in that part of town., Absolutely blown away by Hazel. Excellent service, amazing food, reasonable prices. Hazel features medium plates which are perfect to share on a date. We had six plates between two of us, which was more than enough - we were stuffed by the end. We tried the biscuits, which were spicy yet smooth, the corn which was the dark horse and the surprise entr39e we liked the best, the grandmazucchini bread which melts in the mouth, the clams which was delicious but not a show stopper, the gnocci which was out of control - the pasta was so soft it was like mashed potatoes, and then the tofu with lamb sauce, which honestly was too intense and we were too full to try it. I wish they had a tasting menu so we could try more items - if you don like duck or fish the pre-fixed meal option youe out of luck, Although theres a lot of good food in DC, its rare to find a restaurant that really indulges in experimentation. Not so at Hazel, however, where the menu items are as varied as the flavors are delightful. This restaurant has no single theme, but all the dishes we tried--from the barbecued carrots to the crunchy ribs had us swooning.Likewise the space with its expansive patio, somewhat more upscale bar, and surprisingly low-key dining room, mixes styles and moods. Despite having a reservation, we stopped in at the bar for some yummy and equally inventive cocktails before requesting our table.And finally...the staff. What a friendly bunch. While most new DC restaurants try to project how cool/swank/sophisticated/hip/haute they are, Hazels staff seem to just be happy to be there...interacting with the guests, serving some astoundingly good food, and generally making their restaurant one of DCs best new dining experiences.I havent been this pleased with a first dining experience since Crane and Turtle opened back in 2014!, Left a message on their voicemail (had to, because I called three times during business hours and no one ever picked up) requesting to make a reservation for a birthday. On their vmail message, they say they will contact you in 24 hours. No one ever called me back. Very disappointing., I had been wanting to try Hazel for weeks now and finally decided to go on a rainy scheduled day. At 5:30 pm, I believe we were the first to get seated and were immediately welcomed by at least three friendly people. The door was held open for us as we walked in and were shown to our seats in the smaller dining room that leads between the one and only (?) entrance and kitchen. I call it the galley room. (As an aside, I wonder whether the windows open to the patio.)Midya was our server, and she was absolutely lovely and polite and wonderful. All night, she was smiley and attentive. She came by a couple of times to check on us and wasnt overbearing. In fact, the whole crew really worked as a team. When I got up to use the restroom, I was informed that another server came by to fold my napkin and take my umbrella. Water was refilled several times and our plates were cleared at appropriate times, in other words, not as soon as we pulled the last of the food off the plates. In terms of food, we opted to go big (or seemingly so, compared to other previous Yelpers and fellow diners last night). In order of appearance: Rice Crackers - hint of spice and nice welcoming touch served in a beautiful cloth containerHamachi Crudo - really could taste all the ingredients individually and in conjunction with each other; nice freshness of the hamachi, which is slightly meaty, but complimented by the crispy rice, lime, radish and hibiscus. The smoked yogurt tied everything together. Seafood Pancake - couldnt really discern chunks of shrimp or calamari but they were represented in subtleness, texture, and flavor. The Fire Panda worked well to kick up the heat just so and brought out the spring onion and garlic aioli.1/2 of Ducked Up! (Mixed Greens, Dumplings, Crispy Wings) - the greens were ok and in my opinion better eaten with the wings, which were true to form crispy. At this point, it felt like an encore of flavors in terms of spice. The dumplings were good, and I liked the filling but thought the outside was too crispy (several were cracked when they came to the table). Grandmas Zucchini Bread - the clear, overall winner of the night. I think the bread was grilled and buttered before it arrived. It tasted wonderful without being slathered to death by me with the foie gras mousse, chamomille gelee, and bee pollen, but man was that a show stopper combination. Enjoy some of the bread au naturel and some with the mousse. 1/2 of Ducked Up! (Peking Style Duck Breast, Kimchi-Confit Fried Rice) - I like the make your own sandwiches idea, and the second half of Ducked Up allowed me to do that with its soft pillowy baos, duck breast, pickles, kimchi, and I think hoisin sauce. The fried rice was a good fried rice but too salty (like many of the other dishes, but I generally find eating out too salty for me). For the medium size approach, it had a good representation of duck meat, eggs, and rice. Dark Chocolate Pave - disappointment in the end. I wanted something sweet to counter the salty dinner, and the cherry was too tart for me, and the pave was too dense and not light and sweet enough for me. I liked the music, the ambiance (although the tables were rather close - people moved tables to get in and out), and the service. I did not like feeling the door slam each and every time it opened (you might notice this when youre sitting in the galley room along the window/bench seating) and being short - changed. My dining companion noted that we didnt get duck sausage as part of the Ducked Up dinner like other Yelpers had posted., Overall, I was disappointed with this restaurant. The space is beautiful and the staff is friendly and inviting, but the food we tried was very mediocre in my opinion. The two dishes my friend and i were most excited about - the Zucchini Bread with Foie Gras and the Sticky Crunchy Ribs - were let downs. The Zucchini Bread with Foie Gras: Separately, the zucchini bread and the foie gras mousse were delicious, but together the sweetness and spices of the zucchini bread (theres a reason its also on the dessert menu) completely overpowered the foie gras. You really couldnt taste it at all. Im not sure why they dont serve the zucchini bread on its own and the foie gras with a more neutral tasting bread to really let it shine.Sticky Crunchy Ribs: We did not know that these ribs were coated in a thick tempura batter and deep fried when we ordered them. The first 5 bites I had were just breading. When I finally did get to the meat, it was tasty, but again completely overpowered but the oil soaked breading. My friend and I each ate 1 rib (after removing some of the coating) and decided that was enough.The other dishes we had were the Steak Tartare and Catfish Curry. The Steak Tartare was definitely the best thing we ate - it had a great combination of flavors and textures. The Catfish Curry was good but nothing worth coming back for. In summary, I would come back for drinks and to enjoy their lovely patio, but unless they revamp their menu Ill be dining elsewhere.
27|iron-gate-washington|Hard to review so early ... in that we went last night but they just opened ... but so far this was just A-OK.Don get me wrong ... this is a BEAUTIFUL restaurant ... a setting that truly takes you out of DC to a rustic cabin in Vermont. Very peaceful (although the fire was a bit hot) place to hang.The service was also EXCELLENT ... top notch ... attentive ... and they paced the meal quite well.Now, for the food ... we each got the six course tasting menu ... and youl note this is a tasting menu only kind of place.The plates were small and beautiful ... with exotic ingredients ... but nothing was great ... it was just all pretty good. I don believe I had one bite (like I did at Range or Casa Luca recently) where I said this makes me want to spend my good earned money or this is one of the best bites Ie ever had. We basically -- between the two of us -- had everything -- so it not an anomaly.Will I go back? Absolutely ... a real neat place ... but I won get back a second time if the food is still just ok.NOTE: I feel terrible writing this as I know this is such a big event for the team and Tony ... but I think his best work is ahead of him. I rooting for him., I dined there on a Sunday evening and had an overall great experience and great food. They have just recently opened -- or more accurately re-opened under new ownership/chef. Here are some thoughts:Atmosphere: Cozy, warm, old world feel. The entrance to the restaurant is set back a bit from the street. Lanterns light the path to entrance. From the entrance you walk past the narrow bar area which had a few tables and substantial bar space-- looks like it would be a nice place to pop in for a drink on a quiet night (not sure what food options they serve at the bar). Currently just the inside area is open. The bar area opens up into the outdoor/patio area which is currently not open (per their website it sounds like that will be open in spring -- from the peek I had it looks like it will be nice place to have outdoor meal and not be seated right off the street/sidewalk like you are in many DC restaurants with outdoor space). You walk through that outdoor area to get to a separate entrance that takes you to the main dining room. Cozy and candlelit, lots of exposed brick, with fireplace at one end. Service: Very good. Servers were prompt, courteous, and knowledgeable -- checked on you just enough to not be hovering too much. The inside menu is currently a tasting menu - -you select 4 or 6 course. There is an optional beverage pairing with the tasting. They give you about a half pour of a paired wine with each course with a lot of education on each (region where grown, how the drink will play off the food etc). I was there with my boyfriend, and since we each ordered different dishes there were different pairings, so that took a bit of time between courses for the schpeel and pouring. We enjoyed this, but it was a Sunday night and we had all the time for a longer dinner experience. If you just ordered off their extensive wine list, rather than pairing, I think the dining experience would be overall quicker -- so I would bear that in mind for parties larger than 2 or if you have plans after dinner. We were there for nearly 2 1/2 hours. Food: Now for what you really care about. The tasting menu starts with a taste of an assortment of bites selected by the chef --for the most part these were a true amuse bouche, with the exception of some focaccia bread and the burrata. All were pretty tasty--there was a pickled pepper I didn care for, but if you like hot peppers probably would enjoy. For the main tasting dishes I got a gnocchi with scallops that was spiced with saffron and ragu stuffed cannolini -- both were sizable for small plates and I enjoyed them but started to fill up. My boyfriend had the charred octopus, the veal sweetbreads, and the Lamb--the lamb plate was sizable and was served over a sausage and bean ragout. I tried everything of his but the octopus (just don personally care for; he enjoyed it)and all were tasty, perfectly cooked and seasoned well. I am forgetting exactly what the dessert was called that I had, but it was hazelnut and caramel and was very tasty and great end to a overall great meal. My boyfriend had the maple semifreddo with poached pear -- the presentation was really beautiful and I tried the semifreddo (I don like pears in general, but he really liked it). Overall, I recommend checking out Iron Gate for a nice dinner when you are in the mood for a real dining experience or for a special occasion. I think it may be difficult for a group larger than 4 people to tackle the tasting menu. Per the website, the outside menu will feature a lacarte items--- I am eager to return once the patio opens in Spring to check that out and will update this review., Stopped by the charmingly renovated Iron Gate for a drink. The lanterns along the walk way called us in. The new bar area is warm and friendly. We were happily given a tour and a view of the menu. I cannot wait to come here for dinner. The bar staff is knowledgable and friendly. This is my new favorite place. Look forward to spending time on the patio in warmer weather., Interesting menu with innovative flavors (***). Some items are better than others. Most appetizers were creative & cocktails were classy & flavorful, but the pastas were unimpressive.Fairly overpriced for what you get (hence docking the rating). Ambiance is pretty cool and service was fantastic. Id go there to try once, but wouldnt be a regular., Three of us came here for lunch today. I used to love the old Iron Gate. The positives are that they have nicely updated the bar area near the gate on N street. It is also heated though still quasi open aired. The old stable itself looks much the same, but some updating, particularly of the old booths, is an upgrade. We ordered the beet appetizer and moments later were informed that they were out of it. I ordered the pasta marinara as it was the only vegetarian dish to appeal to me (see the sparse lunch menu options) and one of my colleagues ordered the other (meaty) pasta dish. We were both later told that they were also out of the pasta dishes. I ended up with a sandwich with fried squash (I believe), apple and feta. It wasnt bad, but really not my speed. Since they were out of the beet appetizer, we ordered bread and three different types of dip. Two of the dips were tasty, though the olive dip was weak. We needed more bread for the dip and asked for it. Especially after their not having three items (on a lunch menu not exactly rife with options), we found it in poor taste that they charged us for extra bread for the dips. To their credit, they ended up delivering a small portion of the meaty pasta dish to go for my colleague. But charging for a small amount of bread left us with a bad taste in our mouth. I will go back, but Im going to wait to see if they get some of the early issues under control. 2.5 stars., Great experience from the minute we walked in till you walk out of the restaurant. First of all, my friend and I were trying to get a reservation for a table of 4 on Friday evening about a week before, only had 6:30pm and 9:15pm slots so we decided to try 6:30pm dining reservation. With Friday night traffic along with holiday traffic, we knew that we were going to be very late for that reservation. So we made a call to them around 6:20pm concerning that we were going to loose our chance to eat there. A lady who was on the other line said no problem, we will make a note that youe running behind. Ended up there around 8pm, I was sure that we lost our table and opportunity to dine there. They managed to clear and moved things around for us so we can still have dining table after 10minutes or so!We sat at this great table and the ambiance of this place is amazing! They first showed us their drink menu. I had one of their cocktail called Andiamo. And it was one of the best crafted cocktail Ie ever had. Then moved on to the food menu. I decided to try their 6 course menu with beverage pairing (it was wine pairing). Before they brought up the first course, they brought a few small plates for us to try. They were all excellent! Since I was very pleased by their cocktail I asked them who their mixologist was, not only they told us that the name of the mixologist, the guy took his time to come to our table to meet with us. What a pleasant experience that was!Then the whole meal that we had through out the menu was so good. We were so impressed by how wonderful the wine was with each course. Even the timing of the server to come back to clean up the table, to bring the next course was well-timed that I can remember the last time Ie had this pleasant experience with service at the restaurant before. I highly recommend everyone to experience dining here at least once. I know I will be going back there for sure. It was so worth it for us even with that annoying 2hrs traffic to get there!!, Went here for a special occasion dinner and was very pleased with the entire experience in the dining room. The service was attentive, but not intrusive. The space is warm and cozy. The food was delicious. We did the 6 course tasting menu and I enjoyed everything we ordered. My favorite course was probably the first with the homemade focaccia and small nibbles. The night we were there we had a cod cake, chicken liver on cracker, pickled egg and a fried cardoons with this delicious yogourt dipping sauce. Second favorite would likely be the lamb sampling for pastureWe didnt have a drink at the bar, but there were some tables in the bar for those without reservations. Id like to go back to try their a la carte menu. Will be going back for the patio when it opens. For anyone looking to have a nice night out and not totally break the bank, consider the 4 course option and buy a less expensive bottle of wine. It would still be special and more in budget., Great food, still working out the kinks in the serviceI was happy to see Iron Gate re-opened after three years closed. The inside has been completely refurbished, and is still dominated by dark wood and the central fireplace, but the surfaces are all new, and the ceiling height varies which helps with noise control. The menu is somewhat limited. You have a choice of a four-course or six-course tasting menu (no ala carte ordering) all from the same menu. There is no choice in appetizer, and you have six entrees and two deserts from which to choose. The menu is not too veggie-friendly, but the chef did make an effort to accommodate. Luckily for us we found delectable selections from among the few choices. Appetizers are two bites each, and there are many of them. Main courses are small-ish, but we were full by the time we had our two dishes, followed by a desert plate of five one-bite sweets (all good). The menu is innovative and leans toward the savory and well cooked. The wine list is large and the wine steward was knowledgeable. The wine prices are about what you would expect for a destination-type restaurant.The service was friendly, and there was plenty of help. The timing of dishes was odd, however, with some dishes coming while we were still eating, and a 30-minute pause between entree dishes. This could be because theyve only been open for three weeks, but one expects better at a restaurant of this caliber and in this price range. Speaking of which, our bill for two four-course choices and a bottle of wine was $240., Very impressed with the innovative food, ambiance, and service. We came here for our anniversary dinner. There was initially a mixup at the restaurant which had lost out reservation, but the ma3etre di resolved the issue quickly and sent over sparkling Greek wine to start the meal. We had the four course tasting menu with wine pairings. The pairings were spot on--three of the four were perfectly paired, and the wines were unique and off the beaten path. Very few standard grapes and varietals. The first course selection of appetizers from the seasonal grape and olive focaccia which was delightfully crispy without being too oily, and the pickled veggies, and wild mushroom saut39 with berry sauce and hazelnuts were fantastic. All the dishes were well composed and had interesting combinations of ingredients. The other standout dishes were the sea urchin, gnocchi (which was much more dense than I am used to) and seared scallop, paired with a very mineraly Greek white which was apparently stored underwater; and the Campari panna cotta with blood orange and other citrus. Id recommend this place for a special occasion/romantic dinner. I do wish they offered a two or three dish tasting as four was a little too epic. Given how overpriced DC fine dining can be, Iron Gate struck me as reasonable., This place rocks! Went here a couple weeks ago just to try out the bar and the guitar cut spaghetti was ridiculously tasty. The cocktails were really spot on as well. Then did the ultimate test and brought out of town guests to the dining room a week later to try the tasting menu. The service and food was as good as it gets in d.c. Not a cheap meal, but for amazing ambiance in a very old and cozy space that will be sure to impress even the most discriminating foodie, this place is worth putting on your top 5 list. We will defintely be returning for special occasions., We went here with a group comprised of vegetarians, vegans, and omnivores. The waitstaff/chef were very accommodating and everyone left happy. They even prepared a couple of special dishes for the vegan that the rest of us were quite envious of!The seating area was intimate and relaxing, and service was unobtrusive yet attentive. Overall, a very pleasant dining experience and a place we would recommend to almost anyone.Also I should note that, in addition to an extensive wine list, they also had a number of interesting beers available. I had an excellent Italian saison on tap., Came here twice in the span of two weeks - once for the a la carte menu, and once of the tasting menu. The restaurant hit it out of the park both times. Absolutely a great value for the price. If you havent checked it out - GO! Now! (before this place lands on all the bloggers best-of lists)The first time, we sat at the bar and ordered from the cafe menu. We left full, but not stuffed. Make sure to order to focaccia bread with olives. The cocktails left much to be desired, but the wine list was exceptional. Stick to the wine and youll be very very happy with your pairings. The second time, we did the six-course tasting menu WITH the porterhouse steak (added charge of $10 per person). The dining room was very cozy and romantic. The staff knew we were celebrating a special event and were incredibly courteous. The starter plates were very plentiful, main courses substantial, cheese course delectable, and desert inventive. My favorite were the crispy greek yeast doughnuts with orange blossom syrup. However, the staff seemed disorganized - incorrectly brining doubles of a dish to the same table instead of to the adjacent ones. *Pros*great value (reasonable prices)cozy atmosphere in the main dining roomamazing cheese coursethe desserts! order all of them!extensive drink menuinventive dishes*Cons*disappointing cocktail selectionstaff routinely brought the wrong dishes to the wrong tables.Verdict: you should go!, Great food, service and atmosphere. One of my favorite dining experiences in the 3 1/2 years Ive lived here. Cant wait to go back in the spring to sit in the courtyard., I dined at Iron Gate in the bar area last night and was disappointed with the dinner entrees. My friend and I ordered the chicken/sausage cannelloni and the scallops. The cannelloni wasnt like anything Ive tried before, and I dont mean that in a good way; it was more like a tuna casserole. The scallops were not fresh, but rather, they had a very fishy smell that was unsuccessfully covered by the strong rub that was added. The drinks, however, were good so Id only return to Iron Gate if I wasnt planning to dine there., My Fianc39 and I visited Iron Gate for a romantic dinner on a Thursday evening. Making a reservation was easy and seating was immediate. The dining room is cozy and very nicely done. The table spacing is good and the noise level low.We had the 4 item tasting menu at $50 per person. We werent sure if this would be enough food, but we neednt have worried. The food was plentiful and fantastic. Starting off with the olive focaccia, grilled sardine, beet salad, fennel salad, fish row with crackers, and pork terrine small plates to share. This was followed by two more individual portions each or fish and beef and followed by small desserts.We accompanied our meal with a fantastic Greek Bordeaux style red wine, recommended to us by the Sommelier (after asking what wines we liked and what we were looking at). The wine list is superb, very varied, well priced and with wines to suite every palate and wallet.The staff, especially our server Danielle, and Sommelier were superb and contributed to our fantastic evening.We loved our meal and our time at Iron Gate and hope to make monthly visits from now on. Highly recommended!, Nice atmosphere, generally friendly staff. However, if you sit at the bar, and other friends show up, make sure you are very clear about what goes on everyones check. Ended a good night in an incredibly awkward check splitting session, since the hipster bartender was too refined to ask people to open a tab and assumed we were picking it up for everyone., A beautiful, rustic setting, with friendly and attentive staff and good food. We went on a Wednesday night for the tasting menu. The food was very good--beet salad was exquisite, gnocchi with mushrooms were very very good (although the black truffle plentifully added for an extra 15 per person didnt really add much flavor--should have been sliced thinner might have been better if given a chance to warm up from the food). The small plates were interesting, some very good some not so special. Drink pairings were well done, but not spectacular. Four stars because the evening was a bit overpriced., This review is for the restaurant/tasting menu. My boyfriend had a birthday recently, and since we were planning to celebrate day of with his family, I asked to take him to dinner a few days earlier. I decided to surprise him with a visit here. We had attempted to grab a drink in the bar here one night, but it was so crowded that we gave up and went elsewhere, but I had been wanting to try it since reading great early reviews.We started with a round of Hang on St Christophers with rye, averna and maraschino liqueur. They were really wonderful, and perfect for a chilly evening. After that, they ascertain whether you want the 4 or 6 course tasting menu. Four courses was more than enough, and we ordered them with pairings (which was quite reasonably priced, especially given that they were very healthy pours and well-suited to the individual dishes). They asked if we had any diet restrictions and I said that neither of us cares for olives. She said she would skip bringing those out, and also see if she could find a different focaccia since the normal one was topped with them.The first course selection of appetizers. The focaccia was simply wonderful--crispy edges and the perfect density. The pickled veggies were also quite good. The wild mushrooms with hazelnuts were wonderful, as was the flavor-packed fish roe with crackers. I loved the beet and fennel salads, as well. Highlights of the meal were definitely the caramelized ricotta gnocchi with mushrooms, mascarpone and garlic bread crumbs, and the excellent veal sweetbreads. My boyfriend had never tried sweetbreads before, and these certainly sold him on them. We also had the garlic crusted rockfish, as well as the lamb. Both were flavorful and very well executed. We tried each of the desserts--a Campari panna cotta with crispy citrus, and the Gianuja terrine. Both were relatively small portions, but a very nice finish to a delightful meal. Although the wine list is reasonably priced, I think we did right by ordering their suggested pairings. However, I probably should not have had that much to drink :) I liked that most of them are available for sale at Planet Wine (out at Evening Star, part of their Restaurant Group).Service was attentive without being at all intrusive. They were friendly and knowledgeable, kept glasses full and plates cleared, and were happy to answer any questions we had. They were gracious about taking a photo, happy to write down the name of a wine we had liked, and generally made the meal much more enjoyable.The restaurant is absolutely lovely--cozy, intimate, quiet and warm (looking). It only looked warm--in reality, it was freezing inside (and outside--it was one of the coldest days we have had this winter). I was so cold that the waitress ended up offering to bring me a blanket for our corner table. I felt a bit foolish all bundled up, but it was necessary. I don know if there is any way they can remedy this, because it was by far my biggest complaint of the evening. No one wants to be so cold that they can enjoy their meal. But it was definitely a romantic dinner spot, and I love to return soon., Iron Gate would have been an ideal romantic setting for an intimate birthday celebration with my boyfriend, except that it was absurdly cold in the restaurant. If youre spending that much on dinner, you shouldnt need to keep your winter coat on, as every lady in the restaurant did. I dont care how old the building is (the excuse we were given), the problem needs to be fixed. Food was above average but not amazing and service was good. I will give it another try in the spring or fall when the patio is open., This review is mainly for the bar area:This location is a show-stopper.The cozy space heaters hanging overhead, the flames flickering against the walls, the giant mirror facing you straight on, the is this Height Act safe? tall ceilings. It all comes together and results in something pretty stunning. And this is just the bar.There is also a gorgeous courtyard with an ivy canopy. And past that is an intimate dining room with pastries on display and a warm fireplace. Il quit my gushing, but really, the ambiance of this place is just spectacular.The drinks are great too. I first discovered Iron Gate after following Jeff Faile and Bender (last name unknown) departure from my favorite Penn Quarter Italian water hole, Fiola, to their new digs. They haven skipped a beat. The service is always thoughtful and informed, and their drinks are just as good. Ie had countless Rittenhouse/Carpano Manhattans, but when I received one at Iron Gate it just tasted better than what I make at home. Maybe it the ambiance creeping into my drink. Or maybe it not. Either way it doesn matter. This place is a winner., Flew in from Seattle for one day to do a site visit. Had the best dinner, cocktail and dessert. Scallops were perfect on a warm spring evening, followed by the Greek donuts with orange blossom flower syrup. HEAVEN. I cant wait to go back in July for our event. The venue is so beautiful. You can feel the history and almost hear the walls telling you stories., I enjoyed my meal here but the portions are tiny. Recommend only going if youre not super hungry but are in the mood to try interesting flavor combinations and new takes on food.We ordered the 3 for $10 appetizers - burrata cheese with rhubarb which was fantastic! The mushrooms were good but a bit too salty and the aged tuna and egg which was really just tuna fish salad - avoid that one. The second dish we ordered was the panko breaded feta which was amazing! Highly recommend this dish! The wine selection is good but only if youre into reds...they didnt have any Rieslings or moscatos during our visit which was annoying. We also had the yogurt based cocktail which was interesting - not awful or particularly good but definitely an experience., Wow! This place is a hidden gem in Dupont. I give this place 4 stars just for their decor. The building itself is a stunner. Very intimate and romantic, but out-of-the-ordinary with open courtyards which lead into different dining rooms. We had the 6 course tasting menu with wine pairings. Overall, good food and attentive service. The meal started with a menagerie of tasting plates. Very nice touch and a fun way to start a meal. Afterward, we enjoyed the caramelized ricotta gnocchi, oak grilled sea scallop, pekin duck breast, chapel country bay blue cheese plate, and then the gianduju terrine (with hazelnut ice cream and caramel). My favorite was easily the duck breast. Don miss that one. The gianduju terrine was also very tasty.Pros:-Ambiance and beautiful building-Tasting menu is a fun way to dine...lots of flavors and options-Nice serviceCons:-Pricey-Credit card required to make a reservation-Wine pairings were mediocreRecommendations:-Make a reservation for date night-Don miss the duck breast-Take the metro to Dupont Circle. It is easier to walk from Dupont than to find free local parking. If you are okay with paying, the Tabard Inn has parking for $15., I really couldn be more disappointed with this restaurant. My party and I ordered from the tasting menu. I ordered the 4 course instead of the 6 course and got the gnocchi and the panna cotta, in addition to the mandatory seasonal sharing plates and dessert (which was the cheesecake).It took 40 minutes for my party to get the seasonal tastings. The seasonal tastings were just okay, but honestly nothing special. It then took about another 40 minutes for my party to get our next course, which for me, was the gnocchi. Ie had gnocchi at a lot of different restaurants and have even made my own on several occasions. This gnocchi basically just tasted like oil, which I assume was from the pesto that it was drenched in. It then took maybe an hour for my party to receive the third course, which was the panna cotta. This dish was just okay and was honestly too small. I understand it comes from the tasting menu, but the entire dish could be eaten with just two fork-fulls. And guess what? It took another hour for the dessert to come out. And this is just absurd because they only gave us two options for dessert -- one of them cheesecake and the other ice cream. Neither of these you can make right on the spot, so there is absolutely no reason why it should take this long. Overall, my party was at this restaurant for 3.5-4 hours. It was TOTALLY not worth the wait or the price., Im shocked by the mixed reviews of Iron Gate, but it seems like theres several different experiences based on when you come (brunch/dinner) and which tasting menu you go with. I can only speak for having done the Chefs Tasting menu on a Saturday night and it being one of the best meals Ive had in recent memory. Everything was delicious, service was spot on, the dining room is probably the most romantic in the entire city, and drinks were fine (nothing exceptional). But really a perfect meal for a date night (or birthday, in this case).I dont know if the chef does it for every chefs tasting, but the bone-in porterhouse steak we were served with ours (mediterranean flavored, served with some yogurt sauce) was one of the best tasting pieces of meat Ive had in a long time. I dont know how it was seasoned or prepared, but it was delicious -- you pulled pre-sliced bites right off the bone.All in all, Iron Gate is a gem of a place. They killed it with their renovation and when you enter, walk through the stone-bar area, into the outdoor foyer, and then into the carriage house dining room you definitely feel like youre submerging into a truly unique spot in DC. Highly recommend it for a special occasion., We had a lovely dinner in the beautiful garden. Tasty food in a light, romantic setting. It didnt start out very nice though. We were greeted with a set of rules around what we could eat where. If we wanted the tasting menu, wed have to sit inside. If we sat outside, we had limited menu choices. This was an extremely unwelcoming and really arrogant start to the evening. Its all from the same kitchen. Why not accommodate your guests first? Your list of rules at the start made me want to leave. Im glad I didnt. But I also wont be rushing back., Went there for lunch on a weekday with a couple of friends and we had a lovely experience! We were seated in the outside garden/courtyard, which is amazing.I had the campanelle pasta with spicy pork ragout and it was delicious. Good portion and really fresh. We had some of the seasonal ice creams and sorbets as dessert. The service was fast and friendly enough. I am not sure about dinner prices, but for lunch it was very reasonable, around 40$ per person with appetizers, entrees and 2 shared desserts. I cant really say anyting bad about this place. Definitely going back!, I sad to only give Iron Gate three stars, but I think it accurate based on the experience I had. To be more specific...My party of 4 got to the restaurant about an hour before our reservation and decided to have drinks at the bar. We snagged one of the last tables and admired the space - it pretty neat, especially considering it used to be a barn! To start, I ordered the Nicolaki cocktail. I loved the vodka and yogurt flavors - the drink was thick, creamy, and fresh (love the rosemary). My dining companions also reported enjoying their cocktails. We decided we had the munchies, so we ordered a house focaccia with caramelized onions, olives and tomatoes. It was really delicious - so delicious, in fact, that we ordered another one. Once the time for our reservation rolled around, we were led to the back of the restaurant (reservations are taken for the indoor dining room only). The indoor dining area is really lovely - lots of dark wood, very cozy. Since it was spring, the fire wasn going but I can see how that be gorgeous in the winter.We decided to go for the 4-course tasting menu each. For my meal, I decided to start with the gnocchi, then the softshell crab, then the scallop, and decided to substitute the cheese for a dessert. First, a number of tastes came out. There were olives, pickled vegetables, another(!) focaccia (we weren disappointed) among other goodies. These were excellent, I really enjoyed them. We also ordered a bottle of white wine since a bunch of us were getting seafood dishes. They have reasonably priced wine, which is nice.Then the main courses began to arrive. Now, let me say that everything was prepared beautifully and to my liking. The ingredients were very fresh and things were well executed. We also did not experience a super-long dinner (ours was maybe about 2, 2.5 hours, which I enjoyed - it was nice not to be rushed) as others have based on reviews Ie read. However, every course was TINY. For a four course menu, I expected more substantial portions. Now, I pretty small and don eat a ton of food, but even I would have liked to see more than one scallop for the scallop course (as an example). I remarked early on in the meal that the tasting menu was very reasonable $$-wise and now I think I know why - they feature really small portions. I think one of the reasons why I wasn hungry at the end of the meal was because of the 3 focaccias we had...but one of my dinner companions was DEFINITELY still hungry. Service was attentive and friendly, and they were able to answer all of our questions and the wine was refilled promptly, so no issues there.If the portions were a bit bigger, this would no doubt be a 4-star, maybe even closer to 5...but if a tasting menu leaves your dining companions hungry - and you think you weren hungry at the end just because you ate a lot of bread at the beginning - I just can justify more than 3 stars., We went here for a celebratory lunch and had a wonderful time. We were seated in the inside dining room, near the fireplace. Great architecture needed little additional decoration. The stone-topped tables fit in perfectly with the brick fireplace and ceiling beams. We shared the potato and dill fritters - fried, Yes, greasy, No. The black olive salad and Greek yoghurt provided the perfect salty and tangy counterpoint to the fritters. We also tried the dip trio: beet, kohlrabi and tadziki. Each tasted fresh and spiced just right, and the rainbow of colors really popped on the plate.My entree of crispy duck legs was cooked perfectly. I almost picked up the none to gnaw on it, but I was with my Mother so I didnt... My Mother had the guitar cut spaghetti pomodoro. The pasta was fresh and cooked precisely al dente. The fresh tomatoes flavor of the sauce was a refreshing change from jarred sauce. We enjoyed the fresh doughnuts in orange blossom syrup and also the rhubarb sorbet with anise pizelle for dessert. The service was just right, complete with trustworthy food recommendations and water refills at the right time. The hostess was friendly and set the right tone for the meal. We will be back!, This was one of the top 3 meals I have had in the city and definitely at the top of the list as one of my favorite restaurants now. The food here is super fresh and very inventive in a very old-world style setting. But only go here if you are a true foodie!My husband and I went there for a Sunday dinner with his parents to celebrate his birthday. The girls got the 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings and the guys got the 6 course tasting menu with pairings.All of the food was exceptional. My favorite dish of the evening was the one I expected to like the least and it was AMAZING - oak grilled scallop with cabbage tortellini. Yum!!! The sharing plates at the beginning of the meal were really unique and were the perfect way to start the meal.Everyone had bites of everyone elses plates throughout the meal and everything was absolutely delicious. Furthermore, the staff were super friendly and attentive. The MiL and I especially appreciated being given some heavy splashes of the 2 extra wine pairings that the guys had with their courses so that we wouldnt be left out!Altogether a really wonderful meal and I cant wait for another special occasion to go back here!, Lovely brunch outside in a charming courtyard with a good friend. For monthly girl chat with one of my friends, I decided on brunch at Iron Gate. It had gotten good reviews, seemed like a nice location and had a fantastic sounding egg, meat and cheese dish with tomatoes (all things I love). The space, as others have mentioned, is beautiful. There are tables out front, a gorgeous bar in the original passageway to the stables and the area in the back with the courtyard was completely charming. The waiter was kind and prompt, the water was constantly refilled. No complaints on the service front. One thing that was kind of strange though was that they put the check in this huge old cigar box. I got excited for a second, thinking that there was some dessert in there. Not to be. My friend got the chilled pea soup and the nutella and preserves with bread. One note on the bread: Its literally just charred pieces of bread with house-made nutella and preserves. She said it was excellent, but it was not what I was expecting (especially for the price). Her pea soup was very good as well. It was nice and bright (came with bread) and was served cool which was nice on a summer day. As alluded to above, I got the baked hen eggs, lamb & beef meatball and tomato with mozzarella. It came out in a little cast-iron skillet. It was overall very good, especially when I started mixing everything together. I had the fortunate (unfortunate?) experience of taking my first bit out of the warm mozzarella cheese, and that probably lessened my experience of the dish overall. One last thing to watch out for- the cotton napkins shed. A lot. There were little bits of lint floating all over the place and I thought it was pollen. But Im pretty sure it was just bits from the cotton napkins. Hopefully as they get watched a few more times, or change the lint filter in their washer and dryer, but I left with a newly decorated skirt in addition to my full stomach., This was one of the top 10 meals I have ever had! My mother was in town and I have been eager to try this place out so we went to give it a try on for dinner. As usual we had our restrictions as we do not eat ham. The service was phenomenal, we were well taken care of, our server was aware of our dietary restrictions and pointed out the only item in the menu we could not have. We went for the 4 course tasting menu, we each had a different plate and shared them, in theory we both tasted 8 dishes by the end of the night but werent uncomfortably full or bloated, we left feeling very light. The seasonal sharing plate included about six small items, none of which were included in the other dishes we ordered. It was so fresh and full of flavour. The garden seating looked so beautiful, wished we sat there. I will definitely come back very soon and try the garden menu., I have to say - I very disappointed with my dining experience at Iron Gate. I was there last night and it was one of the worst dining experiences Ie had in D.C. (and Ie been around the dining block). Our waitress was horrible, nay, atrocious. I sure she a decent human being, but apparently had some personal vendetta against our table for the evening. Throughout the meal, we had to ask for water 4 separate times. Our appetizer, the seasonal bites took 45 minutes to arrive (2 of them were served cold and the prosciutto tasted like turkey deli meat with some cranberries on top). Our waitress didn come over to check on us once during that time, but seemed to be happily flitting around at other tables in our vicinity. After we ordered another appetizer and a bottle of wine, the wine took another 20 minutes to arrive. By the time our entrees arrived - half of the bottle of wine was finished, partially because there was no water to drink, and partially because everything was moving at snails pace. I ordered the sausage, which came with two small pieces of focaccia toast and accompaniments. I wanted a few more slices of bread, and after being unable to catch the waitresses eye for 30 minutes, my unusually shy boyfriend had to raise his hand and say excuse me quite loudly to get her attention. Then, when the bread came, it was served as the focaccia appetizer, which I was notified came at an additional cost. So, not only had my sausages gone cold, but I was being charged for extra bread AND did not receive what I ordered. My bf ordered pasta which he said was tasty, but who knows. To top it all off, it was my boyfriend birthday! The only redeeming aspect of the meal was when they brought him a special birthday dessert - oh wait, that didn happen!! Nothing about this meal was redeeming. Save your money and go somewhere with better food and MUCH better service!, The Iron Gate is back and better than ever! Yes, Everyone favorite hidden garden in Dupont is back with a makeover, minor changes and finally a chef (Anthony Chittum) that is equal to the ambiance. The food here has always been vaguely eastern Mediterranean, but whereas before it leaned Lebanese, it now leans Greek, with a wine list to match.The entry (carriageway) to the former stables has now been enclosed and serves as the bar area. They have 30 or so bottled primarily craft beers (including Mythos from Greece), and another five on draft, (DC Brau, Sly Fox, etc), but surprisingly, none from their sister establishment, Bluejacket. The garden is as enchanting as ever with the huge grape vines trellised over the ample patio. As for the food, it is Greek/Italian-ish and not what you would find elsewhere. While it has appetizers, it not really a mezze place like Cava or Zaytinya. Instead, it follows a more traditional appetizers/pastas/mains format. We came for brunch one glorious June day and started with the toasted sourdough with homemade nutella and strawberry preserves and house made Greek yoghurt with candied pistachios and local honey. This was followed by gemelli pasta with braised rabbit, mustard and olives; an open faced lamb sandwich with provolone and green tomato relish; and baked eggs, beef and veal meatballs, tomato, and smoked mozzarella. While they were all good, for me, the standout dish was the pasta with rabbit; I could eat this over and over again.There wine list is almost exclusively Greek and Italian, with a whopping 30 selections by the glass, 1/3 of which are from the reserve list and go for $20-40 per glass! While the outdoor patio is a wonderful spot, I won hesitate to head back to the cozy dining room this winter., The atmosphere in the back of the restaurant is one of the best in DC, definitely recommended on a night with decent weather, 5/5; the service was good, 4.5/5; the cocktails were tasty, but expensive, 4/5; the food was OK, 3.5/5. We did the try all seasonal small plates option, plus the roast rabbit pasta main. The snow peas and ricotta, fried green tomatoes, and shrimp with salsa were our favorites. Some of the others were good, some were pretty plain. The pasta in the roast rabbit pasta dish was cooked perfectly, but the dish tasted like canned tuna with macaroni. My wife independently came to the same conclusion. We will definitely come back for the atmosphere., Im visiting the DC area from California, and was told to check out Iron Gate, which turned out to be an amazing dining experience! Not only was the food and ambiance outstanding, but my server, Forrest, took the experience to another level with his professionalism, knowledge and attentiveness. I manage a tasting room in San Francisco, and consider myself relatively knowledgeable when it comes to wine, but I will admit, Forrest blew me out of the water! I was so impressed with his pairing suggestions and his expertise on the extensive and complicated (in a good way!) wine list at Iron Gate. Like most exceptional servers, he knew the food menu like the back of his hand, but Im always impressed when a server is able to discuss the wines in detail as well, especially when the varietals are rare, imported wines. All in all, it was a highlight of my trip to DC and I recommend this to anyone looking to treat themselves to an incredible meal and dining experience., Fantastic place that is off the beaten path and a hidden gem. All the dishes were delicous. a+, Pretty upscale and pricey, an al carte menu is available for the outdoor area usually., Amazing! Everything is very good, the wine list is varied & the setting is very charming. I would highly recommend this restaurant., I was so excited to try IRON GATE. What follows is a review for:1. the setting2. the food3. the serviceThe setting is absolutely beautiful, especially if you reserve for the tasting menu, for which youe taken to a little building at the back. The courtyard looked just delightful. GREAT place for a date, special occasion, etc.The food, unfortunately, was not as spectacular as the setting. We tried the tasting menu, with the 6 courses, and were prepared to be wowed. So... course by course (August 2014 menu):Drinks - GREAT!Taste - an assortment of small dishes came out, and most of them were good, but only 2-3 were great. The focaccia, I wish, I could replicate at home. The pickled seasonal veggies were great. The broccolini was fantastic. Everything else.... just so so. I asked the waiter whether we were supposed to eat them in a particular order, hoping that we were supposed to build flavor on flavor, but alas, that wasn the case.Garden - Raviolini was good, with the walnut foam. Halloumi... wee had better.Water - the crab and the tuna were just so so.Pasture - lamb was great!Cheese - disappointing.Sweet - the kind soul next to us warned us against the Whitney Chocolate Terrine, since it was just too much chocolate. White chocolate (why ruin chocolate by bringing in white chocolate??), dark chocolate, milk chocolate, etc, was too much for her. SO, we went with the Poppy Seed Semolina Cake. The cake part was a bit dry. The summer berries were great. The BEST part of the dessert, though was the frozen yogurt. Wee not sure what made it so delicious, but it had an herbal aftertaste that was just spectacular. We asked the waiter, and he couldn tell us what was in it.Service, receives a split vote. Perhaps our waiter was distracted, but if someone asks you what is in this? and you don know, you go and ask the people who make it what in there to confirm.Also, be sure to confirm your reservations. I had had to move mine, and after a 5-minute discussion had agreed on a specific time. Then received a call to tell me that I had a reservation for lunch and not dinner. Umm... Fortunately the manager was able to resolve the issue and gave us a reservation and resolved the snafu.So overall, setting is great. Service and food are split., I had been waiting to try Iron Gate for some time now. Ive heard nothing but good things, thus my expectations were pretty high. Ended up being one of the best meals Ive had in the city. My date and I did the 6 course menu and we ordered drinks a la carte. The Nicolaki cocktail was amazing. Im not even sure how many dishes really came to our table, at least 20-25. It was a blast trying everything. Great use of local/season ingredients. I was fore-warned that most of the wait staff was new, but they did a great job and just need to build up some confidence. As someone that works in the industry I was very happy with my experience and Ill be back., Had a great experience here with the tasting menu. The waiter was super attentive and knowledgable. The food was amazing!! Would definitely recommend for a nice dinner. The tasting menu is served in the back room only, for the patio dinner there are lovely lights and vines to eat beneath with another menu., This is finally a restaurant that resists the big box feel of a lot of DC eateries, and instead focuses on small, well-designed spaces, and really flavorful, well-executed food. However, service could improve at every touch point.Ie been three times now, once for the formal tasting dinner, and twice for brunch on the patio:The formal tasting dinner was elegant and fun, and most of the dishes were worth the price tag. The sausage dish was a little underwhelming for me, but the cocktails were fantastic and creative, and the atmosphere is perfect for either a special date, or a place to take your well-groomed parents. Brunch on the patio is perfect for summer, and the leafy exterior creates a relaxing vibe that takes your brain out of the city. The dishes, especially the phylo, the lamb shoulder and the crackers were delicious, but the doughnuts and nutella were surprisingly disappointing. The Greek yogurt cocktail was balanced and fresh for summer.However, all three times, service was lacking. Though wait staff was always friendly, I often found myself looking around for more water or another cocktail, or something I asked for (orange juice) that I never received. Both times at brunch, I waited around 20 minutes to order. After brunch on Sunday, my friend and I headed to the bar for one last cocktail, and were ignored for a long time before we had to ask to order. Then, it was another 10 minutes for drinks, despite being the only two people at the bar.So beautiful space and good food for DC, but could benefit from more attentive service., I came here on a Sunday for brunch with my family, a delightful group of 9 all from out of town.The restaurants vibe was great. We sat outside in the back on a gorgeous morning. The garden was beautiful and Ive never seen such thick, winding tree branches. We started with the crispy Greek yeast doughnuts in orange blossom syrup. They were so incredible we asked for two more orders. I think over half of us ordered the fried eggs with Hen of the Woods mushrooms and it was a great decision. The eggs were fried perfectly and the crispy fingerling potatoes had a great seasoning. Id never had a Hen of the Woods mushrooms before so I was a bit skeptical of the name. There was no need since they were great. The service was a bit slow, but expected on a Sunday morning in June. Id definitely come back, especially to try the lamb sandwich., I came here for a late Sunday brunch and the food was SO delicious and such a beautiful day.The service was so bad we thought we were being punked. When we arrived on time for our reservation, the hostess told us the only available seating was at the bar and that we couldn have a table (despite our reservation). We thought she was telling us that the table was just not ready yet... but she actually clarified that we just couldn have a table. A few minutes later we saw a few groups leave and asked if we could now have a table.. and she sat us. No apologies. Weird?Our server was also hilariously rude. When we ordered something to start with he said maybe. Like he may or may not get it for us. I don think he said a positive thing the entire meal. Other than the comically unhelpful experience with the service -- the food was fantastic and garden area was beautiful. Hopefully we just caught everyone on a bad day and this isn the standard service., My husband and I went here recently and had the tasting menu with beverage pairings. I got the four plate tasting and my husband got the 6. First the service. The hostess was chilly and the waiter cut us off at first so I was worried but he gradually warmed up and did a very competent if not friendly job. The problem I had was the person who fills up the water glasses came around every ten minutes or so. So much so that I felt like I had to drink some water to give the poor guy something to do. It did intrude on our dinner a bit to be constantly interrupted by unnecessary water re-filling. They don charge for sparkling or still, which is so nice. We ate in the dining room which was very dark and we had some (not a ton) small bugs around the table all night. I think they came from the patio outside. My husband, who usually doesn notice the interior decorating of restaurants mentioned to me that he couldn figure out what kind of atmosphere they were trying to create in the restaurant. It definitely wasn upscale. There were no tablecloths and the anonymous family pictures and antiques sort of lend themselves to a family dining room sort of vibe. When I paying $300 for dinner for two I expect a little more. The patio looked like a much lovelier place to dine and as it was a perfect weather night I wish we were offered the option of eating the tasting menu on the patio.The food was either great, or really not very good. The taste course was fun. Lots of little things to try and everything was delicious. The grilled cheese under garden was a plastic blob of what tasted like Kraft mozzarella. I don know if it sat out too long but I was expecting something melty on the inside and crusty on the outside but it was cold and hard. Meanwhile, the goat cheese raviolini was fantastic. Under Water the good quality perfectly rare tuna was served over a very garlicky pureed eggplant that overcame the dish. It was supposed to come with local cherries and torn mint but they were indiscernible. The Pasture plate was lamb that my husband raved over. The most disappointing course was the cheese course. I was really looking forward to it as I had never had a formal cheese plate in a restaurant. What came out was a tiny slice of a meh cheese with radishes. Under sweet I ordered the chocolate torte on the menu that came with eggplant 2 ways. However, the dessert was a not very sweet or chocolatey layered eggplant dish, served stone cold. Meanwhile we scraped the plate of the roasted peaches.The wine pairings were Greek and Southern Italian wines that were good but not fantastic. After hearing about their wine list I was expecting at least a couple that wowed. I looked up the retail value of the wines and the retail value of the 1/2 glasses we got poured for 6 courses was between $10 and $12. The pourings tended to be on the 4 oz size instead of 5 oz as well.We did have a lovely time but for us this was a very special occasion and I would re-think some of the dishes on the menu., SALT! Way, way too much. In the focaccia. Way way too much in the mixed grill accompaniments. Way way too much in the sausage and potato dish. Way too much in the pasta. Call in the ambulance for the heart attack. And they even offered salted caramel ice cream aming the desserts. Great atmosphere, interesting wine list, pleasant service but a really a heavy hand with the salt shaker., Save your money and just go to the Tabard Inn. The Iron Gate is pathetic. I went there last night to celebrate a friends birthday. Right from the onset, we were met with lackluster service. The waiter was inattentive, spilled part of my friends $$$ drink on her and didnt even acknowledge it, took forever to bring my beer out to me and was MIA the whole night despite it being pretty dead last night. We each ordered appetizers that were ok-and very microscopic in size. We decided to share the mixed grill, which sounded amazing-a bunch of seafood on a platter. It was a small bowl of scallops, tuna and octopus which was not part of the the waiters description -- he mentioned shrimp. When we finally got his attention, he apologized and brought 4 puny shrimp out to placate us. The mixed grill came with sides of pesto, tapenade and pickled vegetables. I was starving and didnt want shell out money for another expensive platter-which was $34 a person. So I asked for another bowl of pickled vegetables and of course I was charged for it. Also one would think that at a pricey establishment such as the Iron Gate, they would provide you with bread or something at the start of the meal. No, sadly they didnt get this memo. Also, it was so strange that we get a side of tapenade and no bread or crackers to eat it with. My friend asked for bread and 15 minutes later, a plate of the sorriest looking sourdough appeared before us. Oh and guess what we were charged for the bread. Never. ever. again. I would rather save my money and go to the Tabard Inn or save that money for several trips to McDonalds-at least with McDonalds you will not leave hungry., On one hand, I really enjoyed our night out here in the casual portion of the restaurant (I have no opinion on the fine dining part). The back garden is beautiful, and there some great nerdy people watching, because everyone sitting around us appeared to be engaging in some kind of lobbying. I heard the words penetrate and munition a lot, for example. Plus, the food is tasty in a hard to pin down way; pretty well executed, pretty original, and pretty. Covering a slice of feta in sesame seeds and frying it is a neat idea. But I can never get over my problem with modern small plates tapas type restaurants. I never feel satisfied; I always feel like I spent too much; and I rather have more of what I like than little nibbles of it. It just frustrates me; so we left rather than lingered, and went to Shake Shack to finish off our meal.So, to channel Louis C.K., it a great place for the first leg of a tapas-burger bang-bang, but as a standalone destination, Iron Gate left me a little cold., A colleague recommended The Iron Gate as a great place to go for a special meal. He was absolutely right. We went on a Friday evening for my birthday dinner - me, my wife and my adult daughter. The ambiance is very nice - an old building with a lot of character. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. We were sat in a comfortable table in the inner dining room.The menu is very limited, with an emphasis on Greek cuisine and local sourcing. They serve either a four course meal or a six course meal, with a max of 2 choices for each course. We did the six course meal with wine pairings for each course. Every bit of food I put into my mouth was delicious. And the wine pairings were spot-on and delightful. The chef is hugely talented.The service was attentive and on the formal side, borderline stuffy. But this is not TGIFridays, so the formal service is what you get.Expensive. Dinner for 3 with the tip was just under $500. For most mortals, this isnt something you can do every night. But if youre willing to pay for a big night out, The Iron Gate is an outstanding choice., A friend and I ate here for lunch in September as our mutual birthday treat. We had high expectations based not only on Yelp and other online reviews but also on what looked like a great sharing/small plate menu. Unfortunately on the day we went, we were offered only a lunch menu and not the sharing/small plate menu that is currently on the website. We were disappointed not only in the service but also in the food. It was completely underwhelming.First issue -- I wanted coffee (not a latte or cappuccino) with half and half or cream. Well, the restaurant doesn have half and half or cream, and milk (especially skim or two percent) in coffee doesn appeal to me at all. One would think a good restaurant would stock cream or half and half as a matter of course. So I asked for black tea instead. The server couldn find anything as basic as a straightforward black tea, so I had blackberry-flavored black tea. Not good. Stocking a decent, unflavored black tea shouldn be too difficult, even if it just a tea bag rather than looseleaf tea.Second issue -- my friend and I asked to share a salad that ordinarily comes with a bagna cauda dresssing. Since neither of us cares for anchovies, we asked for a substitution on the dressing, and made clear to the server that we wanted a different dressing because we don like anchovies. The salad came with a balsamic vinaigrette, no problem, and split on two plates, fine -- and each plate was garnished with an anchovy-wrapped garlic clove. Ugh. Moreover, the farm egg touted on the menu was 1/4 egg per plate with an extremely unappetizing green-rimmed yolk. It shouldn be that hard for a top-rated kitchen to figure out how to boil an egg without overcooking it so that it doesn become discolored. We ordered chicken with the salad, which turned out to be boiled and shredded in uneven chunks, many with tendons still attached -- extremely unappetizing and almost flavorless. It didn even come with the salad -- we had to remind our server. Seriously one of the most overpriced and worst constructed salads ever.Third issue -- we both ordered the gnocchi. Big mistake. They were heavy and leaden with a sauce that tasted like it came out of a jar. Ie had better gnocchi from the freezer section of Trader Joe, and better sauces, too.Final issue -- we ordered a cookie plate to split for dessert. It had two cookies each of five varieties, perfect for sharing. Unfortunately several of the cookies were visibly overbaked and never should have been plated in the first instance -- it was easy to tell they were overdone and if not burned crisped to the point of inedibility.Reading all the great reviews, I wondering how my friend and I could have experienced such a different restaurant than others have, but sadly it was not worth the $40 for lunch per person (and that with shared salad and dessert) and I not inclined to give it a try for dinner, either., One of the best meals Ive had in DC recently! I enjoyed a lovely birthday dinner here and cant decide what I liked most: the romantic ambiance, the inventive (and tasty) food, or the servers who all worked so well together as a team. I appreciated that you could choose the number of courses on the tasting menu that you wanted, and you could even choose among different categories. The seasonal sharing plate provided a fun mix of tastes, and each course got better from there! The wine list was also very unique (Mediterranean-inspired - reminded me a bit of the Zaytinya wine list). Great food, ambiance, and service!, You enter off the street and are transported to another time. The room has a sense of age that comforting and it even smells comfortable, if that makes sense. At the bar, creative cocktails to start. I had dinner in the tasting room and Chef Tony Chittum multicourse menu was spectacular. Start with several shared small Tastes and construct a 4 or 6 course meal. Everything was beautifully presented and delicious. Service was perfect and the wine list well chosen, interesting and well priced. Next time, I want to try the more casual and rustic a la carte menu in the front room, but I will most definitely be back for the tasting menu again. Ie only tried a few of the options and others beckon., We came here for dinner when visiting my best friend in DC. The food and wine were amazing the tapas selections were amazing. Connor our server was very instrumental in selecting the dishes. We ordered two of everything. You can order anything on the menu and you wont be disappointed., Excellent place. Relatively new, but an awesome space - bar, patio, and main restaurant. Highly recommend the tasting menu, which is delicious. Its a pretty unique dining experience in DC, and definitely worth it while its on the pricier side. Need to go back for the regular menu and sit on the patio..., I dont know what I loved the most -- the atmosphere is phenomenal with a warm candle-lit glow. For our 2 year anniversary, we sat in the dining room, which had a fire burning and a low buzz of conversation. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly, and after some discussion picked the 6-course tasting menu to get a good breadth of their samplings. Because we were two people, we picked one of each thing on the menu. Instead of going for a wine pairings (which were $50 per person -- and too much alcohol for a Monday night), we selected a bottle of Nebbiolo which ran about $70. The wine was fantastic and a good deal relative to the wine pairing price.We also saw an orange wine on their menu (as opposed to rose, white or red). The waiter explained it was an oxidized white and even offered us a free glass to try. It was certainly not my style (too sour/yeasty tasting) but I appreciated that he provided it to us.The food was out of this world -- some of the best Ive had in my years in DC. In addition to there simply being tons of it, I can honestly say there wasnt anything I didnt enjoy. While it may have been too much food, Im glad we didnt stick to the 4-course because there was nothing I wouldve wanted to cut from the menu. While it is not inexpensive, the quality and quantity of food makes you feel like youre getting your moneys worth. We were stuffed by the end of the night.Overall, I would highly recommend the dining room and tasting menu for special occasions, when you need to impress, or when your parents are in town and theyre footing the bill. The table next to us got the chefs tasting menu, which looked great as well but was a little outside our price range.Im excited to return and sit in the carriage way (which has a separate, really cool vibe), order a glass of good wine, and sample ala carte from their bar menu. It is practically a different experience.One heads up -- the 6 course took almost 3 hours., Went to the Iron Gate last night for dinner. Beautiful restaurant with a great patio.. awesome ambience. Nice place to go just for drinks at the bar. But the good stuff stops there. The service was slow, unfriendly and not overly anxious to help. We had to ask someone to bring menus and take an order for drinks. Some dishes were outstanding (swordfish meatballs) and some dishes were really bad (under cooked scallops). The timing at which they brought out the dishes was completely off. The Manager was nice enough to comp our drinks, and of course, the undercooked scallops!, Wow!....That pretty much sums up our experience. My husband surprised me with a special birthday dinner at Iron Gate. We are a very tight family -- and also lazy about getting a babysitter -- so our 8-year-old daughter accompanied us for an early Sunday dinner. Here are the reasons for my 5-star rating:1. Accommodations: I have dairy and egg allergies but the chef was able to accommodate my dietary needs while still meeting my expectations of a tasting menu. In fact, it was one of the best restaurant meals Ive had in a long time. They also accommodated our daughter with a pasta dish, allowed her to have my cheese course, and treated her to a special dessert.2. Phenomenal food: Is easy to find tasty and appetizing food in DC. To win me over, the food has to be unique and provide an experience unlike any other and I felt like Iron Gate achieved this. And Ive been to most of the tasting rooms in the city (Citronelle, CityZen, Restaurant Eve, Inn at LW). 3. Atmosphere: Despite the elevated food and prices and typical formality of a tasting room, the restaurant feels cozy and intimate. We felt comfortable and didnt feel like we had to act a certain way because were paying 5x more for dinner., My wife and I were excited to try out a new finer dining establishment, but Iron Gate let us down from start to finish. The bar wasnt even crowded for pre-dinner drinks but the one bartender couldnt keep up and we waited a good 20 minutes for one drink each. Dinner was an absolute train wreck. We were seated and then waited 20 minutes to see a waiter. Despite initial misgivings, we did the full tasting menu with pairings (one of each option down the menu). First, the shot-gun approach to appetizers (i.e., the small seasonal plates) was weird. Many of the small plates did not work together and the wine pairing fell flat with all but one of the five options. I did love the bread, though, as well as the carrot and beat plates.The salad course was OK and the wines paired pretty well with the food. I just about lost it, though, when they paired the seafood stew with a sweet Greek fortified wine reminiscent of Madeira (i.e., a desert wine). The striploin was a bright spot and paired nicely with the wine, but the pork belly lacked taste and was overshadowed by the cannelloni on top and a wine pairing that did not work. Desert was OK, but Iron Gate destroyed our final memory of the place with a dried out small desert offering that came out with the check. I think it was supposed to be something like a ginger snap, but it was bland and reminded me more of a dog treat or something.A real quick note on the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde wine pairings here. A few worked marvelously while others were completely out of tune with the dish. Im not sure if Iron Gate ran out of wines they originally intended to pair with certain dishes, or if the person pairing the wines has an inconsistent pallet. Also, while I realize that Greek wine can be tough some times, a few they served had to be taken with food as they did not smell/taste good on their own. In my experience, truly good wine works on its own or with food and a nice bouquet goes a long way when you have a sip right before your first bite of a dish. In sum, Im all for paying good money for good food, wine, and service, but this was a miss on all fronts for us. There are just too many other good places in DC to waste time here., The service made me nervous. Our waiter (waitressman?) kept giving speeches about the menu to every table around us. Youd think there would be a way to boil down the information to the guest without having to present a 5 minute speech to each table regarding what a small plate is, what family style is, etc, etc. Every second we were there, our waiter could be heard giving these goddamned speeches to tables. It was so distracting and since each speech takes up a significant portion of time, we were without drink refills, water refills, or bussed plates. Incredibly, a busboy asked my wife if she was done with the beet dip, while he pointed to a plate completely empty and clean as though it were licked. No, were still working on it, come back when shes finished gnawing off the porcelain. Food was outstanding.
28|izakaya-seki-washington|This is the first place in DC that Ive seen bukkake on the menu. Thats pretty unique, if nothing else.(Although at just $12 for a whole bowl of it I think those Japanese fanatics have been overpaying all those years.), I had high hopes - I really did. The decor is simple and efficient - and the menu was adventurous (at least for a DC crowd). But like all things, the devils are in the execution. Id recommend coming back in two months after theyve worked out their kinks.The meal began with the Hokkaido scallop carpaccio. The focus should be on the scallops, but the thick yuzu completely drowned out my circular white delicious friends. A waste of fresh scallops.Thankfully, the next dish, the Hamachi Kama (yellow tail jawbone), redeemed the scallops. Not the usual choice for those not familiar with the anatomy of the fish, but its well worth it. The jaw was perfectly cooked - tendered throughout, but not overdone. There was a lot of meat and the meat retained the appropriate amount of juiciness underneath the taut, crispy skins.Next up, tempura special and renkon mochi (lotus root mochi in broth). Tempura was good - pretty standard. The breading was right and the veggies were diverse (okra, string beans, squash, etc.). The sauce was just the right level of saltiness. The renkon mochi was... mushy. It was tasty, but not the texture I would have expected. Seems like they breaded the lotus root in mochi flour, fried it, and dipped it in a chicken broth. The taste was good, but the texture is odd. Maybe it was sitting in the broth a bit too long before they brought it out. If it was crispier, it would have been just right. To close the meal, we had the cold soba. It was soba and it was cold. It was also wet, too wet. It also lacked the buckwheat or matcha flavors that make sobadance on my tongue. The texture was right, but the flavor is just not there.So our meal overall was mehh. That being said, we might have ordered the wrong dishes. The tables next to us had what looked like a perfectly grilled mero (thick and pearl white), a decent sized uni starter, and delicious looking sashmi special (bright thick pieces that looked pretty fresh). If i were to go back, I would probably stick with the grill dishes and add the rice or soba as a filler. For a restaurant this price, I expected better., The quality of the food was high, but the portions were very small and seemed overpriced. We ordered the uni starter, roasted mushrooms, rice balls with salted cod, and chicken tenders with wasabi. The rice balls and the mushrooms were my favorite -- both very flavorful and nice portions (not too big, but not too small). The uni starter was basically a pile of uni in a tiny cup. Although it tasted good, I dont think it was worth $15. The chicken tenders were nothing like I expected. They were two pieces of grilled chicken on a skewer with a cream sauce that didnt taste much like wasabi. I wouldnt order that again. This was the restaurants second night, so Im sure theyre still working out the kinks., Almost, almost 5 stars!I went on Izakaya Sekis 4th day of being open, so the main reason for the 1-star deduction is due to newbie kinks that I think will be worked out after a month. There were just a few small things like the waiter not knowing all the menu items, items being mis-labeled, the waiter bringing the wrong app (which was a happy accident). That being said, when there was a menu error, the staff was quick to correct the mistake and not charge for it. So theres potential! But the food was spot-on - great flavors and a creative menu. My fav was the kyona salad which was like a flavor-party in my mouth. Plus, you know its a good sign when at a Japanese restaurant that theres Japanese speakers sitting next to you. Do be advised that dinner was a bit more expensive than I had expected - make sure to review the alcohol prices, it looks like Sake is the best option price-wise. Overall, I will definitely be back in the coming months!, This is not a cuisine Ive tried a lot, so I am not an excellent judge, but to me the fried eggplant dish alone is worth the trip. Beautiful decor too. Loved their enthusiasm (evident even in the menu) to get you to try something new, like some tasty Japanese microbrews., We were seated right in front of Chef Seki at the ground floor counter and decided that we had the best seats in the house. To be able to see him put together beautifully simple dishes with a gentle touch made our already delicious food taste even better. You know how when something is made with love, it tastes even better? It like that.I had my reservations (not *a* reservation - those are not accepted) about Izakaya Seki after being disappointed by high-ceilinged, trendy Kushi. But after entering through the almost indistinguishable door into a bare white room with almost no decor, I knew that this place is all about the food.We started off with the sashimi special, which was yellowtail (my favorite) that night. The fish and the garnish together was delicious and wonderful. Next we were served the kyona salad, which made us the envy of our corner of the room. The salad is a mix of unique greens tossed in an impossibly light dressing, then topped with tuna flakes. What pushed this dish over the top was the onsen egg, a slow-poached egg, which was lightly beaten by our server and then placed on top of the salad. It was a thing to behold.Next came the skate with sweet soy. I thought I had skate before, but I had no idea it was a cousin of the shark! Sorry little buddy, but we ate you and enjoyed it! It is a pretty interesting fish, especially because the flesh had a distinctly crab-like texture. Not for everyone.After that came the fried goodness. We ordered the cream croquettes with bechamel, crab and corn (could there be a better combination?), which were sinfully creamy. The kushikatsu was deep fried pork belly and onion on a skewer. Some of the meat was a bit on the chewy side, but overall it was pretty good. We ended our meal with warm udon. This is not your ordinary udon with noodles as thick as baby fingers and a generic broth. The noodles here were only about twice as thick as spaghetti and had a very nice chew, characteristic of handmade noodles (but probably not handmade, which is fine). It was topped with tuna flakes again, but also crispy tempura flakes which really made this dish sing. The broth was fabulous.We ordered six dishes for two people and left very satisfied for $62. Some other reviews complain about the price, but I thought it was a pretty good value. Kushi is definitely more expensive.A few notes: - This place is getting pop-u-lar. By 7:30 on a crazy rainy Saturday night, they already had a 30-45 minute wait. By 8:00, it was more than an hour, so plan ahead. - Also, like I mentioned earlier, the door isn easy to spot from far away, but if you know where youe going, youl be fine. - I overheard the staff telling people that they only take reservations for parties of 8 or more, but that this policy may change. They may get rid of reservations altogether.- Lastly, try to sit at the bar! The stools are far from comfortable, but you really wanna see Chef Seki at work and interacting with his customers. To the Seki family, thank you for Izakaya Seki! This kind of casual, neighborhood izakaya with focus on quality of food and drink is a place that DC has lacked until you came along. Please don ever change!, This is only the second review I write on yelp but I am so enthusiastic about Izakaya Seki that I want to share it!I am very very happy with this place, which opened two blocks from home, and I am longing for their tsukune and uni dish already. Ive been looking for good tsukune (chicken meat balls) for a long time and knew the minute I tasted it that I would get a second order.We went there with a Japanese friend, thanks to whom we made some choices I wouldnt have considered. The salad we got was excellent, as was the grilled fish. The only thing keeping me away from that fifth star is the price. A bit too high for some dishes., So very happy to welcome an authentic Japanese restaurant to the U Street neighborhood. Its run by a father and daughter team and they have really put lots of love and hard work to make this offbeat townhouse location a little oasis of Japanese calm.Their raw fish was incredibly fresh, if the uni sashimi (served with quail yolk and julienned shiso leaf) is representative. But the best dishes were the pig trotters (if your last sampling of pig trotters was at the Florida Avenue Grill around the corner, this dish is very different), the grilled and braised beef tongue, and the homemade half-sour mackerel. As for drinks, they made my 5 year old son happy by serving him his favorite Calpico, and I had my Oolong tea shochu cocktail. It isnt quite up to the haute cuisine standards of Sushi Taro, but then Sushi Taro is an expense account restaurant and the best in town. Izakaya Seki is a home away from home for this expat., Expensive? Yes, just like pretty much every other decent DC restaurant.This restaurant is about as authentically Japanese as you can get - from the super simple decor to the Japanese father daughter team to the awesome menu. I love that they didnt shy away from some dishes that are so popular in Japan that other Japanese restaurants in DC were probably too afraid to put on their menu (i.e. monkfish liver, beef tongue, pork trotter, yellow tail jaw). All the dishes we had were spot on compared to what Ive had in Japan and to my moms cooking.They also have a good selection of sake, shochu, and Japanese beers., My French BF and I eat Japanese in Paris quite a bit so we are spoiled when i comes to varied menus of high quality dishes. Izakaya Seki did not disappoint us . The ambiance was inviting and the service attentive and relaxed. The shashimi sampler we shared was a generous assortment and of superb quality, and sharing it left room for other delights, most notably the daikon salad as well as the seaweed / fishcake salad. Cream cheese tofu and cold soba noodles were quite good. Well be back for the pig trotters and the spare ribs.., For quite some time, Ive been looking forward to the opening of Izakaya Seki, a Japanese restaurant located near V St. and 12th NW. It finally opened a couple weeks ago, so my wife and I went down to check it out. Its definitely a cute little space; if they offered happy hour specials, I might swing by after work, and it look like itd be nice for an early date. Downstairs, they have bar-style seating, and upstairs they have table seating.The menu is small plates, and its focused more on Japanese pub food rather than on sushi. In fact, there are only a few sushi dishes on their menu, and no rolls. On the other hand, they have a rather extensive list of sake and shochu, so theres that. We ordered the Sashimi Special, the Uni starter, the Kushikatsu (deep-fried pork belly), and the Kyona salad (arugula-based). We both agreed that the Kyona salad was the best of the dishes. It was fresh and bright, but the egg and tuna shavings gave it a nice savoriness as well. The pork belly, on the other hand, was the worst. Underneath all the breading, you could barely taste the pork belly, and it was seriously chewy. The sashimi and the uni were both above average, but somewhat expensive, even for the fairly large quantity you got. The selection was good, with tuna, octopus, squid, yellowtail, flounder, and shrimp. The octopus was a highlight, beautifully tender, and the shrimp melted in your mouth.The service was attentive, if not especially knowledgeable. We both enjoyed it, and will probably go back since its right in our neighborhood, but there are probably better places for izakaya-style eating in DC., I was visiting DC and a friend took me to Izakaya Seki. I had never had (or really heard of) Izakaya-style dining, and I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. Awesome drink options (we mixed it up with some whiskey, and then shochu), and I appreciated the variety on the menu - everything from fried goodness to fresh seafood to delicious rice balls. Service was great, and the general buzz of the restaurant was really fun. This will definitely be a stop on future visits!, I had the tempura, which is consistently well done. The selection of sake is the best in the city.Vegetarian alert: what they mark as vegetarian, the rest of us call pescatarian (aka fishetarian). If I recall correctly, the menu lists tuna shavings as veg. The tempura batter has bonito flakes in it. So tell them `Im vegetarian when you order, then confirm after they serve you, `does this have fish in it? and you should get by OK.And no, this is not a translation issue: I cant speak for all of them, but Japanese Buddhists are typically veg, not pescetarian, Lets be honest, I was a little intimidated by the authenticity of Izakaya Sekis menu. This is not some overly Americanized Japanese place. But man is it good! I had the fried chicken dish, a pork and mustard dish, fried rice, and some other stuff I cant remember. All of it was amazing--just unfamiliar enough to be fun but familiar enough to be comfortable. I loved it. To top it off, my friend left his credit card on the table, and as we walked out our waitress ran--yes, literally ran--after us to make sure we got his card back. That kind of service alone deserves five stars. Eat here., I loved the intimate atmosphere of this restaurant, but the food just didn impress me that much. The uni starter that I was served had the shiso leaf on the bottom of the bowl, instead of julienned (like a previous reviewer mentioned). While this presentation allowed for an efficient way to clean my plate in one fell swoop by shoving into my mouth a crumpled leaf with the last remnants of uni, the previous bites of uni and quail egg weren spectacular. Maybe it was just too much uni at one time; maybe there should have been an additional half shiso leaf julienned into the mix; or maybe it was just the difficulty of picking up the slimy mixture with chopsticks. The other dish I ordered, a rice ball with cod roe, was equally unimpressive. I used to rice balls being cute little things (just google rice balls for images), but this rice ball looked like it was slopped together by someone who was more concerned with just getting it out of the kitchen. While the food wasn the greatest, our waitress was wonderful and picked out a citrus shochu for us to share. I will definitely come back to try other menu items, but this first experience was unfortunately, less than I expected., Ate here on 9/10/12! Great food and service. My only worry is this small well kept secret wont last long!, Finally! An authentic mom and pop (in this case pop and daughter) Japanese diner in the greater DC area! Being a Japanese culture enthusiast, I came here almost as soon as I heard about this place for dinner with friends.I spoke Japanese with the waitress, so I knew this place was completely legit in its Japanese authenticity. My friends didn know I speak it and were shocked...lol. I tried some standard Japanese fare: onigiri, kakiage, karaage, and the assorted roast mushrooms. The mushrooms were amazing. There was a lot of garlic so neither of our breaths were pleasant the remainder of the night. We also had cold sake, which is always delicious to me. To push our palettes in explore mode, I ordered ankimo (monkfish liver). My friends; It an acquired taste. LOL. I, on the other hand, enjoyed it. The restaurant is tucked one block away from busy U street (on V street). Look for the Japanese Lantern outside of the front door. First glance you would probably think sushi; however, be adventurous and taste the more authentic Japanese dishes on the menu. Whether youl like it or not, it definitely a taste of Japan.Arigato Ne!, This place is hidden behind the ever popular U Street corrider in a tiny little house. Upon arrival you are grilled at the door by the Hostess Nazi. We had a reservation but I was thirty minutes early. So I was going to check out the bar. Not happening! I noticed that nobody was standing at the bar and a couple was standing at the front window. I wanted to see if anyone else was at the bar. Maaaan she locked on to me like a guided missle. I could feel the heat from her stare. After crushing a few Jameson at The Brixton , ( No booze served here just beer and Saki) m.yelp.com/biz/the-brixt206 I returned. We were led upstairs to a small dining area. Approximately 40 seats... All seats were full! I was siked! The menu online looked awsome! The one item I overlooked on the web menu was that, Menu is subject to change Doh! Lets eat! Monkfish Liver w/Yuzu miso vinaigrette . (Yuzu is a sour orangey lemon citrus fruit) The Monkfish liver had the flavor of a foie gras but no way as dense. The combination of miso and yuzu worked well together. Marinated eggplant with dashi was my least favorite item. It had the appearance of those slugs you poked with a stick when you were a kid. Each peice had lots of flavor but I think the whole texture thing (and the thought that I was eating a slug) kinda spoiled it for me. It seems that they had two default garnishes and plate presentations. The majority of the items were either served over shredded Daikon with 6 cucumber moons (stuck together and almost impossible to separate with chopsticks) or topped with Bonito flakes. The place offer protein fill daily rice balls. We chose the salmon. Sushi rice was a bit too salty for me... Dont get me wrong.. I eat that salty Smithfield Virginia Ham! Still tasty! One of my favorites was the smoked slices of Makerel (looks like all raw and smoked items are in six slice portions). Lots of even smokey flavor and a ginger thing going on. AWESOME! Panko and onion crusted fried pork! Just a little over cooked but still juicy and crunchy. Nice and even blend ratio of onion go bread crumbs! Sorry but the random brown sauce kinda got lost on the table! Next fried rock shrimp and vegetable fritter. Way under cooked and that was evident from the globs of under cooked batter. The best of the fried items were the chicken thighs! Hot! Juicy! AWESOME! *Be very careful because these were cooked to order and HOT* The garlic puree was outstanding and pairs well with the pork too! Uni Starter! Sea Urchin... I always think that this should be served to compliment a dish but tonight I was wrong. Lightly tossed in a vinaigrette of random tastiness and served raw. This item jiggles a bit and is another chopstick users nightmare. Last item was a scallop carpaccio topped with shredded myoga and shiso tossed in yuzo. Eh... Definately a must go again kinda place!, I love this place - adorable father daughter owners who make each visit just amazing. Both times that I went for dinner we ordered omakase, meaning the chef just sends out what he prefers on that given evening. From the sashimi, to fried chicken, to an amazing eel and egg dish... it was all unique and delightful. Cant wait to go back tomorrow!, Yeah I really wanted to like this place but I wasnt impressed. I mean, the place is okay but it certainly doesnt live up to the hype. I love the concept of an izakaya and I came for dinner with a friend on the recommendation of Klimans blog. (He lists it as one of the places he goes to, and he is usually on point)That said, I dont know what the hell hes thinking. This place is overpriced (its Kushi prices for Ikea decor and so so food). My friend and I spent over $100 for dinner for two (without drinks), and we left hungry. So anyways - what did we get? Yellowtail jaw, sashimi platter, some sort of seaweed salad, squid salad, eggplant, monkfish liver, and mushroom assortment.The yellowtail jaw was sublime. It was simple and grilled perfectly. We ate it up. The eggplant was tasty enough, but the texture was slightly off for me. The sashimi platter was a total disappointment. The fish did not taste fresh. I didnt like a single thing except for the egg omelet. The monkfish liver was also a big disappointment. I liked that they give you a ton of it, but they served it in a bowl with a gigantic dollop of this really spicy mustard that completely overpowered it. The parts of it I was able to scrape mustard off was tasty though.The mushroom dish was amateur. It had waaaaay too much salt (and I salt the hell out of my food). I had to throw it away.As for the other stuff.. Well they were edible. But I give this place 3 stars for the service and the yellowtail. All in all, it has good potential. They just need to use less seasoning and get fresh fish. Until then, I guess Ill go back to my go to place Kotobuki., First I will say our server and the atmosphere were fantastic. The owner on the other hand a little awkward and not very friendly. There were a few really good food items but nothing to write home about. Im sure I will return because my fianc39 really liked the food. This shows that everyone has a different palate so you should try it for your self, I am updating my review because I really liked what I had tonight, much better than my previous time which was only the second day after the opening.This time it was early enough to secure seats downstairs at the counter right in front of the chef Mr. Seki. We started with the aburi tuna, then special sashimi, monk fish liver with Yuzu miso and Shiso leaf (Excellent and unique combination!!!), obanzai (assorted vegetable appetizer). Then we had grilled salted Sanma, then Yudoufu (tofu cooked in sea kelp broth, and eaten with bonito flakes/scallion/grated ginger/soy sauce mixture). To finish it up, I had Bukkake Inaniwa Udon, which was to me, Tanuki Udon, (because Bukkake typically has more than sea weed, scallion and deep fried Tempura batter) but it was delicious with Kansai (Osaka, Kyoto) style broth. I am a Kanto (Tokyo) person but it had a nice natural and subtle flavor. As for the drinks, I had a Coed Beer, Pinot Noir Chile and another red which I don remember the name... The service was very good with everybody being quite attentive including Chef Seki and his lovely daughter Miss Seki. I really enjoyed the food prepared by and under instruction of Mr. Seki with 39+ years of experience. This is a rare place where you can sit and enjoy good food right in front of the chef and tell him how much you like the food as you enjoy it., After living in Japan and going to izakaya all the time, this place was okay but not really an izakaya. Izakaya are where people in Japan go out for drinks since bars and clubs are really from Western culture influences. Izakaya are the traditional drinking houses where each group of friends gets a small private room for an intimate and festive gathering, often with unlimited food and drinks for a set fee and a time limit.So this place has the little dishes (like tapas) served in izakaya in Japan but no small rooms as it is more Western with a bar and normal tables upstairs. The main chef is Japanese which is a good sign and the food did taste as it should.We tried the karubi beef, karaage chicken, and obanzai salad. The karubi was good and tasted as it should. The karaage was a fancy version and quite delicious and also filling (unlike most items on the menu look to be). The obanzai salad was a trio of salads including shredded daikon, gobo, and some black seaweed.The extensive sake list was impressive and I admit I not a sake expert. The kind waitress explained some information about sake to us and helped us pick one that would go well with the beef and chicken. It was great!So, yes this was a good place if youe never had Japanese izakaya food before as I think it would be quite interesting. If youe been to izakaya in Japan, this wont be so exciting as it pretty expensive and not filling so you shouldn come hungry unless you want to spend hundreds..., My favorite Japanese place in DC. It was like jumping into a cute place you would find in Tokyo. The garlic fried rice was so good because of the garlic chips. The sashimi special was super fresh, cut to perfection and I was totally happy with hokkaido scallops. Tempura was really good too. Everything here is done with precision and well price., This place is very cute and I would definitely go again if I was in neighborhood. It was a pleasant experience. We had the pork belly, which was braised in a light soy sauce and served with a little spicy mustard. Delicious! The grilled beef short ribs had great flavor but the meat was a bit tough. The tempura was very tasty, very light, and it was so great that they didnt just batter a bunch of carrots and broccoli. It was a selection of white sweet potato, pepper, eggplant.Not sure why we didnt have any sushi or fish but it looked good and I might try it next time. However we sat at the bar and it did smell a touch fishy but not bad. Contrary to common belief, fish really smell fishy., Went here with a girlfriend a couple days ago. I heard a lot of great things about this place, but I wasnt blown away. We had a few dishes which were delicious, and then others that were just so-so. I think this place could be great, but you have to know the right dishes to order. The fried rice was a bit boring, and their rice balls were also boring. The sashimi of the day was delicious, as well as the chicken meatballs. Overall it was only a mediocre experience for the price that we spent., Authentic Japanese - in every way!This little spot feels like a bit of Japan (or a small Japanese restaurant in New York City at the very least) for many reasons. It seems to be authentic in every way:Authentically Japanese in a Good Way: Freshly prepared dishes, right into front of you if you are sitting at the bar; definitely tasty Chef is actually Japanese (a rarity in DC) and part of the menu is in Japanese too  Extensive Japanese beer and sake selection - they even have an umeshu chuhai!Authentically Japanese in a BAD way: Japanese food at Japanese prices! This place is wildly overpriced, especially considering the high dollar threshold of dining out in DC.  Japanese portions - Tempura shrimp special = 2, yes 2, medium sized tempura shrimp, tasty but $8 for 2? A tiny saucer of paper-thin kalbi for $11? At $6 the Sapporo draft was the only thing we had that didnt feel outrageous - the mugs are small though.Decor is simple and somewhat stylish but the waitress was quick to hustle the check to us - even after bringing a full beer.Overall, I am very disappointed in Izakaya Seki. Im used to expensive DC dining but this was almost insulting. Even in New York City you can find upscale Japanese food with larger potions! This restaurant has the potential to be much better - all they need to do is tweak the menu with regards to portion vs. price.Sadly, the DC dining scene is so starved for anything different, especially for authentic Japanese, that Isakaya Seki will likely attract many people. Some will happily part with lots of cash for something different. Others, like me, will leave hungry, grumpy, and in search of a slice of pizza.If you are going to spend the big bucks, go all out and go to Sushi Taro!, This place is amazing. I recommend getting anything with pork belly in it. We got their special pork belly dish with marinated tofu which was awesome, and the udon with pork belly which was also incredible.Word to the wise: prepare to wait. This place is packed. I went on Thursday at 9pm and they still had an hour wait. It is very small, which is really nice if youre already seated but stinks if youre waiting for a table.They also have a very extensive sake menu for any sake lovers., 4.5 stars for Izakaya Seki-- 5 stars if not for the admittedly high prices.This charming Japanese Izakaya is everything that Kushi should be, but isnt: simple, well-executed, consistent and homey. The flavors are spot-on, just like moms cooking, and the ingredients are fresh and high-quality. The sake list is incredibly varied and is laid out and explained well for the novice sake-drinker. The menu itself is small, but perfect, with rotating specials that add to the excitement for regulars.Favorites for me included the grilled sardines (all of the grilled whole fish were amazing), the pork belly kakuni with tofu, and all of the sashimi dishes. Everything is cooked to order, and it was such a pleasure to sit at the sushi bar and watch the chef diligently and skilfully execute his craft. Their no-reservation policy can be frustrating, but the seats usually turn over quickly, and its worth the wait for this sweet home away from home.As stated above, my only complaint is the price: however, this, I now know, is an inevitability for quality DC restaurants, and this is one of the best Ive experienced so far., 4.5 StarsWhat Washington has been waiting for: an intimate Japanese izakaya. Kushi may be good, but I found it too big, too loud, and trying to do do too many things. For those unfamiliar with the term, an izakaya is a drinking establishment that serves food to go along with drinks (from sake meaning alcohol, and ya meaning shop) that have a red paper lantern (akachochin) outside when theyre open. Laid out over two stories in a converted townhouse just off of U Street, Izakaya Seki feels off the beaten track. It is a bit pricier than the kind of places you would find in Japan, but the concept is the same.The menu is limited; this is not a sushi place, so dont expect to find that on the menu. To start off, ask for some otsumami (snack to go with your drink). I had raw squid with wasabi. They do have a couple of sashimi options, either the appetizer or the special. I went for the special which included six pieces of the freshest fish you could imagine, including toro and yellowtail. I also had the broiled yellowtail jaw, something of a Japanese comfort food that you dont see to often in these parts.Since an izakaya is ostensibly a drinking establishment that just happens to have food, Seki does not disappoint. Two draft beers (Kirin and Sapporo), and a whole host of Japanese microbrews in the bottle/can. They also have several brands of the izakaya staple shochu (essentially the same thing as soju for those more familiar with the Korean version). More importantly, since Mr. Seki is from Niigata, where Japans best rice (and thus best sake), comes from, there are some 24 varieties of sake by the bottle on offer, although none of these come cheap.Go early and sit at the bar. This is the best way to enjoy the personalized service and intimate setting., The izakaya is the crowning achievement in Japans amazing food and drink-related culture. Its a shame every city in America doesnt have one with flavors as authentic as Izakaya Seki. The cream croquettes were by far the highlight for me. They come with a sauce the waiter called a mole, but it tasted like Japanese curry to us. Whatever its called, it was so delicious we ended up ordering two more shares. Almost everything we ate had a surprisingly authentic flavor, but the place is not perfect. The beef tongue doesnt have the same texture or seasoning as Ive had in Japan and the atmosphere is more like a regular restaurant. But the chance to eat amazing tsukune, rice balls, lotus root salad, karaage and several other dishes in a restaurant thats in walking distance to my place deserves 5 stars. I understand the complaints about the cost, but if youre the only truly authentic izakaya in DC, you can charge what you want and still fill the place.As for drinks, they have a decent selection from several Japanese breweries and distilleries, and the ladies loved the Calpis Sours (called Calpico for some reason). For all their selection of bottled beer, though, the draft selection needs improvement.One last tip--get the black sesame dessert if its available!, Nice place. I ate there just after it opened. ITS NOT SUSHI! I highly suggest the Rocketfish Jaw. I don care for expensive small plates I feel like I am being taken advantage of which is why I give it a 3 star rating. I had to stop by the Mexican place next door because I was still hungry after spending over $100.However, customers who were in the restaurant and like asian dishes and know their sake raved about this place. Just not for me., Great food and experience overall, as I expected based on previous visits! But last night the woman that seated my group wanted to put us as a tiny table even though there was a larger one open. She said she was saving that one, but I pointed out they dont take reservations, and I would have made one if they did. She finally seated all of us there, slammed down the menus, and didnt say a word to us again that night. Irritating experience to start with., Best non-sushi Japanese restaurant in Washington, D.C. Service is warm and impeccable. The saki list is all encompassing and the decor is comforting. A must experience izakaya!, Nice restaurant, small portions, a bit overpriced for what you get. Nice addition to the neighborhood though., Outstanding! My fiance and I went last Friday night and had a wonderful meal. We sat in the last two seats in the downstairs bar - probably the best seats in the house. We sat directly in front of the grill and saw every single mouth-watering dish that went out. The sake selection is huge for DC - its not cheap, but the one we picked out was really tasty. The sashimi is very fresh, but the highlights were the various grilled and fried items we ordered. The tempura was light, crispy, and included some items you dont usually see in tempura dishes in DC (including lotus root, mushrooms, and a wonderfully crispy shiso leaf). The fried oysters were juicy and flavorful and came with a tasty garnish of parsley tempura. I loved the eel with cucumber salad - it had none of the cloying sweetness you usually find in barbecued eel, and the texture of the eel was yummy. My favorite savory dish was the fried tofu in dashi - great custardlike texture in this fabulous broth, topped with bonito flakes and green onion. Yum. The highlight of the meal, though, was the black sesame flan. This is as unexpected and delicious a dessert as anything Ive had in DC in the last 6 years - it was just SO flavorful. I absolutely loved this place. Yes, its expensive, but that doesnt mean it isnt a good value. The experience and quality of food are so unlike anything else Ive had here. I cant wait to go back and try some of the other dishes we watched go out (especially the fried rice, udon, and various grilled and fried fish)., Very authentic Japanese food and drinks. Excellent quality. The only downside is that it is rather pricey, so I cant come here very often., Solid 4 stars. Everything is awesome, and Ive had some 10 items from the menu, except udon. Avoid soups in this place, they are small in size, and lack 50% of ingredients you get in real udon., My friend and I caught a glimpse of the red lantern outside, and decided to head inside to an inviting warm entry on a cold Friday night. Once inside, we found a bustling well-lit industrIKEA (industrial + IKEA) setting. Theres a no reservations-policy, so we had to wait nearly 30 minutes for a seat, but the bar was lively without being crowded. We found the drink menu filled with a great balance of solid choices and some surprises, without feeling overwhelmed.The wait went by quickly and in good company downstairs, with very solid servers. Once a table opened up, we headed to the packed-but-not-crowded upstairs seating area. From there, it wasnt a long wait for efficient but friendly service, filled with helpful advice on the menu.Among all items shared from my side, there was the tako wasabi, tsukune, kushikatsu, tempura special, and a really nice special for the day with squid.As others have rightly pointed out, expect very ornate dishes on very small plates which can run towards a very steep bill very quickly. We enjoyed a good time, despite feeling empty and overcharged. The raw dishes are seasoned great, but are not the highest quality. The fried dishes tend to come out overly battered and soggy. The real winners are the grilled, steamed, and noodle/rice selections.However, the evening ended on a truly bad note. We had already paid, and were still in the process of finishing our drinks, when our server made a point of coming to our table specifically, asking us to leave so that others could be seated. It is important to point out here that no one else, during the course of our time there, had been asked to leave early so that others could be seated. We should know, given our own wait time.Of all the tables upstairs, we had not been there the longest, there was actually a spare table open, and were in the process of finishing our drinks (not to mention also about to leave a generous tip). Adding inept to insult, when we went downstairs to leave, we saw absolutely no one waiting for a table in the bar area or entryway. It was such a unexpected, rude, and uncalled for gesture.I really wanted to like this place, as an added shot of diversity to an already great area in DC. But the food needs to tone down the pretentiousness, and the service needs a serious quality check. Skip and head over to Kotobuki, Umi, Kushi, or Makoto instead., Authentic food, yes, but its average. Izakaya Seki tastes better if youe never had authentic Japanese. Visit if you want to try it out for that simple fact. Ask the waitress about items that aren on the menu. There are a couple.They also don take reservations. Their sake selection is extensive (for DC), but the menu itself appeared more knowledgeable than the staff. Ie had better sake. The head chef clearly didn like Americans. He would sarcastically respond to any attendant who sat at the bar, and when asked by another group where was from in Japan, he responded with a mispronounced McDonalds. He did this while giving free food to the Japanese attendants. Since Japanese dining history dictates a chef relationship with you is as important as the food, this place loses authentic points. The hostess (who was also serving that night) clearly couldn keep track of complaining guests. The servers flat out told us they would not serve us upon request....something was just off about that restaurant that was clearly affecting its staff..Deserts were mediocre, food was OK. Service was terrible., We stumbled upon Izakaya Seki on the way to 9:30 Club. I exclaimed, So its here! having heard from many fellow Yelpers about Izakaya Seki, it was located in a quiet, up and coming neighborhood. We were starving after an event looking for a place to have dinner. The restaurant was closing at midnight we had only about 15 minutes. We walked into the ground floor which housed the kitchen and a simple plain bar. Instead of sitting in the dining room upstairs we stayed downstairs. At the bar we had the view of the kitchen with many hands hard at work. I started with a Kirin and bf had sake in bambi cup. The menu was interesting with mostly bar food, Japanese style. For a start, we had two types of rice balls nicely toasted seaweed sheets wrapped around rice balls, one with salted cod roe and with the larger salmon, we saw the chef mixing the roes into the rice before shaping. They were tasty with bits of saltiness from the roes. The fried oysters were coated in crunchy panko crust they were light and tasty. The special of the night were these fresh sardines they were really fresh served with yuzu dressing giving it a refreshing taste. Lastly, the eel was very tasty with slices of pickled cucumbers. The dishes were just perfect as snacks since it was too late for dinner at that time but we had enough food to fill us up. I would love to go back since the menu has interesting specials and exciting dishes., This is one of those hot new restaurants in DC, it seems anything Izakaya gets rave reviews in DC, it one of the hot new cuisine types. Izakaya is basically a Japanese Tapas type restaurant, and Izakayas are basically small plates but try to add twists to the dishes. Unfortunately, I didn think Izakaya Seki was all that great. The tapas were just ok, it wasn too flavorful or experimental like other Izakayas I have went to and I think it overrated. I actually ate here on the same night that Neil Patrick Harris visited this spot, but I just missed him, too bad! He seemed to have liked this place, but unfortunately for me, not even a celebrity endorsement from Neil Patrick Harris is going to make me give this place a higher rating than 3 stars., My BF and I ate here last month on a whim after drinks at Nellies. I like the fact that its off U Street by a block, but was surprised at how anonymously it sat on the block in the little townhouse.While my terrible memory and the time between dining and writing this is preventing me from detailing our entire meal, I do remember four things we enjoyed: * Sashimi appetizer--an assortment of fish, fresh, nicely cut. Not much else to say here. * Hokkaido scallop carpaccio--very fresh and sweet. I love scallops, whether raw or simply cooked and this was lovely. * Mero grilled with miso--I had to do a quick search to find out that mero is Patagonian toothfish, often sold as Chilean sea bass here. It was delicious and perfectly cooked. * Ankimoono (steamed monkfish liver)--Even my BF, who says he doesnt like any offal, although he loves pat39s and sausages, enjoyed this. Monkfish liver is very mild and, in my opinion, doesnt really have any flavor of liver. The texture is silky and overall went well with the yuzu sauce.Service was attentive and we sat upstairs. The interior is sparse, and isnt a place that Id likely choose to go for happy hour with a bunch of friends, which is typical of izakayas, but well definitely be back as a couple or a small group for dinner or snacks., My friend and I went on a Monday night right after work (around 6:30), so there was literally no wait. We were one of only two tables seated. We were seated right at the end by the window, which was ideal. The server, who I believe was Ms. Seki herself, took a lot of time explaining the specials to us. We reminisced about Japan and my time in Kyoto. She was very gracious and had a delightful countenance.The decor was nice - pretty spartan, clean, and cozy. The service was great - wait staff repeatedly came back to inquire on us, replaced our plates in a timely fashion (thats a big pet peeve of mine... when they dont replace dirty plates), and constantly refilled our water and my beer. The place really started filling up at 8 pm and getting very lively. The food is expensive for izakaya fare, but Seki had the feel of a real izakaya and the dishes tasted like izakaya fare should, even if the prices are not comparable to whatd you would normally pay in Japan.As for the food...The pork belly (buta bara) was executed perfectly (tender with lots of fat and quality soy sauce). Also, I really enjoyed the squid salad - crunchy with a tart green vinaigrette. My table also shared the vegetable tempura (which didnt leave an impression) and a saba mackerel. We also had croquettes, which were really big but tasty. I ordered 2 Echigo Red Ales. They have a huge sake and beer selection, if you like Japanese beer. We ended the evening with a plate of ice cream and akuzi (red bean)-filled profiteroles. It was a pleasure to savor tastes that made me nostalgic for izakaya food that I had in Japan, and there seemed to be a lot of care taken in making the food taste as true to its origins as possible., WOW! That was my word. had Uni, fried blowfish, Pork belly and Fish stew. Everything was so fresh. I feel like I was eating a restaurant in Japanese fisherman town. I LOVE this place. Unfortunately they do not have a high chair for my 1 year old daughter. But they were super nice to us., This review is for those who have lived in Japan/ eaten at real izakayas. Seki is the best yet in the series of Izakaya-style places to open in DC, and a real step up over Kushi, but we still have some distance to go.Sake menu is good... Strange that they had one-cup sakes available too. only draft beer choice was Sapporo, disappointing. Sashimi- obviously varies but last night Tako(octopus) was a standout but hamachi was a bit stringy. Maguro was supermarket-grade. A bit pricy for what you get. Uzaku (eel and cucumber) special was best thing of the night. Eel was super light and tender.Meats - we tried the kalbi and also the karaage. kalbi was a bit oversalty but fine. karaage chicken was oddly stringy in texture (freezerburn?) and not as juicy as karaage should be, but was tasty. The couple next to us loved it but honestly the karaage i make at home is better.Yakimono menu is seriously lacking. No yakitori, no negima, no shishitou ... just not much to choose from. The grill space in the kitchen is super limited. Loved that they offer onigiri for $3.50 - simple way to end the meal.All in all - its nice to have an offering in DC that is more authentic than kushi. But Im still waiting for DC to get a place as good as some you can find in New York., We walked into Izakaya Seki at 7:15pm last night and asked for a table for four. We were given an estimate of 20-25 minutes for our table. We gave them our number and left. Forty-five minutes later we hadn heard from them so we called and were told that they were very busy and that it would still be a few more minutes. Twenty minutes later I returned and was told that we were the next table so I went and got the rest of my party. At this point it was 8:45. We were then told to go get a drink somewhere and that they would call us when our table was ready. I asked for an estimate and the woman said that she couldn tell us, only that it would still be a while, possibly thirty minutes.I have no problem waiting for a table at a restaurant as long as they are upfront about the wait. What I find inexcusable is being told it a 20-25 minute wait, and then made to wait 90 minutes only to be told that our table isn ready and they can give us an estimate as to when it going to be ready.We ended up going somewhere else to eat., When I read about this place opening on Prince of Petworth, I was super excited. Id been longing for some traditional Japanese. This place does not disappoint! The food and drink was reminiscent of my time spent abroad in Japan. Pros- Good Food- Cool Venue, very low key- AWESOME drink menu, they have shochu AND chuhaiCons- A little cramped- If you arent familiar with Japanese cuisine, youll certainly be lost, Have visited several times.And, I have to say, I was honestly blown away by every single dish. Service and ambiance are great. Yes, you may have to wait on the weekends, but its well worth it.The plates are small, with unique, but well-thought out combos. I can NOT wait to go back for more. This is definitely my new favorite spot., Go here! I was visiting DC and a friend suggested that a group go here for dinner. It was amazing. The decor is somewhat industrial and minimal, but extremely relaxing and comfortable-a great balance. The waitstaff was really helpful and guided us through the menu making suggestions and also made sure that we ordered the right amount of food. All of this was great, but the best part was the food! Insane how good it was. We had the following (there were five of us):the house cured mackereloystersscallop carpaccioan eel special (my personal favorite)a tofu specialvegetable tempuraassorted roast mushroomschicken meatballskalabiWe also tried a warmed bottle of saki, which was delicious.I read some of the other yelp reviews say that people will only like this place if they have not been to izakayas in Japan, but I have been to Japan, and I completely disagree.This was one of the best meals I have had in as long as I can remember., I am so thrilled to live a block away from this place. Ive been several times since they opened, and am consistently pleased with the quality of the food and the overall dining experience. The service can be spotty, but Im flexible and hey, I only live a block away, lets not be an a**hole. It gets crowded, especially on the weekend, but during the week Ive always been able to sit down easily. The quality of the seafood, especially the sashimi = melt in your mouth. Im also a huge fan of their fried rice. I always split it with my dining partner, but secretly want it all to myself. Great beer + saki selection. Minimalist decor, no BS. Yes, I am a fan., Went here and yes, even on a week night there can be a wait - but its so worth it. The food is fresh, delicious and so delicately done. The place gets crowded, but after eating here once, you wont mind the wait. I recommend the watercress salad with sesame, the beef tongue in miso and sake(duh!) to wash it all down. The tempura is ok, but i would come here for the grilled stuff and sashimi.Sit at the bar for a full on show: the lead chef slices and mentors the other chefs while you enjoy beautifully garnished, simple but tasty Japanese cuisine., The place is great. Very, very authentic Japanese style servings coupled with a vast selection of Japanese styles beers and alcohol. Id say the only drawback is it is very, very expensive. Shouldnt be a deterrent, just a caution., ALL of the food here is amazing and the sushi is the best Ive ever had before!! The menu is pretty expensive, but definitely worth it. The place fills up really fast and so you definitely need to have reservations beforehand. Although its busy, I still received excellent, fast and attentive, service which I appreciate. I liked the cozy environment and had a nice time out to dinner with my friends. The location is somewhat hidden away between U Street and Columbia Heights since its in a neighborhood so if you find it, appreciate the DC specialty....its pretty awesome. :), maybe we just ordered the right things, but i thought everything was great. granted, it isnt inexpensive by any means, but the food + atmosphere makes it worthy of five stars, i think. we got there pretty damn early, around 5:30, and we were the first people at the counter. got to use my rusty-ass japanese with seki-san. ordered the spanish mackerel special, obanzai (lotus root, seaweed salad, spinach), ankimo, and fried baby octopus to start. and then we got the fried oysters on seki-sans recommendation (which were HELLA GOOD), along with the sashimi special and the uni starter. yeah... it was a lot of food. but we did good and finished. oh right, we also got the black sesame flan for dessert. drinks were the hitachino ginger brew and dassai nigorizake. anyway, not much more to say, other than nomnomnom., Id been wanting to try this place since I read The Washingtonians guide to best Japanese restaurants (Nov. 2012). Plus, since moving to the U.S. from Japan Id been missing a good izakaya so I was really excited about this place! I ordered the tuna sashimi, shime-saba, kalbi, and kushikatsu. Everything was great! It was not the best tuna sashimi, shime-saba, kalbi, or kushikatsu I have ever had, but everything tasted really good! Now, why did I only give this place 3 stars? While I understand that the place is small and they have limited space, I dont like to be rushed out of my table so the next customers can sit. Also, while I enjoy good service and the removal of empty dishes from my table, I would prefer that they wait until Id finished eating. I had to grab my dish back from the staffs hand!!! The portions are small and dinning can be pricey, so at least let me finish eating before you take the dish from my table!If you have never been to an izakaya in Japan, you will probably love this place. Now, if you used to live in Japan and enjoyed going to real izakayas... you will really miss Japan!, Go Here. Just do yourself a favor and just go. Izakaya Seki is one of those places that is tough to capture in words, as most of what makes it great is the actual experience of going. But, Ill try to sum it all up. When you walk in, there is seating AT the bar with stools and you can look over and literally watch the cooks make your dishes and others. Sit here- however if you have a larger party, there is an upstairs with formal seating. Try the specials.Get the Sapporro- ON DRAFT. Dont over think it; just eat and enjoy! :), Great beer selection. Sashimi was excellent. Get the assorted mushrooms and sausage with grainy mustard. I had better yellowtail jaw so I would skip it., A fantastic find, if you are a relatively adventurous eater and/or like sashimi. I wouldnt go expecting to be super full after, but do expect fresh fish, authentic Japanese cuisine, and lots of dishes to choose from. We ordered about 10 dishes. The yellowtail sashimi was my favorite, but it seemed like everyone in our group liked something a little different. The rice balls, the mushroom salad, the octopus... there wasnt a dish that we didnt like. A no frills atmosphere and great food., What I found most appealing about Seki was that it wasn Japanese food but limited to sushi/sashimi, but it was the most authentic izakaya/pub food in Ie had outside of Japan. I loved the robin eggs, karage (japanese fried chicken, and soba (buckwheat noodles). Even the beer was served izakaya-style....a large bottle of Kirin and four small glasses for your neighbors? Yes please!DC has been a bit lacking for Japanese food that both authentic and affordable!.This place covers it! Now if they had the tatami seating and place to store your shoes....Just look for the red lantern with the symbol that looks like a bottle.....and you are there!
29|jardenea-washington|Brand spanking new farm to table concept restaurant in the Foggy Bottom area located in the renovated Melrose Hotel. We had the honor of being among the first crowd for the grand opening (not sure how we got on the list but glad we did). We got to try a bit of everthing that night and there were some notable standouts. There were some lamb shanks being served as apps that were delish (I think my mouth salivated thinking about them just now), the seasonal salad and both of the main courses were top notch. Of course, the interesting thing about a place like this is that their menu is fairly fluid, given the seasonal availability of different foods, but the chef did such a good job with the other items that I dont think you will be disappointed., The Melrose Hotel has done a beautiful job of renovating and creating a delicious farm-to-table restaurant. My review is of the preview dinner, so some items may vary from the current menu. Starters:- Fruit and nut salad with pomegranate dressing was a really good mixture of textures and favors. I really like the pepitas, cranberries, cherries, sultanas and spiced walnuts. Every mouthful was chock full of nuts (and fruit!). (Note to self: if making this at home add some goat or blue cheese, just my opinion)- Blue Crab Bisque was good and had a nice kick to it. I generally wouldnt order soup but this had nice flavor and warms the heart on a cold night.Mains:- Most DC restaurants have rockfish on the menu. What I liked about this dish were the blue corn grits.- Cast Iron Seared 1855 Filet of Beef with white truffle pommes dauphine. I havent taken French since high school but whats not to love about fried mashed potatoes, and mixing it with choux makes it awesome. Dessert:Pumpkin Creme Brule - As a creme brule it was perfect but as a pumpkin creme brule it was a little disappointing because the pumpkin was at the bottom and not mixed. It was a good finish to the menu though., Friends and I had a wonderful Christmas dinner at Jardenea.The atmosphere is modern. The menu offers very interesting fare from well-known purveyors.The Meyers Ranch fillet of beef was brilliant, prepared and presented perfectly. The Hawaiian Mero got a rave review as did the Karabuta Pork Tenderloin. My vegetables were delicious and were appropriately chosen for the the beef.The wine is priced for value which is so rare in DC restaurants these days. A small but trustworthy selection.The service was seem less throughout the entire meal. Obviously well trained.I look forward to coming back with business colleagues and friends & loved ones.Jardenea is a smart choice., My wife and I had dinner there the other day. We definitely recommend it. Its in the lobby of the Melrose Hotel. I understand that the lobby and restaurant have been completely renovated and the restaurant just reopened a couple of months ago. The decor was very modern and the service was excellent. There were very few people there on a Wednesday night, but that may have been due to the fact that it recently reopened. The food was also excellent. For starters, my wife and I shared the crab cake and the beet/goat cheese salad. And for mains, I had the lamb and my wife had the sea bass and blue corn grits. We didnt stay for desert, but we did order mixed drinks. I had a cucumber/ginger/gin drink which was very tasty and not sweet. (I ended up ordering a second one at that bar). My wife had a raspberry drink, which was also very good, but maybe a bit sweet for my taste. All in all, a great choice., Jardenea, tucked away inside the Melrose Hotel, is a restaurant serving New American cuisine. This is a great place if youre looking to impress for a great date. The restaurant is modern, upscale and quite trendy. However, when we came on New Years Eve, I thought the food was okay, nothing spectacular. Maybe the fact that it was a 6 course $90 price fixe menu had something to do with it. Generally, for a restaurant that doesnt normally offer a price fixe menu, this could be the issue. I thought that the food, although well presented, was not very well seasoned. I thought the duck was quite bland and other courses. Also, the steak received varied among each one of us (I went with 5 others). Everyone asked for Med-Rare and people received steaks Rare to Well Done. This is what I thought was a serious flaw for a restaurant with so much potential. I thought the experience was great and I would definitely come back. Well just try on a normal night and see if the food is more up to par., After having eaten my way through DC the past five years, I was surprised to find myself surprised at the quality of Jardenea. Promoted as a farm-to-fork restaurant serving American cuisine that also located inside a hotel, I definitely has some doubts at first. But the few reviews convinced me to give it a try and the food/service convinced me to come back.My girlfriend and I came by on Valentine Day, where they served up a succulent five-course pre-fixe meal. And by no means were they small courses either. The first course offered up three perfectly fried oysters over polenta that provided a perfect opener. That was followed by an extremely generous and buttery slice of foie gras over a piece of french toast, using the sweetness to cut through the richness of fancy duck livers. After throwing in a very simple palate cleanser, the main course was a surf and turf combination of butter poached lobster and filet medallion that still has me drooling over my keyboard. Dessert may have been the only dish where I didn lick my plate clean before reluctantly handing it off to the server, but it was a very Valentine Day appropriate plate of strawberries and chocolate mousse. Granted our experience was on the most Hallmark of holidays, but I imagine that the quality of the food and the attentiveness of the service (when our server realized that they skipped our third-course palate cleanser, he immediately offered up a complimentary glass of wine to make up for the oversight) holds up on an everyday occasion. If there was one complaint, it would be that the restaurant is located right in the lobby of the Melrose Hotel, which means that depending on where you sit, you can definitely hear the foot traffic and the conversations of those enjoying the hallway lounge/couches. But overall, a very small price to pay., Came here on February 15 for an observed Valentines Day dinner. We walked up to the restaurant entrance inside the hotel, which isnt clearly marked except for some stacked menus. There was no one there to greet us, but it was 5:30 and I acknowledge that on a Friday, thats the beginning of the dinner hour. Someone was quick to appear and seat us at our table. The Restaurant Manager came up to greet us shortly after we sat down and offered me a rose, which was a nice touch. He also explained the concept of Farm to Fork since we hadnt dined at the restaurant before. We started with the Prince Edward Island Mussels, which were by far my favorite thing that was served. They were so delicious I could have licked the bowl clean. The boyfriend then ordered Crab Bisque and I got the Caesar salad. He was mixed on the bisque, as it wasnt typical New England style, and he said it tasted fishy. I liked my salad, but while the presentation was wonderful, the taste was nothing special. We got the Duck and Filet for our main courses. Both were good, tasty, and cooked to order. Now for the 4 star rating. -.5 stars for the Restaurant Manager. He was VERY attentive. I appreciate a check in every now and then, but he came up for 5 minute conversations at least once a course. It could be such a nice touch, but for me it was overdone and had me avoiding eye contact with him in hopes he wouldnt come over. Another -.5 stars for the flow of the dinner. We ordered 4 courses (Starter, Salad, Main, and Dessert) and were in and out in an hour exactly. This was in part due to the fact that there were two other couples dining at the same time, but it was a special occasion and I wish I could have spent some more time talking instead of eating my food before it got cold., This is my first yelp review and Jardenea inspired me to write it. We had such a lovely time there last night that I could not resist. I was so impressed by the restaurants ambiance, the staffs hospitality and the quality of the food. The food on the menu is locally grown and so fresh that you immediately taste the difference. We were treated wonderfully as soon as we walked through the door of this beautifully designed restaurant. This place really is one of Washingtons best kept secrets!, Are they kidding with this place//!! ,We booked in the hotel for the weekend and that started the catastrophe, the room was a dump ,my breakfast was half an hour late and the order was wrong and the food was cold anyway ,when we called again we were told they were very busy and we would have to wait.The next night against our better judgement my friends met us at the hotel and suggested we try the restaurant ,,it is located in the lobby of the hotel but we could not find it until one of my friends happened upon this cavelike entrance ,with no hostess no waiters and no customers ,I implored them to leave but they held there ground ,like it was a challenge .we sat ourselves,finally were spotted by someone and had possibly the worst meal of my life ,the concept is farm to fork ,What? you are not clever with this ,my fish was frozen in the middle my friends steak was charred beyond recognition and the service was rude ,obnoxious and confrontational ,dont bother, Amazing food, its weird that you have to either wonder around or ask someone where the restaurant is located inside the hotel. Dont let that stop you, the food is worth the inconvenience., Yesssss. The Jumbo Lump Avocado Tian tasted like freshness, delicious jumbo lump crab and avocado freshness. My entree was a tender veal dish - I forgot the exact name - which equally blew my mind. The best part was the mushroom bread pudding that came with it and tasted a lot like Semmelknodel (Google it) which triggers happy memories for me since my German mother has made it every Christmas and Thanksgiving since childhood. I dont like the texture of mushrooms but I stuffed my face with whole mushrooms because it was so good! I tried a bite of the chicken roulade which was tender and tasty. Its also nice to look around at the newly renovated boutique hotel, which was beautifully designed. Yes to everything., Strange that the place did not appear to have a host stand and it was confusing where the restaurant started in the hotel lobby, but the food was wonderful and the decor refined., We came here after a long an busy day sightseeing in DC. We read the reviews and sort of knew what to expect in finding seating. The service was excellent and the food was very good. The restaurant manager was friendly and came by to talk to us for a bit. I LOVED the music and the decor. Overall, a great experience., We were meeting family from Winchester, coming in on I-66, so Jardenea seemed like an easy location and was able to handle a fairly large group. We definitely picked right. The place is very quiet, so conversation was easy. The service was outstanding--we felt completely taken care of and pampered. Water glasses were filled regularly, wine was poured, and while waiters were amazingly on top of every single need, they were never intrusive. The food was also excellent, though some of the dishes could have used a little bit more of a kick (the veggie orzo dish, for example, was slightly bland but a nice vegetarian option nonetheless). One of our partys salmon arrived overdone, and as soon as she commented, a waiter whisked her plate away and 5 minutes later she was presented with a new plate, done perfectly. My only complaints are that the wine list is pretty pricey (though we were able to find a moderately priced cab which was very good), and the ambiance is nice but still has a bit of a hotel feel. Overall, a great meal., Its a little hard to find as others have noted, inside the Melrose Hotel off of the lobby. The menu had some nice items but was a bit limited. One fish dish and one chicken dish were fine but nothing spectacular. The service was indifferent - no issues, just people who seemed to be going through the motions. The place was not crowded when we went, so maybe they had an off night. There are a lot of good restaurants in the area, and this one did not stand out for me., Nice restaurant. Kinda pricy but good food, Let me say this before starting the main portion of this review: the food was exquisite overall and presented beautifully at every turn. The flatware sparkled and the napkins were elegantly folded - although strangely enough there were two of them for each person present at the table. All of the food on the menu is locally sourced, coming from nearby Virginia and Maryland for the most part. Some notable exceptions to this rule (on my visit) were the Hawaiian Sea Bass and Alaskan Salmon. This is fantastic, although they will serve you $7 per bottle Norwegian bottled water if you ask for water. For an American restaurant this is immensely strange. Try asking for tap water if you dont want to pay for it. Also of note: the restaurant itself is difficult to find as it is located in the lobby of the Melrose Hotel and is completely unmarked from the outside. The hostess standing at a blank glass table outside is the only clue that a restaurant can be found somewhere within. Jardenea gets four stars because the entire restaurant must have been powered by awkwardness. The light fixtures and I am sure every appliance in the kitchen run on the tangible uneasiness felt by diners here. Within 10 minutes of sitting down, the waitstaff had come to our table perhaps half a dozen times to accomplish such difficult feats as helping us get our napkins in our laps and pouring the absurdly expensive water. Dessert took quite an effort to order as there are no menus for it and the hostess had to serve as emissary between us and our waitress (who by this point was AWOL). We ordered a chocolate souffle which was also delicious, but took 25+ minutes to emerge from the ghostly depths of the kitchen. During this time, the manager apologized twice (without need) and offered us free champagne - which we declined the first time... and which then arrived without our asking. He said it made him feel better. This effort would have ended the night at 5 stars on flavor alone had our check come within thirty minutes of our finishing the meal. Throughout the evening, our waitress, another waiter, the hostess, and the manager approached us multiple times - and while eating our entrees (a delicious duck duo with Asian pears) the manager and our waitress watched us eat from the corner of the front dining area. As disconcerting as this was, there was no weirder point in the evening than when the ultra-ultra-attentive waitstaff completely abandoned us after we had finished eating. The food is probably worth the trip - but do bring your patience and dine a little later in the evening if you dont want to be alone with the watchful waitstaff while you eat., Loved grass fed beef with potatoe cake and chocolate cake. Mussels just ok but folks around the table loved crab bisque., Very kind restaurant manager and staff. I celebrated my birthday here and was absolutely delighted by the quality of the food, the happy wine selection, and the sweet, genuine service. This restaurant is in Georgetown but so close to the foggy bottom metro, in the elegant Melrose hotel., Food was great and so was the wine. I especially enjoyed the Cherry Glen Farms Goat Cheese Salad and Hand Rolled Pappardelle. My wife enjoyed the Grilled Salmon Mignon. Perfect balance of flavors. You must check out Jardenea if youre looking for nice evening out. Its a great place for a date and the ambiance and service is wonderful., Valet when you dine here. Lovely little place great for a date, Had dinner with my kids. They dont have kids menu or simple food like pasta but they offered margarita flat bread and burger. We ordered a few small plates. In the order of the best to the least, we enjoyed mussels (amazingly good....highly recommend), crab bisque, crab cake and margarita flat bread. Highly recommend this place. Price very reasonable for the service and quality of food, A hidden gem. An outstanding gluten free, farm to table meal. Delightful sangria. I can say the bread looked and smelled wonderful, but I really can say more about that. I enjoyed the Spring Asparagus Salad to start the meal. It was large enough to share. My main course was the Grass Fed Fillet of Beef. The beef was like butter (best said with a NY accent) and cooked to perfection and the potatoes were the best darn potatoes I have ever had. Dessert. I do love dessert. Often times being gluten free means being stuck eating food that is good by gluten free standards. I do not buy into that flawed theory. Excellent food, especially desserts, are either delicious or they are not. The Caramel Cr38me Br3bl39e was a top notch home run!! Another gluten free option was a chocolate souffle; next time. All of my expectations were exceeded., Outstanding food! Had the lunch menu for Restaurant Week and it was delicious. The salad with spinach, strawberries and oranges was one of the best salads Ive ever had. Also the burger and chicken ciabatta tasted good, nothing special but still tasty. The dessert - a chocolat mousse based cake - was the cherry on top of a great lunch menu. Wonderful that you get a refill when you order fresh orange juice. Great Restaurant Week experience, highly recommend., Amazing food experience! Its located inside the Melrose Hotel which is a gorgeous boutique hotel in Gtown. When you walk in, the decor makes you feel like you just entered the lobby of a hotel in Paris. Service was first class. Our server Ishmail was very knowledgable of the menu item and every recommendation was a hit for us. Sea Bass is one of the best I have ever had! The Creme Br3bl39e is a must to end the dining experience., The food is AMAZING. Seriously, some of the best food in DC. The atmosphere is nice as well. Its a hotel, so its quiet and intimate. I took my parents and friends here as a thank you for visiting. Theyre older - around 70, and they absolutely LOVED it (which is the first time thats ever happened). They are pretty pickey. I will definitely be back. Worth every penny. Also, easy to get reservations on open table. Jardenea feels like a hidden treasure., Went in on a Friday night for date night. The restaurant is kind of hard to find; there is no host or real entrance. The doorman leads you to the bar where you just wander through until you attract the attention of a waiter who seats you. Awkward, but a nice little hidden gem.The restaurant was dead, which I didnt expect for a highly rated restaurant in DC. I appreciated how quiet and private it was though, and the service was top-notch.Great wine list if you love wine, however the selections by the glass were limited. So that means go with your fellow winos and buy a bottle (or two.)For appetizers, we ordered the crab bisque which had great flavor and complemented the bread. However, there were maybe three very tiny pieces of crab in the soup, and although I love mushrooms, they greatly outnumbered the crab.The goat cheese salad was delicious. The vinaigrette was amazing. A+.I ordered the diver scallops wrapped in bacon. Although the menu says bacon, they are actually wrapped in a thin prosciutto (the waiter explained that because the prosciutto cooks more quickly than bacon, the scallops are never overcooked.) The dish was so good I was sad I couldnt finish it. The scallops were perfectly cooked, and although the waiter said the plate only came with four, I somehow got six. It was so good my boyfriend agreed my dish was better than the duck confit he ordered. I only wish they had added a little more red curry around the plate. We ordered creme brulee for dessert which was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Not enough caramelized sugar on the top for my taste. I will get the smores next time!, This was easily the best restaurant experience I have had in DC yet. Everything about it was perfect... the food, the ambiance, and especially the service. Moreover, the portions are huge and the prices reasonable.They start off your meal with two complimentary breads, a standard white one and a unique and lovely raisin one. Definitely have some of the raisin bread but make sure to save room for dessert because the chocolate lava cake is fantastically delightful.I ordered the Bell and Evans BBQ Chicken Roulade and everything about it was awesome. The presentation was beautiful, the chicken couldnt have been softer, and the stuffing, combined with a piece of chicken, mac & cheese and bbq sauce couldnt have made for a better bite. The service though is what really put the place over the top. We had the nicest and most passionate waiter. You truly felt like he cared wholeheartedly about your experience. And the way in which he described each entree was so in-depth and appetizing that it was hard too resist ordering everything he recommended. I cant imagine someone not enjoying dinner at Jardenea..., This place did not disappoint at all, and living in LA I know what good food is all about. Jardenea is located inside the Melrose Georgetown Hotel and, as another reviewer mentioned, has a bit of an awkward entrance. Upon entering the hotel you turn right to enter the restaurant area, but there isnt a host stand and we walked around looking for one until I noticed a tablet with the floor plan placed on a dining table right by the entrance and figured thats where we should wait. We were greeted promptly and escorted to our table.I had the mussels to start, which were cooked in a tomato broth that was flavorful but didnt overpower the mussels. Next came the lamb entree - it was cooked bone in and very very tender and juicy. The carrots were cooked to perfection and I suspect they may have been sous-vide. My evening was capped off perfectly by the rich, buttery creme brulee; Ive had my fair share of creme brulee and this one is near the top of the list. Its also worth mentioning that I had a bite of my brothers Hawaiian sea bass and it melted in my mouth. The blue corn grits were a nice compliment to the dish as well.The service was prompt and friendly, and our server even took the time to come by and explain the special garnish on my brothers sea bass plate. He also answered my questions in depth and had good knowledge of cooking methods and wine tasting notes.The atmosphere is upscale-casual and definitely a great place to bring a date or simply dine out with friends and family.I will definitely be returning the next time Im in town!, Ugh, here I go again with a less than positive review. I hate doing this! This was supposed to be a super-cool evening. If you want to go to the Kennedy Ctr by shuttle from the F/Bottom Metro, this place is super-convenient. You can get off the metro, walk here, get on the shuttle! EZ Piecy, nice and easy! I hope this will work out for you. I was there for the price fixe menu which was not cheap, especially if you tack on the wine pairing. Let me just say there was very few things that caused this demotion of stars, but let me focus on the good. I loved the first courses more than the fish. I loved the appetizer--type first courses more than the fish for sure, but the rack of lamb was way way way overkill for calories and just stomach space. We couldnt finish it. (A few days later I saw a menu for another restaurant that does the same thing, two types of meat (fish is a meat!) along with the other courses. The desserts were good, except for this spongey flan thing that was like eating a shoe. The service here was worth the 35% tip I put down, and the wine selections were on 3/5 times. Its not really worth it if you know wines. So....awesome service, good to very good food (not great, as in destination-great), and convenient. Thats 3 to maybe 4 stars. But, I believe this place was set up as an after-thought within the hotel it resides. I believe this was either, or designed to be a bar or little cafe for the residents. This supposed to be a white linen-tablecloth, swanky fru-fru place. Its practically in the lobby of the place, so, people went in/out all the time, with rushes of frigid wind freezing people in the restaurant terrifically. It was super uncomfortable, so much so, I moved to the back of the restaurant, and it was still super-cold. Also, since this arctic air was blowing in like crazy, it dragged in the cigarette smoke from in front. Nothing ruins your taste buds faster (esp a $400 meal) than smoke. But, wait theres more. The music in the lobby of the restaurant was some tinny teeny-bopper music that was really really lo-Fi was the same music playing (almost blasting) in our ears in our swanky little over-priced restaurant. Uh, shouldnt it be like Spanish guitar or classical or jazz, or something??? It was incredibly inappropriate for this place. It was the same stupid music all night long. I couldnt wait to get out despite the wonderful service from the wait-staff. Ill never ever ever go again and never recommend this place., 3.5 stars (4 stars if only rating the food)ServiceThe service was pretty good, but I felt like our server kept trying to push us to order more... Maybe it was his tone? Maybe it just seemed like he was being really persistent? I dont know. Location/AtmosphereAnd the location was not great--literally the lobby of the Melrose. We felt the cold draft from the lobby door all night. And for some reason, even though it was almost empty (there probably was no need for us to make a reservation), it was super loud. Either a) all the people that ate there are obnoxious or b) the acoustics were just really bad. I mean, in the middle of our meal there was a huge group of men in business suits chattering loudly as they passed us... And finally the bathroom was all the way outside into the hotel lobby and downstairs. Kinda awkward.The FoodTheir raisin bread came warm and delicious. Mmm was hard not to eat the basket of themCherry Glen Farms Goat Cheese Salad with Shaved Beets and Baby Arugula, Marcona Almonds (I declined the Orange Blossom Honey Vinaigrette) - pretty good. The arugula wasnt bitter at all, the beets were cooked just right, and I loved the refreshing presentation (I feel like its almost always cubed). In this dish they were sliced with the creamy (not too strong) goat cheese smashed between slices. And I love Marcona almonds, which was a great addition to the dish.Pistachio crusted Atlantic Salmon with Braised endive and roasted brussel sprouts - pistachio crusted anything. Gimme gimme gimme!! So... I actually am allergic to orange so I asked for a swap out of the sauce, and I wasnt a huge fan of the onion base that it came on. The salmon was really good though, as were the brussel sprouts and tomatoes.Chefs choice: Chocolate torte-very rich, but pretty delicious. Loved loved loved the hazelnuts. And the creme and chocolate wafer (it was all chocolate) set it all off.I might come back for the food--one of the few restaurant week places where I actually had trouble deciding what I wanted! But honestly, the location isnt great, and the environment itself isnt conducive to a classy sit-down meal at this price... Definitely tell me when the chef goes somewhere else!!, Came here for restaurant week, had a great dinner. I had the crab bisque as an appetizer, it had huge chunks of crab in it, was delicious. Then I had the pistachio crusted salmon for dinner. Cooked perfectly, and the brussel sprouts were great roasted. The chef chose the dessert, which that night was a hazelnut chocolate cake. It was good, maybe a bit heavy, but I still ate it all. My only complaint was that it was kind of hard to find. It was inside a hotel and tucked away without any signs so you really have to know where youre going. But for restaurant week it was great, they definitely didnt skimp at all in terms of amount of food, we all really liked it., Excellent dinner at Jardenea. Our waiter was fantastic- I wish I remembered his name but he was working Friday evening and immediately put us at ease. Beautiful interiors, and the food was presented and plated beautifully. We stayed for quite a long time, ordered two bottles of wine for the three of us and were never rushed., One of the best dining experiences in DC. Five of us dined at this restaurant on Saturday night. The decor is elegant and comfortable. The food is wonderfully prepared and presented, the menu is extensive, the wine list is perfect. The waitstaff is attentive, knowledgeable, friendly, and unobtrusive. The ma3etre d took great pleasure in discussing the wines we had ordered. Our party included diners who have eaten in some of the finest restaurants around the world, and they were delighted with this memorable meal. Cant recommend more highly., Three friends and I made our way to Jardenea for Restaurant Week, for which Jardenea offered an unusually diverse menu (unlike some places that only offer their lowest-cost items or provide a mere 2-3 options per course). On a Saturday at lunch time, only two other tables were occupied--the place was nearly empty. Its strange that the restaurant has no clear front entrance; when you walk into the Melrose Hotel, you are greeted by a small lounge area that leads back to the front desk. To your right, through a lounge area, is an open...breezeway...with no sign or marking that Jardenea is there. After a bit of shuffling, we located the awkwardly invisible entrance and were seated. As an appetizer, I ordered the Autumn Artisan Mixed Greens Salad, which was nicely done and presented. The toasted black walnuts added just the right amount of crunch, and the milled apple cider vinaigrette was a refreshing spin on a typical dressing. My companions ordered the Jumbo Blue Crab Cake, which they all raved about. Entree time! I followed my salad up with the beef sliders, which both my friend (who also ordered them) and I found far too dry. The beef had been overcooked, but it was not tough. I do have to give kudos to the fries, which were just excellent. Another friend ordered the Grilled Chicken Range Chicken Club (odd dish name), which benefited from a good dose of avocado and not the measly drop of avocado that many restaurants offer. When dessert time had arrived, the waitress brought over three dark chocolate cake slices--although none of us had ordered them. Being an unusual mix of non-chocolate lovers, and being under the impression that there were at least two options, we inquired whether another option was available. The waitress returned shortly and offered a hazelnut cake as an alternative, to which everyone readily agreed. This was my first encounter with a hazelnut cake, and I was definitely pleased. Notwithstanding the thin layers of chocolate (purely personal preference), it was a decadent-but-not-too-rich dessert that was a fine finish to the meal. On the service front, the waiter and waitress, who came in sort of a tag team, were responsive when they could be found. Altogether, we had a very pleasant experience at Jardenea. The place would do well to somehow mark its entrance so as not to send patrons calling on the front desk, but does a solid job of bringing nice spins on everyday dishes., This is a true diamond in the rough! The food, service, and atmosphere are all excellent! The restaurant is situated in the Melrose Hotel and there are no signs visible from the street, so those who dont know, will probably never know that there is a superb restaurant at this location. The seabass is to die for, the duck is also wonderful, lobster bisque is mouth watering. Service from Joe is outstanding. Wine is reasonably priced. Cant say enough good things about this place. This place is not cheap, but a very good value for what you get. Try and see for yourself., Pretty decent restaurant for lunch, but by no means a brunch place. A fellow Yelpie friend and I visited for Sunday lunch and were hoping to have brunch / breakfast options as well, but were only given the lunch menu, which had disappointingly fewer options than most other restaurants.The restaurant is a bit hard to find at first. Its located in the Melrose Hotel in Foggy Bottom and there arent many signs pointing to the restaurant, but if you walk past the tables on the right side when you first walk in, youll find this hidden restaurant. The vibe was somewhat classy and was spacious. But it was confusing because there were no signs or a hostess stand or anything. We walked in and a waitress seated us.Service was decent and they filled our waters a lot, but they didnt really indicate whether the sandwiches we ordered would come with fries (and the menu didnt indicate that either). It would have been nice to be able to ask to substitute for a side salad instead of fries. Also, our food took quite a while to be ready. 25 minutes for two sandwiches when they didnt have many other customers. They didnt even bring out complimentary bread or anything else.I ordered the Grilled Free Range Chicken Club sandwich (toasted ciabatta, ripe avocado, Applewood bacon, and chipotle mayonnaise). My sandwich automatically came with fries, which were actually quite delicious. The sandwich was filling and tasty, but not extraordinary. My friend ordered the Roasted Turkey Breast Panini (rosemary focaccia, cranberry aioli, baby brie cheese, and hydro bibb lettuce). She said it was filling but she couldnt find where the cranberry aioli was in her sandwich.Overall, decent place, but not a restaurant Id be wanting to visit too often. Service was slightly off and the food wasnt extremely impressive., Meh... not impressed is my takeaway from Jardenea. I was excited to try Jardenea and had picked it off a long list of other restaurants that a fellow Yelper and I were deciding between to go to on a Sunday morning. This restaurant is located within the Melrose Hotel when you walk in and it is to the right. There is no signage and we actually had to wait in line at the check-in desk to ask where the restaurant was. Part of the restaurant looks like it is just couches in the lobby, but then as you walk in a little further, there is another section that is slightly partitioned off.Note they do not have brunch! When we arrived the server asked us whether we wanted the breakfast or lunch menu. We said both, however when we sat down and started looking over the menu, we were only given the lunch menu. When I asked for the breakfast menu, she came back a few minutes later and told me that there would only be one thing I could order off the breakfast menu. I wasnt interested in that particular dish, so I ended up ordering off the lunch menu. We had already placed our orders when the woman who first showed us to our table came over to take our order. That pretty much sums up the service we experienced at this restaurant, which was not accommodating and very disjointed and the restaurant was practically empty.There werent a lot of options on the menu, so I settled on the Roasted Turkey Breast Pannini. Its sad when the fries are the best part of the meal! The fries were very tasty and the sandwich was all right, but it mainly just tasted like turkey with brie. I was unsure whether they had even put the cranberry aioli on my sandwich. In the end, the disjointed service and just ok food made me wish we had picked somewhere else off our list!, I did not try the food. Good service. Good happy hour specials., The food was excellent -- if not a bit pricey. I had the Caesar salad (very creative presentation) and the pappardelle (very rich flavors). My wife and in-laws also enjoyed their food very much. We were well taken care of, with multiple servers (and, perhaps, managers) pitching in.One word of caution: If youre expecting to use valet parking, its not always available. I ended up parking several blocks away on a less-than-warm evening., Nothing tastes as good as welcome feels. Dont get me wrong, the food here is outstanding. Fresh and well prepared. But its the staff that really puts it over the top. Very friendly, attentive, and above all, welcoming., The food was delicious and the price was right but the atmosphere felt very hotely and I wasnt hoping it wouldnt (it is located in a hotel). The bread basket is full of delicious bread and the lobster ravioli comes with a whole claw on top (its been shelled). The crab bisque was good but tasted very crabby (which I liked but its intense). It was my moms birthday and they brought her a chocolate larval cake with a littleBirthday sign on it which she really appreciated., Completely overrated based on my experience. Went in for dinner at 8 and there were only two other tables seated. This immediately made us weary since Blue Duck was overflowing with patrons. Our server gave us water and disappeared. We flagged another server down to put in our orders. 10 minutes later, no food so we asked for some bread since we never got any. The server gave us a sassy he already getting you some. Who is this phantom he? We have no idea. Apparently neither did the server, he came back a few minutes later with bread and rudely said, here your bread. The entrees we ordered, the duck two ways and risotto were fine but nothing special. Each were $2x which is pretty standard but the portions were tiny. The risotto was served in a sharing plate, I know this because the table across from us had the same size plates to split a salad. We were starving afterwards and ended up hitting up wholefoods for food. Very sad..., Fabulous service, great ambiance. Food was perfection - the crab/avocado salad was so fresh and tasty, my husband had the lamb which was also divine., I was only here for happy hour but if the appetizers and drinks are any indication of the quality of the food, call me impressed. I came here on a Friday during cherry blossoms so it was more crowded than usual with tourists/stuffy older types and the bartender got a little flustered but it still was a nice experience. The happy hour is served at the bar on the left of the hotel entrance- unmarked. The happy hour is mon-fri, 5-7pm with $5 drinks, $5 soups and appetizers, and $5 off entrees. This is definitely one of the nicer happy hour deals Ive seen from a fancier restaurant. I ordered the tamarind margarita, asparagus bisque, and potato wedges with bacon and blue cheese. My friend ordered the pomegranate martini and Maryland-style chicken wings that came with ranch. Everything we ordered I would get again. The portions werent large but they werent small either, just right. The potato wedges were perfectly crispy and the toppings were delicious. The chicken wings were probably the best wings Ive had in the DC area thus far, perfectly moist and tender, with a homemade-tasting ranch. The soup was creamy but light and refreshing. And the drinks were handcrafted- normally the types that would cost $15 at a nice bar. I will definitely be back!!, great food, creative presentation and friendly staff!, This is a lively restaurant. The food is excellent and interesting. Appetizers were amazing - pork BLT sounds odd but it was the best, ever, and filling for an appetizer. Try it! Beet and goat cheese salad was good though the goat cheese tasted more like ricotta. Delicious dressings. Crab cake appetizer is very good. All crab though no lumps. Fresh and yummy. Crab bisque had a nice bite. The cocktail list was quite good. Entrees were also good. Bathe waiter was s bit odd. Over talkative though good service. It is quiet and trendy. Try it out., The ambiance and service here were lovely. My dining companions had wonderful sea bass but I have to say my stuffed chicken breast was as dry as sawdust. The polenta accompanying it was quite tasty though. All in all, fine but a little disappointing., The waiter/staff were so hospitable!! if youre not sure about something on the menu dont be afraid to ask! Our waiter Jose gave some great suggestions!! The bar had a stellar happy hour; cant beat 5 dollar drinks & appetizers IN GTOWN I came for a Business meeting.. We held our meeting in the lobby/bar area and the staff did a wonderful job bringing out ALL OUR drinks and orders in a timely manner! I will be back here for happy hour, Had a lovely ladies dinner here one Tuesday evening. We basically had the place to ourselves, except the bustling patio. Our server was a little over attentive, but then my dining companions are pretty attractive, so I guess it can be understood. We had the cheese plate to start and the avocado and both were great. Of our entrees, two were delish, and the fish was extremely fishy and not a favorite. Overall, nice spot for a farm to table meal., Its a very nice dining room and the food is excellent and very fresh. The oysters were delicious. The Kale Salad is exceptional and the seafood cob salad very good. Not too pricey either and a very nice team. Lunch service was a bit slow but overall a good meal. Valet parking is only $5. Another plus., Excellent menu selection , brunch well thought of combination of ingredients. Had the organic chicken club sandwich with avocado , large portion and the French fries were perfectly crispy and not a drop of grease! Kids shared a chocolate pancakes and Benny done just right, they loved it! Hubby devoured the kale salad and the steel cut oats with banana br3bl39e ! Will be back for dinner, What a fantastic and comfortable dining experience! We were staying in the hotel and has heard good things about the restaurant but had not tried it! One evening, we had retired to our room early for a nap and woke for a late dinner. We went downstairs and found the staff to be delightfully friendly and accommodating! We were seated immediately and offered an array of appetizers from which we selected the Chilled Peach Soup! What a deliciously refreshing soup for such a hot day. For our entr39e, we both selected the Hawaiian Sea Bass. It was light with just the right amount of sweet flavor for a hot summers evening. Enjoy!, I was skeptical that a restaurant in a hotel could deserve so many great reviews, but Jardenea does. The food was really outstanding. We had oysters, salmon, Caesar salad served in a pyramid shape, and veal scallopini with some delicious parmesan orzo. All were excellent and the service was great too., Lapin and I came here to have breakfast for his birthday. We were seated rather quickly and was in the prime seating area in front of the windows for people watching. The area was nicely decorated, the Frette napkins and small jars of preserves/jams made the place feel fancy. We both ordered the Altantic as we were starving and Lapin got coffee. The coffee was the same coffee they have for free (for guests staying in the hotel) in the lobby before 10am. The food came out fast and was hot. Although, we were told by the server that everything is prepared ahead and it is just served upon ordering. This was incredibly off-putting given the price. How can it say two farm fresh eggs any style but I could only get scrambled and not eggs benedict like I wanted...? The service was meh at most. After bringing us our food and coffee no one came to check in and the plates were left there when we got the bill. We paid the bill and left and the plates were still on the table., Excellent service; very knowledge and attentive wait staff. Experienced their new fall season menu. We were a party of eight with variable tastes and each chosen dish was spot on. Nice wine list. Lots of sampling of each individually dish and overall agreement that dishes represented the fall season. Lovely, quiet dining dining room that was conducive to conversation., I went here for dinner during DC Restaurant Week in August, and it was simply fantastic, one of the best meals Ive had in ages. It is located in the Melrose Georgetown Hotel, a short walk away from Foggy Bottom Metro. The hotel lobby is gorgeous very modern, but not cold. They have excellent happy hour deals, and their signature cocktails are definitely worth stopping in for (and for $5, they are one of the best kept secrets around).Most places during RW offer new dishes not normally on their menu to offset the cost, but Jardenea offered the same dishes as what was on their normal menu, which I appreciate because I get to sample what their normal fare is, not what they created specifically for RW. I ordered an amazing appetizer of chilled peach soup that had a cinnamon cream with a slice of peach that had been bruleed. It was a bit sweet for a starter, but really good, and creative, I dont think youd find this dish anywhere else in DC. For my main course, I had a seared duck breast with a savory fig & rosemary bread pudding, which, if I am honest I ordered for the bread pudding and it did not disappoint. The duck was so tender, and perfectly cooked, its probably some of the best duck Ive ever had. I highly suggest this restaurant and I will definitely be returning for their full price menu., A hotel feels it has to have a restaurant: it made this restaurant. Goal achieved.Theres not really a reason to eat here. The food is bland but well-presented. The ambience is lacking due to its location essentially in a lobby, and lackluster decoration. (The presentation is good, but doesnt make up the decoration.) I cant think of a reason to eat here versus the many similarly generic business dinner places in town.One point I want to emphasize to management: advertising the name brand linens you use with logos on the napkins... ugh., Went for breakfast and was actually surprised how good it was considering the place was empty. The pancakes were definitely among the better ones Ive had. Service was a little strange but good experience., I subtracted one star due to ambiance. While the restaurant decor looked great, I could barely hear my bf speaking from across the table because they were having this huge company happy hour in the bar area. After an hour, most of the people had left and then we could finally hear that there was music playing in the restaurant! The food was impressive. I had the pappardelle carbonara (not exactly the name but basically) which was phenomenal. Probably the creamiest (and most caloric...) pasta dish Ive ever had. But so good! My boyfriend had the cider marinated pork, which was also delicious but not quite as delicious as mine. We shared the ice cream trio, which was great. Cocktails were very alcoholic. Too strong for me. And I chose the one that sounded the sweetest and least alcoholic...Pretty expensive but worth it. I would consider it again for a celebratory dinner of some kind.
30|joes-seafood-prime-steak-and-stone-crab-washington|Have you ever considered sending a restaurant flowers after a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience? Bag lunch it for a bit and save up - you will not be disappointed. Start with the location - prime - and the building - historic - and the atmosphere - upscale as the White House and as comfortable as your favorite pair of jeans. Romantic lighting but never dim, music and service that sets the tone but is never intrusive, open areas or luxury private rooms - what kind of experience are you looking for? Build in time to admire the details - architectural and otherwise. Why are you really there, though? The food and beverages - fantastic! My friendly wine-snob tells me the wine list is surprisingly broad and versatile. My gluten-free friend was accommodated with grace and ease, and the vegan was grudgingly impressed - no easy feat. Just say lamb chop and my wine-snob, who is also a meat snob, will actually gush - and he has high standards on wine and lamb. I have been dining out with these people for years and we have never had as perfect an evening as we had at Joe., Our first experience at a Joe was at the Miami location. We were so excited to find out that they were opening a DC location that we went on opening day. For the first night, I was really impressed at how well put together the staff was. It seemed as though they had been open for years! Our waiter checked on us multiple times, gave us great recommendations and always had a smile on his face. For those who have been to the one in Miami...the DC location is a bit more stuffy. Definitely a lot more people in suits and ties but please note that that is not the required dress code. Also, I noticed they didn even give us bibs for our claws! Not that I whining about it but I thought it was a fun/cute touch when I was in Miami. It kind of lightens the mood a bit.We love the stone crabs so much that we had the claws as our entree. They come in three sizes, medium (7), select (6) and large (5). All sizes are equivalent to a pound, the difference is that the large sizes are easier to get to the meat. Anyways, we ordered two larges which were 59.95/each. Yes, it a bit pricey but they are high quality....so unbelievably sweet and sturdy. You won be disappointed. If stone crabs aren your thing, the menu offers all kinds of steaks, fish, bar food and apps. We also had the following:Madagascar shrimp - one ginormous shrimp, which they behead/peel for you at the table, with key lime aioli. very good.BLT Bib Wedge Salad - this was a great started. excellent for bacon lovers!Mushroom Mac and Cheese (side) - I would probably not get this again. If you don eat it right away, it gets dried out.Key Lime Pie - THE BEST KEY LIME PIE IE EVER HAD. They are famous for this so make sure you save room for dessert.TIP: I don think they advertise this on the menu but you can order half-sized portion of side orders. This gives you more flexibility to try more dishes. They also make one hell of a mojito!!!! I had three. Enjoy!, Fresh, like a new car and one of those fancy ones where everything is well-thought out and planned - but not going to make you want to take it up to 120 on a rural highway....Day two of opening and the place is firing on all cylinders like the Lexus it is - how does that happen? It happens when you combine a landmark restaurant, Joes Stone Crab in Miami, with a restaurant group, Lettuce Entertain You out of Chicago, who know what they are doing. This is definitely not the Joes in Miami, but more of a steak sports place with awesome food (including crab), service and a grand space.First, the space. Who knew that DC needed another upscale casual place but its gorgeous. The soaring bar area is actually bigger than the restaurant. With big TVs, great tables and booths - the place understands that DC is about people watching, mingling and finding a spot to hang at the circus.Second, the food. Of course you have to get the stone crabs, especially during the season (now). They are great and exactly what you get in Miami. However, the steaks is where it gets fun - especially since they ask if you want it dry or wet aged. No other place in DC currently asks that and about as good a big steak as you can get - with some great sides. The menu pricing runs the gamut from reasonable to very expensive - basically something for everyone.Finally, the service - awesome - answered a flurry of questions from us without missing a beat and everything was served perfectly.Overall, a great bet when your looking for something upscale and fun and without any surprises., Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Hell yes! The space is striking and dramatic. Youre welcomed warmly and ushered to the gorgeous bar area for a cocktail prior to being seated for dinner. Waiting 30 minutes for our (reserved) table went quickly, aided by well crafted cocktails and friendly bartenders. Ushered through curtains into the dining room into another beautiful space, we were seated and cared for by a wonderful server. Of course, you must start with the stone crab, as good as I remember from the Miami original. In addition to the signature crab, there is an extensive menu. Our party had a wonderful tuna tartare, bone in filet mignon, sea bass, spinach and fries. All were superb. The wine list was well chosen and reasonably marked up. We brought our own wine (some very special bottles for a special occasion) and the wine service was gracious. Corkage fees are fair. All in all, Joes partnership with Chicagos Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises is a huge hit and welcome addition to the D.C. Restaurant scene. Is it ground breaking, adventurous cuisine? Hardly. Is it impeccably prepared food in a gorgeous setting, with superb service? You bet!, went to happy hour on friday and place was crowded; jumbo shrimp was fantastic., Steps from the White House, you step into a restaurant that is fitting of it proximity. I have to empathize with Sandy A review,  Have you ever considered sending a restaurant flowers after a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience? Cause that how I felt. The service at this restaurant is impeccable. A well orchestrated symphony of waiters are at your every beck and call. But, you don even need to beck or call them because they are so on point. Order a diet coke, youl get a mini diet coke poured at the table, and as you drink the glass, the waiter will come by and keep on topping you off. I swear they must have went through an entire china cabinets contents. I know that this happens in nicer restaurant. I mean... how dare I use the same fork for my shrimp appetizer as my seared ahi tuna. I not an animal. So with every dish and every step of this 500 mile meal, a new fork, spoon etc was placed next to me. Waiters stand on the flanks of the main dining room watching over like sentinels/hawks/NSA #ButInAGoodWay. Our main server deserves an oscar for his performance. Recommending dishes, guiding us through the meal, and being omnipresent. A waiting level of professionalism that I have not seen but at the Kennedy Center. The simple niceties too. Never dropping off a check until we ask. Sweeping the crumbs off our table. Making sure we were VERY well taken care of. Yes, the service was that good. It deserves it own paragraph. Imagine Beauty and the Beast #BeMyGuest. And yes, our waiter was french like Lumier. Started off with the Whale Appetizer which included stone crab, jumbo shrimp, ceviche, and snow crab claws. All pre broken with the meat just ripe for scooping. The ceviche was DELISH! Everything is done a la carte. The menu is filled with Tales of a great steak house. Find all great things about seafood, meats, and other classic American cuisine. We ordered the mac and cheese with wild mushrooms, fried asparagus, hashed browns, and broccolini as sides. The mac and cheese was SOLID. So solid that we ordered another helping cause everyone wanted more. The fried asparagus with a special lemon sauce they poured table side was crucially delicious. The hashed browns needed a little more seasoning/and or butter. I wish they were the shredded kind, but they were the home fry southern style. Yes, I hear you This isn waffle house. But hey, if youe gonna offer hash browns.. do the better ones! Also needed a bit of seasoning. I didn try the broccolini, I not a huge fan of it. My ahi tuna (asked for rare) and it was definitely rare. This could have used a little more seasoning. Also the shape was funny. If I had to be picky (which I am and I don like to admit)- they should have cut it into a different shape. A seared rare piece of tuna; you should be able to get a little cooked piece with a rare center in every bite. Hence the usual inch cut steak style or thinner tuna-log cut. This was like a hunk- like almost the size of a baseball. So some pieces were just whole chunks of raw tuna. The light mirin sake sauce the was poured table side was a nice subtle flavor addition. I liked how there was wasabi and ginger on the plate as well. OH! I almost forgot the bread basket! DELISH! A basket full of unique and delicious breads to start the meal should be highlighted up in this B. Back to the meal. Ended off with key lime pie and apple pie. The key lime pie was PERFECT. Not too tart or acidic (the fault of many a key lime pie). Just the right amount of condensed milk. Just wonderful. They could do really good to advertise this. I can remember the last time I had a piece of key lime that good. The apple pie was a hearty mound of perfectly browned apples with a crumble on top and a scoop of vanilla. Can get much better than that. Incomparable service 10 out of 10 Appetizer & Main 8 out of 10 Desert- 9 out of 10 Is that how you spell desert? I always get the sand desert and the ice cream desert mixed up... ? Are they spelled the same way?!I would be glad to go back to Joe anytime., Whenever I travel to Miami, everybody and their mother mentions that I have to make a stop at Joes Stone Crab. This has always confused me, since I remembered a brightly colored blinking billboard in Fairfax with the very same name. A place that I would never, ever set fut into. I even pondered getting new friends, because obviously we do not share the same tastes at all.Well, Im about to put my foot in my mouth now, Joes Crab Shack is A WORLD DIFFERENT from Joes Stone Crab. Set inside an old bank space, Joes has high ceilings and a classic wood and leather interior which screams Washington business power hour.I was the first person to arrive so naturally I headed to the bathroom (which is located alllll the way up the stairs, so inconvenient in heels!) to do a quick looksie. Never in my life have I been in a more sweet smelling bathroom. Notice how I am talking about this before I event get into the incredible food or service. Thats how great this bathroom was. Mike B noticed too and we both considered sneaking some of their scented soap into our purses so we could recreate the experience at home. Literally, THAT GOOD.Back to our regularly scheduled program.Service was impeccable. I felt like a Sultan (or more like an uncomfortable Julia Roberts dining out with Richard Gere for the first time in Pretty Woman) with the amount of attention, time and effort that was put into our table. We pretty much had our own harem of servers at our beck and call to answer any question, sweep away any crumb, or to refill our drinks. Even the (super hot) master cocktail maker personally stopped by our table to make sure that my Gin Rickey was perfection (it was).For an appetizer, our table split the Whale which was an Instagram worthy bowl of stone crab legs, jumbo shrimp, ceviche and snow crab claws. Im a girl all about presentation and was super impressed by the seaweed (and not your regular ole ugly seaweed strips..beautiful seaweed) strands poking out of the bowl and the horizontal Ariel bra shell decor. My stone crab leg was super meaty like a thick baby legs thigh.For our main course, half of our table had our hearts broken when we found out they were out of the lobster stuffed sole. I opted for the potato crusted grouper which was light and flaky with a decadent herb butter compote on top. The portion was humongous, I could not even get through half of it with all of the other side items we ordered. While it was not mind blowing, it is definitely a safe menu bet.Did someone say sides? Our table split the brocccolini, wild mushroom mac and cheese (so good, we had to order two), hash browns (I agree with Mike B, shredded hash browns would have been way better), fried asparagus with lemon butter (seriously, just get this..this was the highlight of my night), and broccolini (skipped in favor of the fried asparagus).By the feast was over, I barely had room for dessert. Barely, is the key word. I was able to get a bite of their key lime pie and apple pie in me and was super impressed. I normally hate key lime pie but this was the BEST key lime pie Ive ever had. The apple pie was layered with tons and tons of warm cinnamony-apple layers and the crust was a kin to an apple crumble. With a little bit of ice cream on top....ooh child!While I dont see myself being a regular here, Id definitely keep this spot in my sleeve for a night out with rents, stockbroker power lunch, or sugar daddy date night., This is an absolutely GEORGEOUS space that would be great for a private dinner or event. The food is excellent, and it is in a great location near the white house.While there we tried the oysters (A+), stone crab (A+), shrimp cocktail (A+), Alaskan King Crab (A), Beef Tenderloin (A), ceviche (B+), and cole slaw (C+)The sauces that accompany the seafood are excellent, and the service is impeccable. Definitely give it a try!, OMG! Where do I begin?!!!This outlet of Joes is absolutely fabulous. The staff is extremely attentive and the food, especially the seafood, is to die for. My meal started with Madagascar shrimp, which is a prawn skewered on a piece of sugar cane. Then it is brought to your table and plated and served with a garlic aioli. I ordered the medium stone crabs which were cracked cold, sweet and firm just the way stone crab claws are supposed to be. The crab claws are accompanied by Joes house mustard sauce.My entree consisted of a petite filet, grilled asparagus and a baked sweet potato that is served with a brown sugar pecan butter, with large pecan chunks throughout, yum! The asparagus was tender, crisp and sweet. The steak was not the best I have ever had but it was good.Desserts, Desserts, Desserts!Joes serves at least classic American pies, from Key Lime to Apple. You can even get half pieces so that you can try more than one pie:-)The specialty cocktails could be stronger, but were tasty!Now on to the ladies room. Chip a nail? there are emery boards and polish remover, got a loose hem in your dress?there is double stick tape. cant make a decision about what to do? there is a magic 8 ball. Want to strike up a conversation when you return to the table, there are trivia cards. Then to top it off there is Philosophy lotion to keep your hands moisturizedIf Joes maintains the standard of service and quality of food that they are showing now, they will be very successful in DC!, Where do I begin? I would give this place 20 stars if I could. From the moment you walk in you feel like royalty dining in someones home. Servers and support staff gliding through the restaurant in tuxedos. Making sure there isnt a fork out of place or a crumb left behind. Yet not one person was pretentious. They make you feel welcome. In fact Nina our waitress said we dress up so you dont have too. Really??? Like a line out of a movie. Her service was amazing. My wife thought she was one of the best servers shes ever had. Funny and attentive. We felt like she really wanted us to be there. In fact we are going to celebrate my mother in laws birthday next month and will request her. Now on to the food. Neither me nor my wife had tried stone crabs before. I was a little put off by the fact they were served chilled but Nina explained why and I thought Id give it a try. Wow!!! We got the large order which makes it much easier to eat. The famous mustard sauce mixed with the sweetness of the crab go perfect together. In fact we had another order mid course. My wife had the sea bass which Nina said was her favorite dish on the menu. I opted for the bone in filet. It practically melts in your mouth. We wanted just about every side on the menu but was told that would be a lot of food so she could order them in half portions for us. (Not stated on menu) we had mashed potatoes, fried asparagus, spinach and yes I say and, the Mushroom Mac n cheese. By dessert we were pretty filled but wanted to try the the famous key lime pie. We ordered a half portion and admittedly did not leave a bite. The overall experience at Joes was amazing. All of the staff was gracious and smiling. Someone walked me to the bathroom. Nice touch I wish I could remember his name. Maybe a manager as he was wearing a different tux then the rest. On the way out we wanted to experience the bar and luckily got a seat. My wife had the mojito and I the gin Rickey. Both fantastic but we both agree the Rickey was the winner. Thank you Nina, Joes, and the entire staff for giving us such a memorable experience. We left feeling like royalty. We will see you next month!!!!!!!, I grew up in South FL, and Ie been to the original multiple times as a kid and an adult (so I may be biased).Service: Waiter was great. Attentive and extremely friendly. Was greeted by 4 staff members on the walk back to our table.Atmosphere: Great steak restaurant feel. Great location for a nicer date night out. Make reservations ahead of time.Food: Great food - Took a little longer than usual to be served. Comped dessert for the trouble.Apps- This location doesn have the conch fritters (which is understandable given location). Instead, we ordered the fried oysters but never received them because the fryer broke a few minutes before ordering. Went for a shared caesar salad and tuna tartar. Both were fresh. Main - Originally ordered the fried chicken (why? The Miami location has a $6 1/2 fried chicken that I wanted to try. The owner has this available because she wants customer who can afford the expensive menu items to still have the chance to enjoy the Joe Stone Crab experience) DC price was $18, and never got to try it as the fryer broke. Ordered the panko crusted mahi mahi. Tasted great.My brother, who was craving the stone crabs, got his fix. Tastes as good as the FL location.Dessert- Key Lime Pie: As good as the Florida location. Not extremely tart, good crust, just right. Banana Creme Pie?: Fluffy banana pie w/ caramel sauce and house-made whipped creme was great too.Highlights: Great service, great food, great atmosphere. Priced at a premium (above Miami prices) for location and availability. Good for a steak/seafood date night. Still working out some of the kinks because theye new. John Wall, the coach of U of Kentucky and another Denver Nuggets player (also former U of Kentucky player) were eating a few tables away., Joes was packed the first Thursday it was open and impossible to get a drink at the bar. It was a very nice looking restaurant though. We were able to be seated. Our server was great very kind and knowledgable. Food really was average. $65 steak was good but not great and stone crabs were very good but for five people we had $240 worth and still werent full. I feel like we had an average meal but somehow spent over $1000. Everything besides the food is great. Will check it out maybe at the bar cause I would feel uncomfortable ordering anything but there high end in the dining room., If youre looking for a value proposition then this is definitely not the place. If you are looking for white tablecloth, tuxedos, and phenomenal service then this is your joint. Salad to share is the way to go, the romaine is crisp and refreshing. Great Rockefeller oysters, plump juicy oysters with rich and creamy spinach and bacon. Yellowtail crudo is great five pieces and just as fresh as can be. We ordered the selects which imo were a little on the small side but again this is not for the value. A stellar entr39e and I suggest you order this is the fried chicken. MY GOODNESS has to be top 5 fried chicken dishes Ive had in the past 4 years. Another thing that is decadent and just damn delish. FRIED ASPARAGUS. Best side ever. The pies are just are ridiculous. Had banana cream, key lime, and peanut butter. Just delicious, simply delicious. Ordered half slices of the pies wish I ordered full slices, if I wasnt so full I wouldve without a doubt indulged. Martinis are legit. All in all great place and love the fine dining aesthetic, but with a casual attitude. Pricey, makes me feel like I need a hefty expense account to order more martinis and fried chicken. Crab is not cheap and this is a weighty reminder of that. Cheers and happy eats!, Being from South Florida, I had high expectations .... and all I have to say is that the new DC location is totally living up to their name! Service, food, ambiance all superb!, Ive been a fan of Joes in Miami for quite some time. I had the pleasure of dining at the new spot in DC and thoroughly enjoyed the food and the service!, Service was great. Wine list amazing. Food not worth the price. Desserts horrible. Great ambiance, would go back for a burger and a drink at the bar., Great place for happy hour. Tried a lot of the menu and everything was very good, and the oysters Rockefeller were exceptional. Extremely elegant interior for a DC restaurant with beautiful private rooms for events. Fairly good (but not excellent yet!) service., Since 1981, when I was first introduced to Joes in Miami, I was hooked.Stone crabs, hash browns, key lime pie.Done. Every time. Eventually, I may look at a menu and order something else.Vegas, Chicago and now in my backyard.Lettuce Entertain You is a great company and the partnership with Joes is amazing.The dramatic space is breathtaking.Great service, perfectly cracked claws.Worth reading the history of the stone crab and how Joe Weiss and a Harvard ichthyologist came to serve stone crabs.... 75 cents for four or five stone crabs....of course that was 1921. Joes is a wonderful addition to Washington DC.Remember, it is expensive and if youre looking for inexpensive, go to Long John Silvers. Quality always wins., More like 2.5I really wanted to love this place since I had heard so much about it from my Florida friends, but the experience we had last night was less than stellar. Unfortunately, this place has a couple of strikes against it in my first experience dining there,; however, I am still willing to give this place another chance, perhaps in the bar area or a year from now when things are more settled. One of the first strikes was that at 9:30 PM, our reservation wasn ready and we had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. This was a little annoying because we had checked in half the party when we arrived 20 minutes before out given reservation time. You would think that the host would have been put on notice that we would need to be sat shortly thereafter. It was unclear whether Joe only seat complete parties, but that policy wasn communicated to me when I checked our party in upon my initial arrival.On a positive note, we were seated at a lovely corner booth with a great view of the rest of the dining area. My husband and I started with an order of select stone crabs as an appetizers. For entrees, I ordered the 12 oz filet, and my husband had ordered the 20 oz bone in ribeye. For sides, we split the mushroom mac and cheese. Our server, while knowledgeable about the menu items, must have been in the weeds because we barely saw him after he served us our appetizers. About 20-30 minutes later, someone that appeared to be one of the managers approached our table, asking if we had already ordered. We explained to him that we did order, and finished our appetizers about 20-30 minutes ago. He went back to the kitchen to check on our order, which didn result in our food coming out any faster. About 15 minutes later, the food finally arrived. When my husband steak arrived, there was no bone-in ribeye. My husband asked the server if the steak was the 20 oz bone-in ribeye. The serve offered a short explanation that the bone-in ribeye only came in 26 oz, and that my husband only ordered the 20 oz. Because of the long wait and the extreme hunger he was suffering from, my husband decided to forget about it and just dive in. To add to our disappointment, both of our steaks were lukewarm and dry. To make up for the long wait for our entrees, the server offered desert to all of us free of charge. Each of our group of four ordered one desert, with my husband ordering the peanut butter pie (saltier than others Ie had), and I ordering the caramel pie. Each was very good, and came out quicker than our entrees. The gesture by the server would have been more appreciated had the key lime pie one of our friends ordered wasn frozen solid in the middle. *sigh*The ambiance was lovely, the crab claws are a unique treat, but the overall experience was less then stellar. Although I would be willing to give this place another try down the road, I do hope that their customer service, as well as the food greatly improves to match the national recognition that their restaurant name brings to the table., Joes is old school meets new school, Washington glam.Youve got the beautiful ivory columns, an army of wait staff and a vibe that will have you wondering when the bugle boy will appear surrounded by The Rat Pack. Not sure if the restaurant just looked a little sparce or if its just that sprawling, but I was surprised to see a relatively modest number of diners just a few days after their grand opening. Oh well. Just gave us a little more wiggle room to act inappropriate and play with our food. We started things off with drinks (great cocktail and wine list) and then onto The Whale - a carefully, displayed selection of Florida Stone Crab, Alaskan King Crab, Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche. Amazing. All of it. Not only was it beautiful to look at, it was so enjoyable to eat.(Although I think we were all holding back, trying to be polite and conservative when we all just wanted to shovel it all onto our plates and eat with our fingers.) For a group of five people, it was just enough to for everyone to experience a taste. For a smaller party, it will be much more filling.After being completely indecisive about what entree to order, I finally confidently decided on the Lobster Stuffed Sole with Spinach, Fennel Cream, Trumpet Mushrooms. Sounds frickin fantastic, right?! Well, unfortunately they were out. In a self-imposed rush, I quickly skimmed the menu and pretty much just named the first thing I saw that sounded tasty after that: The Petite Filet Mignon.Why I ordered that? I dont know. Im not a huge steak girl, but from time to time I gets busy with it. Unfortunately, this day I could not. I ordered the steak medium and while the inside came out medium well, the outside was much too overcooked to the point where it tasted burnt and dry. I could have just sent it back, but with all of the delicious sides we ordered, I knew I would have enough to eat. Speaking of sides, I had been eyeing up the Wild Mushroom Mac & Cheese before I even arrived at the restaurant, so you know that went down. It was delicious. And if youd like to appease your mother by eating your veggies, why not throw her a curve ball by ordering the fried asparagus? (Gotcha, Mom!)Everything else, from arrival to departure was incredible with a blatant emphasis on service. Ill definitely be back soon to enjoy some of their totally reasonable happy hour specials!, Took a large group here - had a nicely secluded private room upstairs including a private bar for cocktails. First off - what a setting! Gorgeous old bank building with tons of character. We had selected a prix fix menu - various appetizers (including the Moby Dick - stone crabs, shrimp, Alaska King crab legs) - it was excellent. Entrees were a mix of seafood (I had a wonderful piece of salmon), filet, etc. everyone raved about them. Sides are for the table - creamed spinach, etc. Service was impeccable and they handled our group of 25 expertly. What a wonderful, high end place for lunch, dinner, or a special occasion. Cant beat the setting!, This place gets booked early, but fills late. Had reservations, but when we got there, it was barely full....for awhile. Theres a huge bar area, the main dining room, and several party rooms. Started with a Mojito. Nice presentation, but couldnt taste much alcohol. A lot of ice in the drink.For starters, had the Large Stone Crab Claws ($65) and Oysters Rockefeller. I was considering the Whale ($25/person), but I came for the stone crab claws, not shrimp cocktail, crab legs, or ceviche. Also had a Wedge Salad which was good. The Oysters Rockefeller is a must try.For the entr39e, we went with the Lamb Chops ($50) entr39e and the crabcake entr39e. The lamb chops with the chimichurri sauce was incredible. Cooked raw plus. Ala carte sides include 1/2 portion of the onion strings and 1/2 portion of the mac n cheese with wild mushroom. I found the mac n cheese to be too creamy.Everything was great and service was super friendly. Ambiance was warm, comfortable, and relaxed., This restaurant is like no other in DC. The service is spectacular and the food is amazing. Since its opening in January I have been there over 5 times. Each time I try something different on the menu. And I can confidently say that everything I have had was delicious.I dont write reviews but I am now because restaurants like this deserve good press.Try the crab studded shrimp and banana cream pie with foster sauce. Perfection!, Service was excellent Shrimp appetizer - shrimp were tough. My steak was dry /medium rare felt like it waited a while before being brought to the table.Ambiance and decor really swanky, clean and refreshing.Nothing like Miami.Will definitely go back., beautiful place.my family arrived at 8:15 for an 8:30 reservation. we werent seated until closer to 8:50. my bone in rib eye was good. i didnt need sauce with my steak, and i am a trashy fan of A1, no matter where Im sitting for my steak. I had to take it home and still loved eating it after it was cold the next morning (im NEVER like this). the medium rare was a little on the well done side crusty side though. the sides were very mediocre and looked like they had sat under a lamp. the lobster tail was the best my mother had ever eaten, and shes picky. my sister loved the stone crab. as with anywhere, calimari can be gross or fantastic, it was fantastic here. i would come back for future special occasions- as in for the comfort of the ambiance and service and less so for the food., Really enjoyed our visit to Joes Stone Crab in DC. I took my wife for her birthday, and it was great for a special occasion dinner. It looks like most reviewers had good service there, and I will echo that. The wait staff was top notch and absolutely went out of their way to make it feel like a special dinner. Our food was excellent from start to finish. We had some fantastic oysters, an order of stone crabs (which are so worth trying if you have never enjoyed them), delicious scallops and a chocolate pie for dessert. The side dishes were fantastic too. You order and share them. We had mashed potatoes and fried asparagus, both of which we enjoyed almost as much as the seafood. The stone crabs are really a treat though. Ive had them once before in Florida, and its just not something you see in our area. The restaurant itself is very classy looking and feels very appropriate to that area of DC. I prefer it (and really the whole restaurant) to the nearby DC Coast.The menu is fairly expensive. I would certainly return again on a special night, just not a restaurant I would be likely to visit regularly., This restaurant is amazing! I went for my birthday for the weekend. The decor of the restaurant is really nice. We got the mussels and the Alaskan King crab. Both were very delicious. We had to ask for the crab to be steamed but it was done very well. The service was excellent and very friendly. I definitely recommend going here on a special occasion., I went to the opening and have been back once. I love this restaurant. As someone who lived in Miami Beach for 13 years I am a fan of the Joes restaurants but this one is GORGEOUS. The ambiance is amazing. The food was wonderful and the service was spectacular!, Underwhelming experience. Kids food not great for kids. Service was inattentive. Stone crabs were great and so was tenderloin. It took two hours to eat lunch., This was a very nice spot after work only a 15 min wait and the host would walk around and give us updates on our wait. Our server was great; making good recommendations. Our table was never wanting for drinks from the sharply dressed waiters. Our food was very good as well. I enjoyed their Mahi Mahi; it was nicely done. The pies do deserve their excellent reputation., Update: We have been back several times since our original visits, including tonight. Finally tried the bone-in Filet Mignon. It was amazing. Service was spot-on as usual. Drinks were still as strong., Great food. Awesome ambiance. Superb Service. Not a thing bad to say about this place., Definitely a solid 4.5 stars. BEAUTIFUL inside (especially the main room with marble pillars, palms, and a gorgeous bar), mostly incredible food, and impeccable service.We had reservations with a big group and had to wait a bit long, so they immediately brought us a big basket of chilled crab and lobster legs, and fried calamari, to apologize for the wait. I hope theyre late seating us again, because everything was delicious and we thought this was a really nice touch.Split the rib eye steak with my bf and we were in love. The mashed potato side was meh, but I stole a few bites of my friends crab bisque, and let me tell you, I could bathe in this stuff. I will seriously go back just for this, it was heaven in a bowl.The wait staff was very friendly and attentive (rare for DC) and had no qualms with splitting the check at the end of the night. Beautiful spot for a special occasion, or to bring parents in town who are paying the bill.... ;), From the moment you walk in - prepare to judge and be judged. This is a high end place, so be careful wearing anything other than a stellar cocktail dress with a pair of heels. Me, dressed in my smart casual, certainly did not feel comfortable. And me definitely got a certain look from a host and it was far from welcoming. On a Thursday night it felt like the whole upper class DC, congressmen, sleek businessmen and ambassadors alike, with their significant others, gathered here to indulge in talks about politics, kids colleges and last night at the opera. Crabs, steaks, lobsters, and scallops moved across the dining room with a speed of sound. Service was top notch and very professional, but hardly personal or easy flowing. Seafood was of a great quality, very fresh and tasty. Nothing too innovative, very classic, with a great selection of both the raw bar and entrees. Still, I could not get over the fact how uneasy and uptight this place was and how much I did not fit into the crowd. I am certainly willing to give it another try (and this time with a proper outfit). But for my taste - I prefer something more easy going and personal, where I can feel relaxed, laugh with my friends and chat about silly stuff., The place is beautiful- the big pillars and the high ceiling set the tone for opulence. We went at 10pm on a Friday after the ballet. The dining room was packed. The bread basket offered four kinds of bread. The crispy Parmesan cracker was difficult to stop eating; it had assagio cheese on it. The biscuit was equally addictive. Our waiter took our drink order; he knew his vodkas when questioned. They had blue cheese stuffed olives. I ordered a dirty martini and it was perfect.We started with 5 large stone crabs for $64. They are delicious. I thought they were going to be bigger though. Next we split a green salad. We asked for dressing on the side. It came as requested and was delicious. The green salad consisted of all kinds of greens- nothing else. The dressing was very flavorful. We ordered for our main the special of the night, Alaskan halibut, and 2 sides: cauliflower and the Mac and cheese. Everything was great. The cauliflower stole the show. The Mac and cheese was very good and readily packed up for lunch the next day. The halibut was cooked perfectly and was cooked as described but had a lot of cracked pepper on it. I am not a fan of cracked pepper. We let the waiter know.Our waiter, Ryan, was a true professional. He had the right balance of linger and chat vs just hustle to get our food/drink. And he had a pleasant demeanor. We ordered the bananas foster pie after consulting Yelp! And the tres leches dessert (aka Havana Dream) after the recommendation of Jose V. Our waiter also brought us the coconut cream pie. Wow those desserts were amazing! All are homemade in house and it shows. We were the very last to leave to restaurant yet we never felt rushed. Ever., Bring some money! the food is excellent and fresh. Drinks are very strong., What a fantastic addition to DC venues. There is no place like Joes Stone Crab. This restaurant decor is traditional and gorgeous dark wood, the design and layout is impressive. The staff are well trained and the service is consistent. The food of course is delicious and perfectly cooked and presented. No place has Stone Crabs in DC... though some might think they do. The steaks and seafood are exquisite and the other fare is superb. Prices are excellent value for example highest quality Surf & Turf, 8oz Filet and Lobster Tail, $67.00, dont waste your money at a Mortons or R Chris. Add to this the ambiance and decor and cant beat it for the price. You can have this experience only in Vegas or Miami, ok and Chicago, where the other Joes Stone Crabs are located., Fabulous place! Excellence steak, king crab, shrimp, oyster and delicious key lime pie that to die for! Exceptional costumer service service, a place to be! Great for happy hour, a great place to bring your client for lunch or dinner, dinner date , etc.Power scene. Some high rank/ VIP/ important government officials have dine here more than once. Great dining party space. Black an white decor. Sleek and classy. I love the tufted round dining bench at the bar room. Highly recommended! And I definitely come back here for more! :), I actually could go with ***** here, but its just snooty enough where I cant. The food is phenomenal and expensive as you would expect. But, for a special night, you cannot go wrong here. Everything surf and turf was great. Excellent bartender and the best Old Fashion Ive had in this town (even better than Passenger - saying a lot). I had king crab legs and my wife a surf and turf of filet cooked perfectly and snow crab legs. All were great. The star is in the titular, though. The snow crab is beyond this world I would give all the food *** 1/2, but the stone crabs are a ********! The accompanying aioli or sauce is a perfect complement to the crab crack sweetness of the stone crabs. Expensive and gone fast, but worth it. I even threw in an extra claw with my meal I was feeling so decadent. Caveat; the place does size you up as to how important you may or may not be, but the servers try and hide that even if the hostess/host doesnt. Our server was great, but I saw some more indifferent service around us. D39cor is a bit over-the-top, and that PA announcing your reservation is an odd interruption of the aesthetic there, but its about the food and that is top of the park. Bring your credit card., This place is absolutely outstanding in every way. The food is phenomenal. Is it pricey? Yes. Is it worth it for that special occasion? Yes. Joes is definitely a high-end establishment, and I would recommend dressing accordingly. No need for an evening gown, but this isnt a jeans and a t-shirt kind of place. And do not forget to order a piece of pie! I dont care how stuffed you are!, Delicious food, excellent customer service, and well attended staff. Highly recommend Joes and will be back for sure., Great food and outstanding service. Id recommend everything I had especially including the stuffed mushrooms and filet oscar (a special). Dessert was also awesome. They sell half slices of pie for about $1 more than half the price so you can try more. The apple and banana cream were both delicious., The food and ambience are great. The staff were all very attentive. Seafood salad is to die for and the lobster tails were very tender., Ive been to the one in Vegas and thought it was very good. I think the DC establishment is amazing. It simply does not get better than this if you truly love and appreciate high-end, high-quality food. Everything was cooked to perfection. From the skirt steak to the stone crabs, Alaskan King crab legs...PERFECT.So perfect we are going back this Saturday night. A MUST go, no question., This is a glorified RSL (an Aussie cheap local club). Fried, unfresh and unpalatable food. Big disappointment... Obviously all the reviews from yelp are staff members. As my first review I feel strongly to inform others not to dine here., Good prices for downtown DC (most carft beers around $6, half dozen oysters $15, great tuna sandwich w/ sweet potato fries $16), awesome building (columns, double high ceilings, wrap-around bar), very attentive service, restaurant mgr opening the doors, super luxe bathrooms, HH till 6:30. Old Ebbit, watch out!One star below five for the abundance of black suit expense-account eggheads, but hey, this is gov central, so what do you expect? Also, no outdoor area., The best meal and service Ive had in a long time. Potato crusted grouper so tender and full of flavor. Filet that melts like butter in your mouth. The only wrong note were the grilled tomatoes, totally ruined with gloppy creamed spinach and cheese. Steer clear., Fabulous place. . I sat at the bar, cause I was by myself, and enjoyed the perfect dinner. Had the petite Filet mignon a side of the Mac and cheese with broccoli, was delicious! The service, Chuck my Bartender was amazing. . He was so kind and friendly I felt like we were old friends by the time I left... Definitely first class service. Thank you Chuck! This is a place to bookmark on your yelp.., Great service and the crabs were wonderful. I had the crab cakes for dinner. They were flaky and not full of filler. Just perfect! There were 8 of us and the service was wonderful., Early dinner this evening. Our server Patrick and his assistants were fantastic. Offered great suggestions and anticipated our needs. They were very sweet to my 7 year old and were on top of everything all night. We ordered the large stone crabs and really enjoyed them. The sea bass with bok choy was excellent! That was the favorite item of our party of four. The crab stuffed shrimp and butter poached lobster were also delicious. The sea bass was just so yummy with just the right amount of seasoning and cooked perfectly. The lobster tail was ridiculously big. It was 22 oz. but perfectly tender and not rubbery at all. Our sides were all good but nothing stood out. We had roasted corn, mac & cheese, spinach saut39ed with garlic, and the fried asparagus. The key lime pie is AMAZING!!! It was the star out of the 3 we chose. The banana cream was yummy too but the Havana pie was not our thing. Patrick even removed it from our bill after realizing we didnt enjoy it. The key lime was so awesome we ordered a second slice. Expensive but totally worth it for a special occasion or if your corporate card is picking up the tab. The restaurant is also very kid friendly as long as yours are well behaved. They have a kids menu (and crayons) with your typical kids stuff for the picky eaters. Unfortunately for our wallets, our 7 year old is a little foodie so we had to order off the adult menu for her., Absolutely loved this place. Came here Tuesday for dinner and entire place was humming ! Super great service !!!, Incredible customer service. I work in the hospitality industry...trust me, this was perfect. Great food, great recommendations, and did I mention the exceptional customer service? Blown away!, Get the stone crabs and the steaks. Hands down the best prepared steak that Ive had in a long long time. The service is fabulous, and the atmosphere is awesome. They have a huge bar area that I would highly recommend if youre not looking for the super upscale dining room experience. Stay away from the seafood chopped salad; it wasnt appetizing. The cocktails are delicious as well. Highly recommend this place for a date, happy hour, or to impress business people., OK, so disclaimer: Washington culinary scene has come a long way in the last few years. Gone are the days where DC cuisine was defined solely by lobbyists on K eating 36 Oz. Angus steaks at lunch before they go back to VA. 9th st, Barracks Row, 14th St, U St and more have grown into unique pockets of foodie fun. And we love them. That said, Joes is one of those old DC places, and I love it. Sometimes you just want a waiter in a tie that has been around the block, has an old school personality. And you want a BIG martini. And a big plate of uncreative, yet delicious straightforward food. Awesome bar(s), great service, fun atmosphere, and very good seafood. Stop being soooooooo trendy and go have a good time., Came here for my Mothers birthday. Both my parents had been here several times and love the place. All the food was wonderful. We started with stone crabs as an appetizer, and I ordered a filet for my entree with a side of mashed potatoes. I had a taste of king crab as well which was excellent! The only reason I am knocking one star off is the server we had. He wasnt very attentive and he seemed like he wasnt paying full attention since he was getting drink orders wrong. He also wasnt very knowledgeable about the food because my mother was telling him about things that could be done that werent on the menu since she had it that way previously on earlier visits., I love this place! Was there for a birthday dinner, we ordered half shell, shrimp cocktail , asparagus for appetizer and crab cakes, seabass, scallops and shrimp for entry. Must try the seabass, its so fresh and tasty !, One of my favorite restaurants!You must order the King crab legs... I almost ate it all by myself (dont worry I shared with my guest). Ribeye was charred perfectly and their seasoning was just right.Key lime pie was delicious. The crust was thick, which I love.Women: be careful in your heels, the floor is slippery. Enjoy!, Arrived at Joes Stone Crabs for a 8:30 reservation. They were out of Stone Crabs. To make up for it, we got 4 drinks on the house, plus an appetizer of alaskan king crabs. The filet was incredible. Really one of the best steaks Ive had in a long time. If they were not out of Stone Crabs, this would easily be a 5 star meal. I will definitely be back though., Absolutely amazing, I have nothing negative to say about our experience here. My husband went to law school in Chicago and hasnt visited one in 5-6 years, I had dinner at Joes in Chicago in August 2012 -- and I must say, the DC one does an even better job.My husband and I had made a reservation for 9pm this past Wednesday, upon arriving at the restaurant we were sat immediately. I went ahead and ordered a Ketel One martini, this one was probably one of the best I have ever tasted. The drink was mixed perfectly.To start we ordered the chowder which my husband and I shared. We didnt look at the menu close enough and when it was delivered to our table we realized it wasnt a NE chowder, but instead a Manhattan clam chowder -- delicious nonetheless.We then ordered a surf and turf (petit filet with king crab legs). The filet was cooked perfectly (rare) and the crab legs were meaty and DELICIOUS. For sides we ordered the fire roasted corn (on special) and creamed spinach. Every bite of every dish was perfect.Decor: 5 stars. Service: 4.5 stars. Overall experience: 5 stars. We will be back!, Service fantastic.Atmosphere outstanding.Stone crabs was easily as good as the original in Miami.Not the cheapest place in town but well worth it.
31|kinship-washington|Its early days for this restaurant so Im giving them slack on things that Im sure will improve with time. The service was little weird, for example, but they are still figuring it out. Ill break down what we ordered individually because my opinion was all over the map. In order of appearance: - Cauliflower - 3 stars - Very tasty but serving size was way too small. The menu was designed for sharing but there was not enough on the plate to share.- Parmigiano Reggiano Agnolotti - 4 stars - This was a great dish. Lamb bacon, cream sauce, cheesy pasta. Nothing here not to love.- Kinship Stroganoff - 5 stars - Exceptional. Sweatbreads cooked to perfection.- Duck - 3.5 stars - Good but I wont remember it tomorrow- Roast Chicken - 5 stars - Exceptional. You have to order this if you go to Kinship. Who orders chicken at a restaurant? Not me. Never. But this time ... do it. - Chocolate chip cookie dough souffle - 1.5 star - This was not good. It tasted like eggs with chocolate chips in them. Giving it an extra half star because the sweet milk ice cream served on the side was a standout. - Sticky toffee pudding - 2 stars - More lemony than I would have liked. It was just meh. I will go back once its a little more established. Really enjoyed it overall and I trust Eric Ziebold to do great work!Oh, and needless to say, the Parker House rolls were incredible. :), Celia and her husband, Chef Eric Ziebold, have created simply the best restaurant in DC. Celias gifted touch is seen in the personalized decor, atmosphere and ambiance, and her attention to detail is evident in impecable service. Chef Eric prepared undoubtedly the most exciting, delicious and surprising meal I think I have ever enjoyed, and I cannot wait to return to this new Shaw hot spot to indulge in the downstairs, fireside tasting menu., One of the best meals Ive ever had, with impeccable service. Ive worked with Celia and this doesnt surprise me as her standards of service are high. She made me a better server at my restaurant when she worked there. Mr Zeibolds food was out of this world, so good that we ordered a second round of entrees even though we were full from the first round. (We also got appetizers)Somehow we found the strength to eat dessert despite full stomachs. In short eat here before it becomes the hardest place to get a table in DC. Hats off to this gem of the highest order., Stumbled upon this place looking for somewhere to eat after leaving Bar 7. Everything we had was amazing!, A true 5 star experience from the decor, service and most of all food. We have worked with Darryl Carter on a number of projects throughout the years and it is so gratifying to see him grow into designing magnificent spaces for special restaurants like kinship. His taste is impeccable and the restaurant creates an ambiance of modern, chic, upscale yet cozy that is the perfect setting for the amazing food. We sat at a table but the banquettes are so cute and will request one for next time. Onto the food, which we tried a variety of and were really impressed with everything. The lobster french toast was a stand out as was the mushroom torchon. The agnolotti was also rich but not overly so and simply delicious. They brought a crusty warm bread to the table which was so satisfying. We wanted to try the roast chicken but were advised it takes an entire hour to prepare because it is made to order. We had a later reservation so opted for the turbot to share. They bring the entree to you and show you the whole fish before plating it. In this instance, for the fish dishes it may be better to just bring out the filet fish instead because it arrived kind of cold. However, we have never tried turbot before and enjoyed the white fish that is hearty and has a lot of meat to it. The cute little parker house rolls were buttery and perfect to soak up the sauce.Finally, we ordered the two chocolate options for dessert. Mine was the darker chocolate one and came with an ice cream that had a crunchy toffee underneath and tasted as good as it sounds. Although I think the toffee you break with the little hammer only comes with a coffee drink our waitress brought one over for me any as a celebration. Overall, I feel excited DC has a true 5 star restaurant added to its selection, one that offers the whole experience. We already have plans to go back and I cant wait to try more things on the menu., Spectacular evening at Kinship. We were fans of Chef Ziebold at Cityzen and were eager to see him open his own spot. From the service to the divine foie gras with duck scrapple, everything was flawless. We won be back every night - this food is way too rich to eat all the time - but the relatively accessible prices ($260 pre-tax and tip for 2 including a bottle of mid range wine, a digestif, foie gras and dessert) were reasonable enough that this won remain a special occasion restaurant. Execution and plating were lovely, and the turbot, foie gras, Hungarian sauerkraut and sticky toffee pudding were absolute hits with us. The food was cuisine-y and contemporary without being overly precious and the portions were lovely - not too big, not too small, totally shareable without a contrived feeling of tapas style dining. The decor is also lovely and simple which lets the food really shine.We were lucky enough to spend a lot of time with their vivacious, down to earth and super knowledgeable somm, Kerstin, who had us taste an old world style wine made in California (perfect balance between my love of Burgundy and my boyfriend love of California Cabs), Amaros, Ports, and even a Virginia made quinquina. We also had a long chat with Chef Ziebold who is lovely, passionate about food and totally down to earth. We saw him make the rounds towards the end of the evening and he spoke with every table there about his food, his vision, and the tasting room he will be opening next door, Metier. It was truly a privilege to get to speak with such a talented chef who doesn court the spotlight like some of his cohorts in DC. All of the staff was gracious and professional but still very friendly from the hostess, to the bartender, to our server, to Chef lovely wife who made the rounds and helped service in that old French bistro sort of way which was charming.We are already planning our next visit for next month and are particularly excited to see what Chef Ziebold does with spring and summer ingredients., RUN, do not walk to Kinship before everyone finds out how fabulous it is and you cant get in! From the decor, to the women at the front desk, to the service, to the amazing food, it is everything you want in a restaurant. AND even more amazing, you can actually have a conversation without screaming at the person next to you. The chef came out to meet us and you can tell that he has his heart and soul into this restaurant. It pays off in spades and Washingtonians are the big winner., Kinship had excellent appetizers and solid entrees, along with a spacious interior and inventive menu.I visited with a friend on Saturday night with no reservations. The restaurant offers the full menu at the bar (but not at cocktail tables), so we had a round of drinks while waiting about 45 minutes for two seats at the bar to turn over. During that time, a bar waitress gave us great service: she watched for seats and gave us a heads up when they were turning over, and also explained the menu to us while we waited. The restaurants decor is classic, clean, and spacious. Its a white and black color scheme with plain walls and few adornments. Theres also a small waiting area at the front of the restaurant. Compared to so many other restaurants, which have bustling bars and rooms packed with tables, Kinships spaciousness was refreshing. We both agreed our appetizers were excellent, and the main courses only good. We had the Mushroom Torchon and Aoyagi Clams to start, followed by the Stroganoff and the Seared Duck. I would have easily mistaken the vegetarian torchon for one made with meat. My duck was good, and the fermented black bean sauce very interesting, but it ultimately lacked something (like a grain).I was disappointed by the bread basket. It was a good but wholly unremarkable white loaf with regular butter. The rest of the menu was so inventive and appealing that such boring bread and spread really sticks out. The toasted brioche served with the torchon was much better.We skipped dessert but Kinship is very much deserving of a second visit., For those who are former fans of Eric Ziebolds excellent CityZen, Kinship is a much-awaited, tremendous return of one of the best chefs in DC. And for those never had the good fortune of dining at CityZen, Kinship is a fantastic opportunity to splurge a bit and enjoy a great meal and top notch cocktails.One note - despite Kinship being marketed as the more relaxed cousin to Ziebolds forthcoming fine dining establishment - the feel remains formal (maybe not as much as CityZen ... but pretty close).Bottom line, every dish was impressively delicious, the menu is quite versatile, and if youre looking to drop $$$ on a fun meal - Kinship is head and shoulders above most of the competition, and in line with Roses, Little Serow, Grill Room, and the Red Hen - to give you a sense of the quality level.If youre a foodie, just go. Shoot, even if youre not but you love good food, go., Outstanding meals (2 times within the first 3 weeks) at Erics new place...a wonderful follow on to CityZen. The place has a clean, simple, yet refined feel to it, and the staff seems far more polished than a restaurant that has just opened up.Dishes tasted were the stroganoff (with fantastic veal sweetbreads), parmigiano reggiano agnolotti (with perfect lamb bacon), white truffle tagliatelle, Maine lobster French toast, quail stuffed with foie gras and topped with truffles, roast chicken (amazingly delicious), dry aged ribeye. All the dishes were expertly prepared and presented. On subsequent visits I would always get the stroganoff (prepared slightly differently both times based upon what mushrooms he has), and I would always hope to have someone who wanted to share the roast chicken which I think rivals Frank Rutas for the best in DC., With its white textured walls, dim lighting and beautiful furniture, Kinship has a modern and classy atmosphere worthy of a special night out. Kinship menu divides dishes into five categories -- Craft (requiring extra skill or technique) History (classic dishes), Ingredients (seasonal dishes), Indulgence (treats and desserts) and For the Table (dishes to share). Our waitress described the first few dishes in each category to be appetizer portions while the last few in each category are more entree sized.We ordered several dishes including the Maine lobster french toast, warm smoked sturgeon, hungarian sauerkraut, and the chocolate chip cookie dough souffle. The Maine lobster french toast was my favorite and is an absolute must order. Rich, decadent and flavorful, this dish is a definite indulgence that will leave you wanting more. The warm smoked sturgeon was light and different. It actually didn taste like fish at all as the the fish tasted much meatier. The sturgeon was paired with an apple and onion fondue which was light and fruity and complemented the fish well. The chocolate chip cookie dough souffle with the milk ice cream, while pricey for a dessert, was excellent. I loved that they took everyone favorite childhood dessert of cookies and milk and turned it into a fancy dessert. I not surprised that this place is getting a lot of buzz -- Kinship impressed., Went back to Kinship a second time, and it was just as spectacular. Since it was a birthday celebration, we started out with a glass of champagne. My wife and I then had cocktails -- I had the American Quarter (cross between a Manhattan and an Old-Fashioned) and my wife had a Rumaccino, both were delicious. We started with the Maine Lobster French Toast, which we had the first time we were there, and it was even better than I had remembered. Our second dish was the Oeuf a la Brick Au Thon, which was a revelation. We then had the Roast Chicken, which was outstanding, and we finished off with the Pineapple Crumb Cake and Cream Cheese Ice Cream. Kinship is a phenomenal place. We were also pleased to hear that Metier will be opening soon in the lower level. Cant wait to try that too. Eric Zielbolds creations are an absolute must for any foodie and Kinship is a perfect place for date night., Birthday dinner gone so so right. Everything about this places shouts excellence. The decor exudes a modern, dimly lit, wooden warmth. The service is impeccable. From the coat check when you walk in, to the constant yet noninvasive attention from waiters, to the chef himself -- you know that theyve brought in the best of the best. The food was worth the hype. I cant do justice in words for the flavors, presentation, and thoughtfulness of each dish. Highlights for us were the agnolotti, torchon of mushroom, and stroganoff. They even brought out a little birthday cake ice cream treat for me., Exceeded my expectations which were already high. Kinship is going to be one of DCs top rated restaurants in no time. The food was all phenomenal - so perfectly executed with great flavors and lots of creativity. We had the mushroom torchon (insanely delicious and well balanced dish - better than many foie gras dishes Ive had), confit tuna with eggs and an amazing crispy wafer (beautiful dish that unexpectedly made so much sense and just killed it in terms of flavor - probably my favorite of the night), lobster French toast (obviously delicious and less rich than you would expect - in a good way), truffled tagliatelle (SO. MANY. TRUFFLES.), and the roasted chicken which was everything a roasted chicken should be (served with salad and duck fat fried potatoes). The service was awesome - unrushed, friendly, and highly knowledgeable. The place looks amazing - minimalist decor but exudes a comfortable warmth that makes you feel at home. Thrilled to have Kinship as part of the dining scene in DC., I made a reservation a month out to dine here. I was called twice to confirm my reservation . The night of the reservation the restaurant decided to close because of inclement weather which is completely understandable. What i dont understand is the fact that so much effort is put into making the guest accountable for broken reservations ( cancellation fees etc) And there is no accountablity for the Front of House not notifying guests when the restaurant has too cancel. I drove in through the snow to make sure that I was on time for my 830p reservation. When I arrived, the restaurant had a CLOSED sign on the door. I was very excited to dine with Kinship and to my dismay it didnt happen. The FOH should have contacted all of the reservations for the evening after they decided to close down for business. Driving back home in the bad weather after being turned down without notice left a very bad taste in my mouth. I understand that the safety of the staff and future patrons trumps keeping the doors open but sufficient notice is not too much to ask in this situation. I still wish to come back to Kinship and dine because I am a fan of the concept and their team. I just wasnt a fan of how they handled the cancelled reservations for that evening, We live in the neighborhood, so my fianc39 and I decided to do Valentines Day dinner here. I was sadly disappointed in the meal, though my fianc39 gave it higher marks. I thought it was generally overpriced for what it was and the service was mediocre. The tuna was so-so but I did enjoy the duck. I also was given a dirty wine glass (could see lip imprints from the last person). As far as the restaurant space itself, the ambiance felt a little too stuffy and the tables seemed very close together. The clientele was also much older than is typical for restaurants in this part of town (we are early 30s and most other diners were 50-60+). Despite my gripes, I do plan to go back and give Kinship another try at some point., I dont know about their food, but when myfriend and I ate their dessert (the choc chip souffle among others) we were amazed. Additionally, my friend forgot their ID and went to get it so the souffle deflated but my bartender who was to generous gave us another freshly made one. Amazing bar service, amazing dessert- could not have asked for more. Definitely coming here many many moretimes., I cannot emphasize enough how excited we were to try Kinship! The chefs credentials are impressive seeing as he worked at French Laundry for 8 years a 3 Michelin star rated restaurant. PROS:The food is delicious and beautiful. The wines the sommelier recommended were great. The ambiance and decor is fine dining but comfortable, not formal, not stuffy. Contemporary modern. Our waiter was so gracious to find a dairy substitute when I mentioned I was lactose intolerant and asked if they had something other than milk or half and half for my coffee. Although the restaurant did not carry anything else, he went above and beyond and found that the pastry chef had some fresh coconut milk! Worked out great. I chitchatted with some of the other servers the in the restaurant who were all genuinely friendly and attentive. CONS:First, we placed our order and two minutes later the sommelier arrived and she made suggestions about what wines would pair well and so we placed our order for the glasses. As soon as she left, the bread arrived and I was about to take a bite of a piece when our appetizers arrived. I appreciate them being attentive but I felt a little overwhelmed. I had not had time to take everything in or really talk to my boyfriend since before we had been seated. Everything was happening so quickly. Our appetizers were placed but we just sat there for a few minutes while our food was getting cold because our wine had still not arrived. The sommelier came and poured a glass of the red wine I requested. I was irritated because, as any good sommelier will tell you, you should let red wines have time to sit a breathe a little before drinking them. So I had to make a choice: cold food so I can let the wine breathe and enjoy the wine as it is meant to be enjoyed or hot food and drink wine as is? I waited to enjoy the food. What was the harm? It has cooled a little already anyway while I had to wait for her to bring the bottle out. This issue with bringing the food and then having us wait a little bit for our wine happened again with the entree. Ie never been to a restaurant where the wine is poured after the food has been served. Is this a DC thing? We moved here a 1.5 years ago from NYC. So I legitimately wondering if I missing something. Second, one of the servers seemed very confused. She brought our one shared plate of dessert to a table of 6 people next to us and thought it belonged to them. They looked confused but our waiter saw this and corrected her so she brought it over to us. During the appetizer and entree portion of the meal, the only two parts of the meal where my boyfriend and I ordered different things, she mixed up who ordered what. She seemed genuinely confused about everything. I would like to chalk it up to just her but later that night when the entrees for that table came out and the servers were placing their plates in front of them, the patrons were switching them around saying that they were for the wrong person. May have just been an off night.NOTE: If you are a foodie, you will understand what I about to say as a CON....Third, the bread basket. The bread basket was a slice of cold bread that could have been a loaf of bread I bought from Giant grocery store and sliced. True that you don come here for the bread of all things but there is an expectation that carries through from the moment you step through the door, from start to end. You expect it in your food, service and in the ambiance of the restaurant. That is what you were promised and that is what you are paying for. Imagine youe just finished a decadent meal in the cozy dining room at Kinship, where the service was impeccable and you are in good company discussing how great everything was. You ask the server where the restroom is and you walk towards the back of the restaurant and upon entering the restroom you find those bathroom stalls from high school, paint peeling and some puddles on the floor. See my example below. The bathroom isn what you came to Kinship for but my point is that as a business owner if youe going to do something, wouldn you want to give it 100%? Your customers are going to notice the tiny detail you neglected. They may not care too much about it but they will remember it. In my example, you don come to Kinship for the bathroom but if the rest of the restaurant was made to be so beautiful than why wouldn you just go that little more to fix up a nicer bathroom. It wouldn take that much effort or cost that much to spruce up one piece or bread. All in all I would go back. Maybe they just need to work out some of the kinks. Il just be sure to speak up next time and request that the wine be poured at least a few minutes prior to my dish being served., If I spend $200 on dinner for two-- without alcohol--I want to feel particularly wowed, and while the dishes were good, the service was rather slow. My favorite item was dessert: sticky toffee pudding ($12). I could smell the warm butterscotch sauce the moment the waitress poured it around the cake, and it tasted as good as it smelled. The earl grey ice cream balanced out the sweetness of the sauce. I often find desserts to be a bit of a let-down, but this made me really want to try their other desserts, which also sounded really good. I was most looking forward to the lobster french toast ($30), which was just as luxurious and buttery as Id hoped. I know its weird to wish for anything other than more lobster in a dish, but I actually liked the pairing of the french toast with the lobster and thought there could have been a little bit more bread. The sashimi ($30) was fine but I think I just have no real appreciation for raw fish. The agnolotti ($18) was yummy; cheesy sauce just oozed out of the pockets of pasta in the best way, and the fatty, smoky lamb bacon was a great pairing. The roast chicken ($56) wasnt as magical as other people said, but certainly had a lot of lemon-garlic flavor. There was something stuffed under the skin that I couldnt quite identify but didnt seem to add much to the dish. I really liked the frisee salad; they mix the dark meat of the chicken, the greens and a light, Asian-tasting dressing. The crispy potatoes were fine and the teeny-tiny parker house rolls were salty and buttery and little clouds of delight. The problem was, everything moved super slowly. We had a 6 p.m. reservation and werent done until around 8:30. The table next to us (also a two-top), ordered after us and got all of their dishes faster than us. We spent a lot of time just twiddling our thumbs. After we got our bread, the sashimi came relatively quickly, there was a lull until we got the agnolotti and lobster, and then a very long time before we got our chicken (I think the busboy felt bad for us so he offered two more slices of bread while we waited). Our neighbors seemed to always have food on their table and even managed to have a very long conversation about the cheese course with the waiter, get their cheese, and then finish with a souffle within the same time. It was good to try once but probably not worth going back again., This is the best restaurant in DC right now PERIOD. END OF STORY. GOODNIGHT CLEVELAND. GOODBYE FELICIA.We have always been fans of Chef Ziebold, and Cityzen was our special occasion spot. Now I understand what he is capable of when he is completely running the show in his own spot. The space, the service, the food...SUBLIME.First things first: we were running late (very late) for our reservation due to DC traffic, and called the restaurant fully expecting to get the we can hold the table for 10 minutes spiel that you get for a hot new place on a Saturday night...What time is eadpoolplaying? We wondered as we made alternative plans. All for naught however when we got a cheerful Of course we can hold it for you until you get here! response from the hostess...our spirits were immediately lifted.What we arrived to is best described as minimalist elegance. Calming grey walls, comfortable seating, and tables spaced widely apart (a rarity when the pack m in and turn it over mentality seems to dominate these days) and an austere decorating scheme that allows to to concentrate on the experience without distraction.Our server could not have been more perfect with a mix of professional knowledge and casual attitude that made us feel immediately at ease.We started with drinks that packed a punch without being too much, and we were not rushed to make any decisions on the menu.Decide we did though: we sampled the Lobster French Toast (A MUST) that was overflowing with lobster, the Tagliatelle with black truffle shaved table side (again - OVERFLOWING with truffles), the Sweetbreads with Spaetzel (the man knows his way around a thalamus gland), the ribeye with scalloped potatoes, (the best piece of cow Ie had in a long time - and I want to bathe in those spuds), and finally the Sticky Toffee Pudding with Earl Gray ice cream (if the spuds aren available, please fill my tub with the butterscotch sauce that goes on top of this one).It not cheap, but I can count on one hand the restaurants in DC that I feel are worth the money, and Kinship is the index finger., We arrived earlier than expected but was glad to know that the table was available. The hostess was friendly and made us feel welcome. The restaurant was not too crowded that time of night but we could not get an earlier table than 9 PM. So it all worked out. We celebrated the birthday with four courses chosen from the flexible menu. The baby bamboo tempura dish it was light and had a fresh citrus note. The sea urchin dish looked good I had a taste of the agnolotti it was a bit salty for me. The sea scallops were cooked to my request but also a bit salty. The duck ballotine looked really good with a mix of meat and ground meat stuffed in duck skin unfortunately the duck skin was not crispy it was a rubbery and fatty. I really liked the celery root tagliatelle under the duck. We shared the 3rd course which was the 12 oz martin ranch dry age ribeye it looked much bigger than I thought it was presented to us in a nice pan and then served with these amazing Parker House rolls, gruyere pudding and grilled asparagus. The sauce dijonaise was so rich with umami it was great with everything on the plate. The grilled asparagus was done just perfectly it was very tasty! For desserts, there was the choux with mango and the chocolate custard cake, it was day and night, one being light and tropical while the other dark and decadent, I enjoyed the praline ice cream with the espelette caramel and pecans. At the end, the server brought out a toffee at first I was not like, it would probably be hard to eat but it turned out to have a slightly softer consistency and the nuts in the toffee made it really good! They served puligny-montrachet and nuit st george by the glass - they were both very good! We really enjoyed the dinner and is looking forward to try the sister restaurant next door soon!, Wee been here twice--once for dinner at the bar, once for a more formal dinner with friends. First things first: the Kinship roast chicken might be the best chicken dish Ie ever had. It comes with a delicious side salad with the leg meat and rolls. It a big dish and worth every penny of the hour wait to cook it and $56.The rest of our dishes have mostly been very good, but the portions are small. We loved the sea urchin pasta and lobster french toast. We didn find the toro to be especially flavorful, and not worth the $30 for such a small portion. The restaurant is definitely more formal and quieter than other hot DC places--more of a place for adults than 20somethings. The service at the bar was okay. The bartender was a nice guy, but didn recognize two pretty common drinks that I ordered and didn seem to have a firm grasp on the menu. The drink I got off the menu didn impress me either.Our waiter for dinner was not especially friendly (almost seemed like he didn want to be there) and we felt like he tried to upsell us during the main course ordering and later for dessert. for dessert, we ordered the souffle--labeled as for the table for dessert and he said just so you know, that going to only be about a bite a person so we ordered another dish. both were fantastic, but the souffle was definitely bigger than a bite per person. Still, Il likely be back for the Kinship roast chicken., Ive mentioned restaurants being on another level, and this is one of them. While daunting to some, I love the way the menu is divided to highlight a different aspect of the dining experience. The thought that the chef put into the menu is reflected in the execution of each dish with flawless technique and powerful flavor. Not to mention the d39cor is gorgeous. This is another one on my list of top 3 restaurants in DC., When we visit our daughter in DC, we try to find new (to us) places and she looks hard for good spots as Dad is paying! She made a res 30 days early for Kinship, as you must, and we had one of the best meals in ages!! The decor is somewhat trendy-stark-contemporary and they only have a very small sign outside, like you find us, we know where we are! The cocktails are excellent, imaginative for the house drinks, and well served. The menu consists of a variety of ways to order by mix and match, sharing, etc. We were told that one entree would suffice for the three of us and we chose the whole roast chicken which takes one hour to prepare as it is made to order. That gave us plenty of time to enjoy three different appetizers delivered one after the other. Scallops, then bamboo shoot tempura, then goat cheese--all incredible with tasty accompaniments--and enough for each of us to be satisfied with each. When the chicken arrived, it was presented whole in a copper pan, then carved at a side table and presented on a large plate to self serve. This was simply the BEST roast chicken we have ever had! Moist, beautiful brown skin, served in easy to eat portions. Enough for 4 so we took some home, along with some of the delicious roast potatoes. Small Parker house rolls accompany and they need nothing to add to them as they melt. In your mouth. Deserts are also imaginative and delicious. There is a ice wine list--by the glass or bottle. Price was not too over the top for what you get. If there a better restaurant in DC, I do not know where it is!, The man knows what he doing. Everything about Kinship is thought out. The interior design feels like your eating in someone home. From the lighting and seats, to the bathrooms, everything just feels so comfortable. The food is just as good as you expect. Between the two of us, we tried the mushroom torchon, tempura, goat cheese, lamb, souffl39, and mouse cake. I wasn blown away by the tempura. The plate consists of one ~3 disk of bamboo shoot fried tempura style, along with some radish slices, small orange wedges, and wedges of more bamboo shoot. The only tempura on the plate was the 3 bamboo disk. Every other dish was awesome though, with the lamb topping my list for savory and the souffl39 taking it for sweet.Speaking of the souffl39, they advertise it as a dish to share, but that bologna. It the size of any other souffl39, and so damn good youe gonna want it all to yourself. Finally, the service was just as good as you expect. No missteps or head scratchers. Just right., Loved every moment of our 3 hr meal. Unique restaurant in DC. Would love to see more like it to follow in DC. Could have done without the crawfish panna cotta., 2.5. If I could copy Sabra R. review here I would because she fully captured how I felt about this yplace and I just don have the energy to go into such detail. The ambiance is very nice here. But the execution on the food was terrible. And I recognize that terrible is being dramatic but the pricing on these dishes warrant that. You better bring it with the small menu and high prices and they do not. I expected to be wowed. The quality of the ingredients i.e. Lobster, rabbit, scallops were solid but it the odd combination or rather ill combination of sauces that just destroyed every dish in my opinion. Places like fainting goat and convivial do a much better job with their small menus and execution., Disappointing meal particularly at the price point. Great space, cool booth setup but server wasnt friendly (other staff were). The meal: lobster French toast (dull flavor), torchon spread (best thing ordered but no wow factor), crayfish pana cotta (gross, sent it back), rabbit (good, not great, disappointing at 60 bucks, though enough for two people). Had high hopes for the meal and left feeling so-so., We were pretty disappointed after all the hype. The space is gorgeous, and it was empty when I showed up a bit early to a 6:00 reservation. I got a drink at the bar and was very underwhelmed by the Wolfhound, which was new to the menu. My friend agreed that the proportions werent quite right, which wasnt a great start to the night. Her Champs Elysees was fantastic though. To go with our early reservation, we noted that we were at most half the average age of the room. By the time we left around 9, the tables were beginning to look a bit more like us. Food - Lobster French Toast was outstanding, although quite small for the price. Im not always a lobster fan, and I thought this one was perfect.Halibut - Nice flavors, although the fish was a bit dry. The vegetables were really well done. Torchon of white mushroom - This was pretty yummy and quite interesting. Essentially a vegetarian pate.Crawfish panna cotta - This was an absolute letdown and we sent most of it back uneaten. It was extremely fishy, and not in a good way. There didnt seem to be any other flavors in there. Cookie dough souffle - I had seen great things about this, so was ready to be wowed. It smelled incredible, but the execution was lacking. In general, presentation was fantastic and many of the ideas were innovative and interesting. But we just found the tastes didnt quite come together as we had hoped. And for the price, you need to deliver. To clarify, food is where I splurge. But that means I expect it to meet or exceed my expectations. Service was a mixed bag. We often waited for service and as others noted, waited between courses for just a bit longer than normal. Plates were delivered well, with a crisp overview of what was in front of you. Final thoughts? Eh., Plan to order one of everything - the menu changes a lot, but its always incredible., Great restaurant, great drinks, great food. Ambiance was just right and the service excellent. A tad pricey but worth it. A week later were still talking about some of the dishes we had. Would definitely go back! Soon!, Beautiful restaurant and ambiance. I took my best friend to this amazing restaurant and we both loved it. Food was outstanding., After an amazing dining experience at CityZen not long before Eric Ziebold left, I was very excited to dine at his new restaurant. Maybe my excitement resulted in my expectations becoming impossible to meet, because I left a little disappointed. The biggest issue I had was the service. The menu is uniquely designed; the concept is nice, but there was no indication as to how large each dish might be apart from the section titled For the Table which listed dishes obviously meant to be shared. After being seated and staring bemusedly at the menus for several minutes, my finac39 and I began to wonder where our waiter was. It was several more minutes before he finally came by to check in with us, take our drink orders, and explain the menu. We waited ten minutes at least.It was another long wait before we got our drinks. I had the Woolford from the cocktail menu (which I thought was a bit limited), which was unremarkable. My fianc39 wasn enthusiastic about anything on the cocktail menu and ordered a margarita; I can only say he had no complaints about it. After receiving our drinks, we ordered wine and our food. The food was good. But I didn come here for good food. I went to Kinship for an amazing and memorable dining experience, which I think is a reasonable expectation given the price point. I had the Takenoko Succotash as an appetizer, which was forgettable. I chose the lamb shoulder as my main course, which was delicious...but not THAT delicious. I can recall my fianc39 choice of appetizer but he ordered the rabbit for his main course. The rabbit is listed as a dish to be shared, but I can imagine anyone sharing a dish that small. Neither of us had eaten rabbit before, so we were curious. He devoured it and gave me a bite. I was pleased that I rather liked the taste since I had an impression that it would be very gamey, but other than that, I don have much to say.I do have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the Salted Caramel Peanut Bar for dessert, with the exception of the bourbon ice cream, but that just because I not a big fan of bourbon. There is nothing really wrong with Kinship although I think better service is a necessary improvement to make. But the thing I most strongly remember about it is leaving sort of disappointed, and thinking it definitely isn worth the price to go back., Friends and I pretty much had everything on the menu (except $50 beef). The only EXCEPTIONAL main course is the PAN SEARED RED FISH. Note that ALL the desserts suck (every one of them)., Interior is modern and classy. I was in love with the plates/cups/kitchenware. The service is top notch with multiple waiters willing to help with anything and they are very delicate and careful with their service. Small touches like refolding my napkin or making sure cutlery and silverware were placed delicately were nice details.Food:We had a pickled strawberry salad that was just ok. Salads are never really anything exciting though. At $14, it wasn the biggest ripoff but nothing special. As an appetizer, we ordered the lamb shoulder with couscous and the lobster french toast. Both were the highlights of the night. The lamb was incredibly tender and cooked perfectly. The lobster french toast was such a nice and creative dish.Our main course was the rabbit from the For the Table section. It was ok but nothing special. Presentation was very nice but it was not worth $60. For dessert we had the chocolate chip cookie dough souffle with the milk ice cream. So so good! Overall, some amazing dishes and some ok dishes that aren worth the price. Service and ambiance is 5-star., This place lives up to the hype. The star of the show is the lobster french toast, but everything else we ate was great as well. The mushroom torchon looks, tastes and feels like pate minus any minerally taste. If you picture Kinship as a replacement for CityZen, then the prices and portions are reasonable but otherwise its definitely pricey for the small portion sizes. The waiter said that the dishes are meant to be shared, but theyre so small (think tapas size for the appetizers) that youd only get 2 bites if you actually shared them. While the food is great and the service acceptable, Kinship is not a date spot. The plain walls and floors make the noise level way to high to hold a real conversation., Great food, good drinks and okay service. We arrived early and got a seat at a table in the bar to get a drink. 30 minutes later we still didnt have our drinks and had only just gotten the menu despite the wait staff passing by us several times. We still hadnt received our drinks when the manager came by to tell us our table wouldnt be ready because tables arent clearing as quickly as expected. Based on our experience, I doubt the delay was due to the diners and was more likely due to the service. We were given the option of continuing to wait or sitting at a booth in the bar. Since it was already 9:30 we decided to move to the booth. There, things picked up. The booths are super cute and cozy. The enclosed walls help to block out the noise. We finally got our drinks and placed our orders. The service was better once we were seated, but nothing like Cityzen. We started with the lobster french toast and the foie gras with duck scrapple. Both were delicious and highly recommended. We wavered on the entree as so many reviews here raved about the roast chicken, but we were thinking how good can a roast chicken be? We almost went with the lamb and the red fish but in the end decided to give the chicken a try. Seriously, this chicken is amazing. Theres this amazing lemon, garlic, brioche panade under the skin that is wonderfully tangy and flavorful. Even the white meat is juicy and tender. Its served with a salad and pan fried potatoes. All yummy. We finished with the chocolate chip cookie dough souffle with ice cream that was good and light (not caloric-wise but texture- and taste-wise). Oh and for those wondering how the menu works, the columns are separated into various categories like craft (focus on coming technique), ingredients (ficus in a specific product), etc., and within the column generally the first two are appetizers, second two are entr39es, and the last one is a dessert. For the table is for two or more and most come with the Parker house rolls which were good but tiny and not as great as I remembered from Cityzen. This wasnt a stellar restaurant experience, but it was enjoyable. I think/hope this is a restaurant that will improve with time to iron out some of the wrinkles. And valet parking is available for $10., Cyndys Bottom Line: Very pricey, nice ambiance, and an interesting menu.3.75 stars for food.We were lucky to acquire on street parking! However, Kinship does provide valet service.The space has a nice, relaxing ambiance, monochromatic white throughout, and a tranquil setting. There is a large bar area with booth seating as well. This is what we ate/drank:Fran37ois Diligent Brut, Champagne, France, NVCh32teau de Puligny-Montrachet, Clos-du-Ch32teau, Bourgogne, France, 2011*Caspian Sea Ossetra Caviar served with Yukon gold potato chips and creme fraiche. Loved the thin and crispiness of the chips. The creme fraiche complimented the caviar and the chips. I ran out of chips and they were so nice to bring more out to our table.*Maine Lobster French toast with rhubarb, cucumber and sesame mousse. An inventive dish with lobster. *Kinship Lemon Meringue pie with candied lemon rind. The pie was good but was expensive compared to the serving size., We spent a wonderful anniversary dinner at CityZen a few years ago, and were excited to do the same at Kinship this weekend. While the menu takes some getting used to (format) everything we had was excellent. The team really brought the CityZen service back. The waitstaff was wonderful and provided solid recommendations.The only negative was that the coffee could have been a bit stronger/better. Prices were reasonable for the quality of the food and service (~$200 for two people, including three apps, one entree to share, two glasses of wine, and dessert).Cant wait to go back!, The reviews about the bad service are legit. I expected so much more from an Eric Zeibold restaurant. The atmosphere is new and fresh, but the food is just OK (not worth the money) and the service was so bad that we asked to talk to a manager before we left. I go out to at least 3 restaurants a week, and I a foodie so I try to hit all the up-and-coming ones. I have not been this disappointed in a long time. Many times I asked our waitress questions about the menu, which is oddly organized to the point of confusion, and all three times she said what do you want to know? She said this in regards to my questions about the wine, about which vegetables to order and about the dessert menu. The vibe was very uninviting and cold. We were never offered bread until we asked, and even then the bread server turned away and served others before answering our question about whether or not we were supposed to get bread. Unfortunately, I would not suggest anyone to go here -- not even for the food, which wasn bad but nothing to write home about. We got the family style roasted chicken, which is well reviewed and worth it, the white mushroom (pate-like) for an appetizer, the bib lettuce salad, and the lobster french toast, which was good but super small.Kinship was a big disappointment to the point I felt like I needed to share., Amazeballs!!First, I would like to start with the decor; stark, white, modern, and clean. When you enter the restaurant, the immediate room on your left is my favorite part of the restaurant. It reminds me of a modernized library. I truly appreciate that Kinship has an actual sitting area unlike most restaurants, leaving you to hover over people eating and dining in the bar. My reservation was for 5:30 on a Wednesday and I was seated around 5:40. The only reason for the delay is that I was hoping to snag a booth in the bar, but the party showed up...dang! The booths are super cute and I would suggest that you put in a request because the booths in the bar and restaurant filled up before the tables.I concur with many of the reviewers in that the menu was a bit confusing, but when I asked my waiter Jonathan, he happily explained it to me. I think it would just be tons simpler if they just did like everybody else and labeled the menu with starters, main courses, and etc, but hey, Eric Ziebold is a James Beard nominee, so, he got this.For my meal, I went with the mushroom torch, the lobster french toast, and the salted caramel peanut bar. I liked the mushroom torch, but I LOVED the lobster french toast. The lobster french toast is typically an appetizer, but between the complimentary bread and butter, the torchon with the buttered brioche, and the french toast with the lobster, I was breaded out and wanted to save room for dessert, which brings me to my decision amongst so many delicious options.On initial glance, I was so for the chocolate chip souffle, but after thinking about it, its airy in the middle...so not really worth $24. Then the debate fell between the salted caramel bar and the whipped chocolate nougat. I wasnt really in the mood for so much chocolate, so the bar won and it was crazy good! Great choice!, Went here recently on a Friday night - it was pretty busy and the bar area was hopping. This is a reservations place, hard to walk in- you can score one on opentable pretty easily. Our booking was for 9pm. We entered and our table wasnt just ready so we were escorted to the pretty lounge area which is cozy but a bit on the cold side as the fireplace was off and the service was minimal. The hostess left a menu for cocktails which we would have happily ordered but no one followed up to actually take our drink order. Small annoyance but no biggie. After 10 min we were seated. Menu is a bit confusing with different categories and concepts - but everything we had was top notch. White asparagus was lovely, the lobster french toast was really quite special and the steak for two was excellent. We shared the lemon meringue pie which was great too - although the fig cookies with it didnt make much sense. Extensive wine list that reminds me of blue duck tavern. Service was good and friendly, the ambiance is nice, decor is minimal and pretty, although the lighting is a bit dark for my taste(dining room -romantic, bar- cool and mysterious and even the ladies room.- ok. I mean could you at least keep normal lights there? a dark washroom is like the start of an SVU episode). Price point: PRICEY. Its a fancy joint with fancy prices. Food is very good and well executed, but for the price its a special occasion type of place for me! Recommend., Great service, beautiful modern space that was very non-dc. Pricey food compared to pretty much every other restaurant weve been to. Food was good but not out of this world. Overall good experience. Went for a special occasion, not likely to return., Roast chicken was amazing. Fois gras was prepared perfectly and the pairing with the strawberries was delicious. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Couldnt have asked for a better dinner experience., Amazing!!! Gorgeous space, perfect service and incredible food. Such a hidden gem. Great for a special occasion., Amazing !!! The food is impeccable as is the service . There were plenty of choices from rabbit, sea food, meats and vegetables . The appetizers and the main course were both outstanding . Please save room for desert. It was phenomenal. There were four of us so we tasted everything . The drinks and wine selection were spot on. Kudos for having great mock tails . Why not 5 stars ? We had to wait over an hour for our table- not their fault- but this was barely acknowledged . Worst of all when we got the menu they told us the chicken would be 60-80min. Now we had 8pm reservations, sat down after 9:30 that would get us the chicken between 10:30-11:00 pm. Maybe they could have mentioned this while we sat down for drinks for 90+minutes ., To celebrate June anniversaries our best friends came down to Maryland and we spent a day in DC. After visiting a couple of museums we hoped to make an early reservation at Kinship. Because the tables were all booked we were informed the three booths in the bar area would be available first come first served. The restaurant is located on the same block as one of our most beloved dining spots, Rupperts. Kinship is located in a former furniture store and the buildout was done beautifully. We arrived a little before 5:30 and we were the first party seated except for someone sitting at the bar. The menu is arrange into categories relating to influences. We opted to go seasonal and had for starters two orders each of the morels and the soft crab. Both were exceptional. As an intermezzo and in celebration of the anniversaries we were given a champagne sorbet. We then had the duck breast, the halibut and the sweetbreads. They all were as wonderful as the starters. Perfectly prepared and delicious. We shared three desserts, the mango creme, the strawberries Romanoff and the chocolate nougat. Again each was particular and wonderful. The service was what you would expect from a first level restaurant: courteous and timely. If I had any criticism it would be in reference to the corkage fee. One thing I always have enjoyed about DC was the policy of not charging more than $25 per bottle till the restriction was lifted a few years ago. Most places have maintained that policy but a few of the high end restaurants have raised the corkage to $50. I think with the quality and cost of the food most diners would chose to bring wine which would compliment the meal and the high cost for corkage might discourage some diners from trying Kinship and it might make us think about returning., Clever menu. Fresh whole grain bread. Definitely a special-occasion place for my budget. Would like to come back with a large group. Five stars because of the food.More pros:The dining room is quiet enough to allow you to have a conversation with your dining partner. The seats are not crammed together. Minimalist, polished, well-though-out decor that takes advantage of the space, which is a former a furniture store.Thank you, backup waiter/busboy for not clearing my partner plate after he finished and I was still eating.Cons:Irritating waitress, e.g., And what are we having today? Lady, youe not dining with us.Responded to questions about dishes by rattling off the menu description. Yes, lady, I can read. And then the food runner repeated the menu descriptions while serving each and every dish. It would have been helpful if the waitress told me that the appetizer I ordered was the size of a main course, which was what I had asked about. So basically I ordered -- and had to eat, since I don waste food-- two main courses. Waitress rushed us with the check while we were trying to enjoy the last sips of our drinks, and after she realized that we were not ordering desert., My Review: dhrupadmary.wordpress.co206We recently had the good fortune of a memorable meal with friends at Kinship, the latest restaurant by visionary Chef Eric Ziebold in Washington, DC. Kinship is what I would call a concept restaurant which has a menu inspired by the single concept of kinship.Ziebold and Laurant define kinship with culinary items placed in one of four categories on the menu: Craft, History, Ingredients, and Indulgence. The organization of the menu around these four terms is as delightful for the diner as it is appealing to the academic social scientist in me.Each category includes 2-3 appetizers, main courses and dessert options from which diners can pick and choose. My dinner selection centered on crafty indulgence with a focus on ingredients for dessert. Highlights included morels served in a light mushroom sauce with poached egg and porcini as well as a splendid foie gras prepared to perfection with a sweet apple jam base (indulgence). As a main I opted for the duck confit (craft) which did not disappoint with its well-perfected texture-one of the best Ie had. The homemade bread and butter provided to the table also adds a nice touch.As a dessert our table opted for the salted caramel peanut bar-peanut, chocolate ganache and salted caramel with a scoop of bourbon ice cream-what more could one ask for-though dessert are on the smaller side compared to the typical DC restaurant and I would not recommend sharing. Other notes about the restaurant-the wine menu is extensive and they serve a variety of wonderful fruity reds with a large selection of Cabs and Pinots, which accompany most of the meal items well. They also have a well-rinsed slection of whites. This wine menu is among my favorite in DC, with Blue Duck Tavern being my absolute favorite. I also like that the Kinship menu provided the option of half bottles. I do not know if there is a sommelier on staff and it would have been nicer if one had stopped by. The waitstaff were professional but still appear to be getting their act together. A better trained and more well spoken set of waitstaff could really elevate this restaurant placing it among they top DC dining destinations.The ambiance is perfect mix of modernity integrated with concepts from the slow food movement-a minimalist heaven with a touch of home-like comforts, especially the set up at the bar. I felt like I was sitting inside of a Kinfolk magazine, a modern hipster delight. Kinship Rating (5 point scale)Food: 4.5Dessert: 4.5Ambiance: 5Service: 4, Went here for dinner this week and I was not impressed. The waitress was wonderful and the decor was amazing. The food was lack luster and overpriced. I ordered the lobster and it was chewy. I ordered the chocolate chip cookie dough souffl39, which was priced at 24 dollars, and I just at the ice cream because the souffl39 didnt taste good. The ice cream was served with some sort of crumble and that was awesome. I was really looking forward to Kinship because its hard to get a reservation, making me think it was way above standard. Ill stick to Roses Luxury., LOVED Kinship! Food was delish, service glorious and decor beautiful. This place lived up to the hype!, Came with friends Thu night on vacation. Menu options were excellent. Original chef from French Laundry. Each plate ingredient was described again when the plates came out. Adelshien half bottles. Morel mushrooms fricassee was excellent. Peking duck with cannolini roll was amazing. Cant go wrong with any of the desserts. First class service as expected., Came here on a Saturday evening to celebrate a birthday. Service was great, nice selection of wines and the food was outstanding. We had the falafel and mushroom torchon to start. The falafel and octopus was tender and light. The mushroom torchon was excellent, tasty and the brioche was wonderful and fluffy. For dinner we had the tuna and the pekin duck, again no complaints from either of us. The duck was great, nice variation of textures and the crepe duck confit was a nice side. For dessert we had the peanut butter bar, and the chocolate nougat. Again both outstanding. We will definitely come back!, All sauces were fabulous!Soused Pied de Cochon - 4/5 - perfectly cooked meat. Not in casing yet stayed together pretty well.Fricassee of Morel Mushrooms - 5/5 - best dish fiance has ever had in dc. PERFECT sauce, the one fried morel was a good touch. Somehow he made 6 or 7 strong flavors work together, thats not easy.Rabbit on Grits - 5/5 - another knockout dish. The way the rabbit was cooked shows he was trained in France. Another dynamite sauce. Love the okra.Pan Seared Redfish - 4/5 - a jambalaya dish. Could taste the flavors very well. Fish was a little overcooked. Would have given a four but the fish dropped it a notch.Service - 5/5 - one of the most knowledgeable waiters ever. That guy knew his shit man, he was a textbook. Fiance was talking so highly about the food so much that the waiter brought out chef to talk to us for a while! Raised in Iowa, trained in France.Would rate over 5 if we could, Worth the money! Its decor is a bit stuffy but the food speaks for itself. Will definitely come back!, Lovely, modern, luxe. Loved my experience here. Came here for a date with a girlfriend on a weeknight and loved everything. The decor, the food, the menu being unique (from left to right instead of top to bottom), and excellent service. The ambiance is terrific and the interior has a really gorgeous vintage meets modern tastefulness. Also loved the dessert I had (I think it had peanut butter in it)., This was a really wonderful place for a nice night out. The restaurant is not clearly marked on the door, but the valet stand has the name on it. We were seated promptly upon arrival. Reservations on the weekend are a must. Kinship is flexible in modifying food to accommodate gluten allergies. They even have gluten free bread! They did note that they cant do the roasted chicken gluten free but there were so many options that it didnt matter. The wine list was extensive and very well put together. The cocktail list is short, but looked great too. We got a bottle of wine and started with the wild mushroom torchon with beet salad/goat cheese and huckleberry gastrique. The torchon and beets were amazing although I felt he gastrique was missing something. It seemed more like decoration. For my main, I had the halibut dish. It was expertly cooked and perfectly seasoned. The asparagus/tarragon immersion fell flat though. It wasnt very flavorful. My husband had a rabbit dish that he enjoyed very much. For dessert, we shared a chocolate nougat, chocolate sorbet concoction with creme fraiche. It was heavenly. Service was attentive but not intrusive. Service was not rushed, which was greatly appreciated. I think the only disappointment was the sauces. Everything else was perfect!, Great place for a celebration meal. This is a fabulous new restaurant near the convention center. The interior was sleek, clean, modern and yet comfortable. You would never know that a major convention center was right across the street. There were some things that the service did very well. They wished me a happy birthday when I sat down. They pull the chair out for women when they arrive. They have a special plate that says kinship and happy birthday on it as a gratuity dessert. There were also a few missteps with the service. 1) They never explained the menu to us. The kinship menu is not super intuitive, especially given that the trend at restaurants like this is to have a tasting menu. Each of their categories looks like it could easily be a tasting menu of its own. 2) They were not great about refilling water. 3) At these price points, I prefer a tasting menu rather than seeing that I paying $23 for a souffle dessert. It was a good dessert, but I much rather see it as a course in a $125 tasting menu than as a stand alone.For reference, each of the categories (except for the large plates) has two appetizers, two entree size portions and a dessert. We ordered 3 appetizers, two entrees and two desserts. It was a good amount of food. Some of the stars were the peking duck and the cookie souffle. We also ordered the lamb, which was quite good, mushroom fricasse and the torchon of mushrooms. These two dishes were also very good. The salted caramel dessert was fine. Overall, it was an elegant experience, but there were just a few things missing to give it 5 stars., If only I could take the interior and place this in my home!!!! Stunning!!!! My parents and I got lucky and were able to be seated in the booth. Overall the service and food were great but you are certainly paying for it - wasnt really floored by any of the dishes (though the tongue was done nicely) but the ambiance was very lovely!, An up and coming superstar, Kinship exceeds all of your food expectations. The service is great. The room is crowded and loud, so not the best for intimate conversation. Unique dishes that you will only find here.
32|komi-washington|4.5 stars I loved Komi. I have been there a few times and will certainly return -- it was an extremely pleasant experience -- and the food is quite inventive, unique and definitely delicious. To start, they brought baked dates with marscapone, a little honey and olive oil and fleur de sel. I had 2 pasta dishes --- a greek-like gnocchi with corn, pine nuts and chanterelles and then parpadelle with milk roasted goat ragu. My dinner campanion had a big square of watermelon, topped with a slab of feta and arrugula as an appetizer and then also had the parpadelle --- we split fresh doughnuts with whipped chocolate marscapone for dessert. I use words like slab -- but that reflects on me -- not komi -- it is as refined as it is comforting.I went on the weekend for the 5 course pre fixe -- while it was a wonderful experience -- but tasting menus usually arent my favorite dining experience -- I almost prefer going during the week....One of my best DC dining experiences., Hands down one of the best meals Ive had in the DC Metro area. It helps that its a short hop, skip, and a jump from where I live. It was truly a dining experience full of great food, great service, and a simple but comfortable atmostphere in a renovated brownstone.I brought my parents here to celebrate their anniversary. We did the 5 course tasting menu: Small plates - My favorite of the bunch (and there were many) was a date stuffed with mascarpone cheese. There were a lot of other great plates like the cod roe and even the foie gras creme brulee was yum and I dont even like goose liver. Pasta dish - My parents and I tried a potoato truffle ravioli, a goat ragu papardelle, and a wild boar taglatelle. All were fantastic. My fav was the wild boar. Meat or Fish dish - My parents shared a salted fish with green beans and olives and I had braised goat over polenta with brussel sprouts and cooked apples. Both were amazing. The fish was so flavorful and the goat was just perfect. Cheese plate - This was a nice preface to the desset. Two small pieces of raisin bread, two different cheeses, and candied kumquats.  Dessert - We shared a chocolate grenache with olive oil ice cream (surprisingly good), pineapple panna cotta with mint, and lastly, their version of an apple pie. My fav was the pineapple although all were tasty.Its a price meal, dont get me wrong. But its well worth making a reservation a month in advance and paying the money for this. Trust me., I went to Komi for my 21st birthday dinner, summer of 2005. Yummmmmmmy. The restaurant is very sparse in its decor, no art on the walls as the food is supposed to be the art. Call me old fashioned, but I like something to look at while Im waiting for my food. In the end, the delicious meals trump the decor (or lack thereof in my opinion).I started with a great pasta dish- I cant remember exactly what it was but it was dyed with squid ink and absolutely fantastic. My main course was a kind of fish that I couldnt pronounce then and now dont remember, but it was the best fish I have ever eaten in my life. If youre squeamish, beware- they usually leave the head and tail on the fish. We had the doughnuts for dessert. Oh. my. god. They were amazing and now that Im writing this Im wondering who I can talk in to joining me for dessert at Komi this weekend. The reason that this place loses a star (really, a half of a star) is that they dont have a full bar. When I went, I think they only had beer and wine, which was a bit annoying. Their wine selection is stunning, but for groups that dont like wine or are preparing for a long night ahead of them (like a 21st birthday) itd be nice to offer some liquor., Komi is my current fave of the moment and has been since before its redo last winter.Jonny M and Anne have done a great job redoing the space even after removing a few tables. Peaceful and relaxing interior lets you savor every last bit of this amazing food. He house -cures his meats and olives-yum! Love the Tuna w/Speck and those DONUTS !!!!Spent our 2nd New Years Eve there and had an amazing 3+ hour meal. I tell everyone I meet to give this place a try., Many people have already reviewed this little gem, and I will echo that the 5-course pre-fixe dinner is the way to go. It is also very worth it to pay extra for the wine pairings. I think that nearly doubled our bill, but it was at least twice as fabulous to eat the food AND appreciate how the selected wine complemented it. There was plenty of alcohol provided, so you wont leave feeling like youve been cheated, either in quantity or quality., One of my top three favorite restaurants in DC. Note that this is a tough reservation to get because its a small place (and reservations are pretty much necessary) and now, at least on weekends, its tasting menu only. Chef-Owner Johnny Monis isnt just talented; hes ADORABLE.Favorites include mascarpone-filled dates sprinkled with sea salt, any lamb dish, watermelon with feta in summer, housemade crackers, those delicious Greek doughnuts and goat ragu over papardelle., If I could wish for my mother to have copulated with someone other than my father, I would have liked for her to time travel and go for Johnny Monis, chef at Komi, and one of my current culinary heroes. As an aspiring chef, he is a model for me as he is not only a great chef, but the first one Ive seen whos been able to make Greek food taste delicious. So its not really Greek food, I know, but damn, is it good. The mezzathaki alone are worth the price of five-course PRIX fixe menu. See my blog for an overly detailed description of my meal there., i visited Komi on a recent trip and it was absolutely delicious. Every dish, big or small, was tasty and nicely presented. There was so much food though, i thought my stomach was going to explode! Id go back there the next time Im in town., I cannot recall the last time a restaurant so far exceeded my expectations. Maybe the night my wife and I dined at Komi all the stars were aligned perfectly in the universe. But we walked away believing Johnny Monis just may be one of the best and underrated chefs in the country., There no shortage of fine dining restaurants in Washington, D.C. however they seem to spawn more from ostentation and from what expense account diners are willing to spend than from love of food or epicurean aspiration. I am continually disappointed at the many soulless dinners Ie eaten in the district - always hoping that this one or that will convince me that remarkable fine dining experiences are to be found here and that I just haven sussed them out yet.Considering that chef/owner Johnny Monis recently won Food & Wine Magazine annual Best New Chef award, I doubted we be able to get a table ringing the night of, but we did.I liked the casual vibe of Komi as soon as we entered. While nothing stunning architecturally or design-wise, I appreciated the unpretentious vibe of the place and seeing chef Monis himself cooking in the kitchen!Two set menus are offered, dinner at $78 which includes an extensive mezzethakia course followed by pasta, an entree and dessert and the degustazione for $150. While $78 is certainly not cheap, for what you get at Komi it an incredible value! Our meal began with house-cured California olives sprinkled with sea salt (youl notice chef Monisaffection of sea salt throughout the initial courses, as it gently sprinkled atop many of them). Olives are one of the few things I don like to eat. In fact, I might go so far as to say I kind of detest olives. Nonetheless, I popped the tiny green fruit into my mouth. The result was surprising. I may have even uttered, yum. There was none of the overpowering acridity I typically associate with olives. Instead there was the pure, clean taste I have come to link with fruity olive oil.Next tiny radishes topped with butter and roe arrived. I have a thing for radishes and butter, so I loved tossing this tiny gem into my mouth.A pristine slice of amberjack topped with a sprinkling of sea salt and chives came after the radishes. The freshness of the fish was critical to this dish. It something any sashimi-lover would be impressed with.Cauliflower and sea urchin puree with caviar arrived next, in a shot glass. The textural elements of the caviar made this a fun soup to slurp.Then a dish with a clear, cult-like following - warm dates stuffed with mascarpone and Greek yogurt and topped with sea salt - showed up. I can see why folks are so mad about this one. It INCREDIBLE. And I not even that crazy about dates! I order a dish of these if given the chance!Our server brought a plate with two grass green peppers and two tiny shots of gazpacho topped with micro basil. She suggested we eat the peppers first since one in ten is very spicy. Neither of us managed to get a fiery one. The gazpacho was a perfect treat on such a hot summer night.I wish I brought a camera that performs well in low-light to capture what came next. Perfectly cooked octopus plated with pig knuckles and lentils on top of which was an ethereally thin slice of avocado and a quail egg. This incredible plate marked our journey into the hot dishes.Next was a creamy fresh corn and ricotta kefte with a paprika saffron aioli. This was one tasty friend ball of heaven, let me tell you!The first of two tasty bites on a stick arrived just then. This one was steamed pita bread which encased an oxtail croquette. I began to wonder if things could get better.Then summer on a stick - in the form of watermelon with whipped feta, toasted hazelnuts and a sherry vinaigrette was placed before us. I love watermelon and feta! I said out loud.The watermelon concluded our mezzethakia course. Next we shared the pappardelle with milk-roasted baby goat ragu and the fava bean and mint ravioli. Thankfully these were small portions giving us the chance to taste these gorgeous pastas without filling up too much.We chose the Branzini for two for our main course. Our server brought the whole fish, encrusted in salt to the table for our inspection. Then she took back into the kitchen to have it deboned and plated for us alongside some wonderful local rapini.The fish was moist and perfectly seasoned so as not to overpower the taste of the fish itself.At the behest of many, we ordered the delicious Greek donuts for dessrt along with the strawberry shortcake. Komi is the restaurant Ie been wanting to find since moving to Washington, D.C. - a place where food is elevated to art but without being fussy or unfun. At Komi, I was served the meal I hoped for but did not get at Citronelle. The whimsy and creativity displayed by chef Johnny Monis is exceptional and even moreso when you consider he was not born until 1979 and opened Komi at just 24! The district is a better place because of Komi.NOTES:Plan for dinner at Komi! It a lengthy meal - bet on around three hours - so bring someone you really enjoy talking with.Bring a camera that performs well in low light, youl want to take pictures of this food., Went here on a date last week, and I have tried quite a few places in Dupont C, but this was a pleasant surprise. The med spin on classic steak was definitely unique.I would go back to try a few more selections.HW, I had the best olive I have ever had in my entire life at Komi.I am actually content knowing I will probably not eat another olive so divine, tender, sweet and luscious in my life ever again. Hats off to the host and hostess. When I first called to make a res they were very nice and asked if this was a special occasion. Indeed it was! My cousin/best friend was leaving DC and I wanted to send her off having with a most fabulous dining experience on the brain. It is safe to say I succeeded!Wine list: great! We wanted to start with bubbly and asked if we should go for the greek or italian. We were told the Greek sparkling was good, and since we have never had sparkling from Greece before we got a bottle....yum!A couple stand out items: the octopus with quail egg....oh my goodness!The Gazpacho made with grapes?!?!?! With a side of these grilled peppers that were grilled to perfection....pure lovlieness.For our entrees we got the steak and the sturgeon. Neither of us had ever had any sort of beef steak that had so much flavor ever before in our entire lives. Wow, so amazing.And there we are snapping pics of almost every dish, which inspired the waitress to ask why? I told her my cuz was leaving town. This was around the time of dessert. After bring out a bottle of a Greek red wine we ordered (also very yum) the server brought us a dish, a gift from the pastry chef with the words good luck written on it in chocolate sauce and a sweet cream gelati in two spoons! How sweet of them!The wine list is great because you can get reasonably priced bottles and glasses (like we did) or move to higher end items and not feel strange either way.The restaurant was more casual than we had expected. I love the simplicity and homey-ness of it all.Save up your dough and try this restaurant. It is about time the does DC have its own amazing cuisine? debate is laid to rest. This restaurant proves it is so.Truly inspiring food!, So my fellow foodie and friend, the fashonista femme fatale Jess and I headed here for food, fun, and fabulous fare...So I called ahead and told them I was a vegetarian and they were not only accommodating, Jess said next time shed go with the vegetarian options as well since she liked them better. Oh yes the olives...oh hell yes. But the winner tonight...ding ding:The grape gazpacho with microherbs and stuffed peppers. WTF mate? This dish was so complex it was hard to get my brain around it. The mascarpone stuffed medjool dates were a close second. I loved the agnolotti and the quail egg, avocado and lentil dish as well. As an entree, I had a trio of candy striped beets, apple, faro and cream, a soft polenta, grilled romaine and roasted garlic, and white beans, green olive, and poached egg. It was fantastic!The desserts were yuzu cream with huckleberries and doughnuts with chocolate mousse. Both were great.The service was fantastic. We loved our server and the sommelier. The downside: Jess entree was mediocre. She ordered the morcilla and foie gras stuffed guinea hen. In a uncharacteristic display of discontinuity, the hen was accompanied by a small square of moussaka that was fantastic and a wonderful, but greasy fried pig feet ball. Why? What did these have to do with the center of the plate. They did not complement or contrast with the main dish and washed out the hen. The hen was heavy, underseasoned and quite boring frankly. Maybe it was because everything else was so good that it was hard to live up to the high standard set by the opening dishes. As well, the heirloom tomato risotto with idizibal cheese foam was the only other dish to disappoint. Again, it wasnt bad, just not up to the standard of the rest of the meal.I suppose if you have 14 courses and 2 are less than stellar thats pretty good. It was just disappointing that it was the two Jess chose. Overall it was fantastic and I would certainly return., Everything about this dining experience is perfect. But go with a lot of money in your pocket -- and a lot of time on your hands.First of all, the thing I didn really understand from the reviewers here is that Komi gives you only two dining options.You can choose an $85 option with a series of their signature small plates (like about eight of them!), a pasta, an entree and a dessert. Wine pairings for this are $35, I think, for three glasses.OR, you can choose a more expensive option, about $105 (?), where you get more small plates but the chef selects the rest of the food for you. Wine pairings are a bit more expensive but you get five glasses.Everyone at your table has to agree on which option to do, or else it would screw up the timing of the meal.Also, for the entrees, many of them are listed as for two and those carry an extra cost. But it worth it for the quality of the ingredients and the experience -- such as a whole fish brought to your table, oh the drama!When three of us dined there last week, we opted for the $85 option because we wanted to have some control over what we ate.Everything was great. The service was impeccable, the somalier was excellent and the atmosphere was just right. I would go back again and again, although I have the feeling many of the small plates would be the same from night to night.I would also suggest getting the wine pairings. All the selections were excellent. The orange lollypop at the end of the meal is also a nice, surprising touch., Komi is one of the most unique dining experiences you will ever have. The dining area is intimate...they dont even allow groups larger then 5 or 6 people, reservations are a must. The menu is pricey- but it is well worth it. You pretty much spend all evening eating (7 or 8 courses if you like) The chef prepares two menu options and two pasta options. The food is like a heavenly explosion in your mouth. The wait staff is incredibly knowledgeable of the food and background behind each course. The chef/owner has a unique food point of view. The pastry chef is a friend of mine and he is well amazing. He does a concord grape sorbet with little peanut butter cookie things. The perfect ending to a perfect meal., The meal I had at Komi, yea though it was quite a while ago, stands out in my mind like it was yesterday. Our very evangelistic server brought us closer to Jesus with each course. Amazing meal, from the homemade crackers to the lollipops that come with the check. I actually recreated the amuse bouche they served me at Komi for a dinner party to rave reviews... it was a simple recipe, I just never would have THOUGHT of it. I guess thats why Johnny is where he is!, I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. Its always written up in Food & Wine and I couldnt wait. They definitely met my expectations. My bf and I had our anniversary here last night and went for the full deal. We got the 5 glasses of wine with the full spread of food.The experience was awesome. The restaurant is gorgeous. I loved all the different plates that were brought out. The only 3 I wasnt a fan of involved caviar/roe/foie gras. No matter how many times I taste these delicacies, I dont like them.Other than that my mouth was treated to amazing wines and amazing flavors.The rioja really stood out. The lobster with hearts of palm was one of the tastiest bites Ive ever had. The mini gyro, hamachi and the tagliatelle were incredible. Finally, the goat shoulder was unbelievably tasty.I cant afford this place often as a student, but I have to say it was worth every penny ($231/person w/ tip for the real deal)., This place is soooooooooooo bad. I have eaten at experimental cuisine places all over the country, and only one has missed the mark as completely as Komi does. There was simply no guiding culinary intelligence behind the dishes that they cooked up. Dates stuffed with cheese were good, but standard; anything off the beaten track was misguided. The atmosphere and service were also very mediocre for a place this expensive. There is simply no basis for the prices., YUMM!! I love this place! The series of small dishes you get are like an adventure for your taste buds. I get excited trying to figure out what Ill get next! I can honestly say that the hot dates with mascarpone and sea salt is one of the best things Ive ever had in DC...its both sweet and salty, and plays with different textures...amazing! The main dishes you get however, are just ok-- theyre good, but nothing spectacular. If I could, Id trade them in for more small plates!, I treated my best friend from high school here because thats the kind of cool friend I am. Ok, I admit--supposedly, in return, someday she is supposed to treat me to some spa weekend when we are in our 50s since she will be making triple my salary (I hope she remembers this agreement)...This place was absolutely fantastic! Although the decor is a little sterile, the tasting menu coupled with matching wines was probably one of my top 10 dining experiences in life so far...yum., Komi! This is one of my favorite restaurants in town. The food is really creative and delicious, the service is wonderfully attentive and the space is very intimate and relaxing. When you visit, youll most likely taste dishes whose ingredients you wouldnt have thought to combine but make so much sense they way Monis presents them. The sampling dishes change all the time and are really impressive and memorable - and for the main course, the pappardelle with baby goat ragu and the suckling pig are divine. Its a low-pressure, high-quality dining experience that youll want to repeat., I really liked my meal here, and we truly appreciated the level of effort and refinement in each dish. It was all very good - but just not a 5 star best in its class. If you have the budget and are in DC wanting a top dining experience, check it out. If spending $500 on dinner for two (with wine) is an epic splurge. I think, though, that one could dine somewhere else for the same quality and spend a lot less (with fewer dishes, of course). Im not knocking this place, but having dined around the world, I just cant get as excited as those 5 star reviews here., Komi was amazing!!!! When my friend first suggested that we go here for my birthday dinner, I was excited but didnt know what the price would be, nor what the food would be like. As soon as I saw the menu and the price ($90) I felt burdened and suggested that it would be okay to go somewhere else, but we stayed due to my friends insistence and as soon as I had the first bite my worries were at rest. I felt like I never truly knew what good food tasted like until that evening. All of the different flavor, textures~ the portions were small but that was what kept you wanting more, excited to try what would be served next. The restaurant atmosphere, with its bare walls, and attentive staff, was not pretentious in the least bit. Though dinner took two and a half hours, when walking out of the restaurant, it felt as if I had just seen a performance, as opposed to have just had dinner. Though not an everyday thing,, it was most definitely worth the experience=), Freaking awesome and delicious and magical., Holy shit. Took the boyfriend here for his birthday dinner last Saturday... it was nothing short of amazing. Weve both found our new favorite restaurant and cant wait to come back again. We both did the degustazione menu and couldnt have been more pleased. 13 courses in total. Love love love the atmosphere inside, and I adored the style of service, which was more family style and encouraged us to share and interact. Komi absolutely blew every other fine dining experience out of the water, and for a smaller price tag. Its worth every penny. My only complaint was that I felt the wine list a little sparse., My buddy called for reservation, they said NO. And then we walked in and they said,We need reservation. uhmm... What wrong with the picture? It is because we wore jeans and T-shirt. I will find a better place to eat., Seriously.I mean, really.This will be a long review as there is no other way to get across to you people how much Komi deserves 5 stars.Hands down, the best meal Ive ever had. Not that you havent heard that before while reading about Komi. I mean, it was so amazing, I think I may travel back here, from wherever I am, just to celebrate my 40th here with some REALLY close friends. Some highlights:*Impeccable service - even though my girlfriend and I showed up in jeans and nice shirts (you know, not slobbish, but not uber dressed up), we were treated just as well as any other patron that night, and maybe even better. I think the servers enjoyed how much we enjoyed the food. They were all very knowledgeable and thoughtful, and everyone took responsibility for us, not just our designated server. We were initially sat at a table in the middle of the room, closest to the kitchen, but as soon as another, more cozy, intimate table opened up, they offered it to us without us even asking.*The Mezzethalia (spelling?) is basically 9-11 mini-appetizers. Each one was made with something Ive never heard of or thought of actually eating, but each one was heaven. All of the dishes were perfectly delicate, but carried all the flavor you could dream of, complete with seasonings/sauces that teased out the base flavors and complemented them, without overpowering the main component.*The pasta. It took me about 40 minutes to eat the Tagliatelle with milk roasted duck ragu because I just didnt want it to end. The wine they paired with the pasta was a Greek red (I wish I could remember what it was!) and they danced their way across my tongue on their way to my very happy stomach. My girlfriend had the Boulettas of arrowleaf spinach w/ brown butter and black truffle, and it was equally unique and unforgettable.For our main dish, we shared the suckling pig, just because it was something I would never order anywhere else, and while Im sure someone who enjoys little baby pig would die for this dish, I liked it okay. But I have to give Komi the benefit of the doubt on this one, since I was trying something I wasnt sure I would like anyhow. My girlfriend thought it was really good.So, yes, its hard to get a reservation, and yes, its expensive, but Id do it all again, in a heartbeat because its SO worth it., This is probably one of the best restaurants in DC, if not the best. The food was absolutely fantastic, and they completely customized my meal to fit my dietary restrictions. They had a vegetarian tasting, but I ended up having their three course meal with small plates. The small plates were the best part because it was like 40 minutes of surprise dishes.. I think about eight of them total at the end. The small dishes ranged from this mushroom ricotta mixture to a pickle corn dog, an abalone mushroom mini sandwich and a whole bunch of other dishes. Anyways, every single dish was amazing and creative... the only thing is.. its VERY expensive. This is definitely a special occassion kind of place, and the minimum amount you can pay is $90/person, and thats with nothing extra to drink. Totally worth it for being in DC, but you really have to be ready to drop some big money. Compared to the other overpriced restaurants in DC though, its by far the best and most worth it., The best meal Ive had in DC hand down. I was so impressed. This is definitely a special occasion kind of place, but worth it even if you can only afford it once a year., Oh wow. This was dope.Service was top notch. Food (tasting menu) was unlike anything else I have had. The atmosphere was warm and casual, yet there was no doubt that it was about some fine eating. We got the wine pairings, and they even wrote down all the wines for us because we liked them so much. All of the food was oh so good, particularly the seafood. I have never had seafood that melted in my mouth the way this stuff did, particularly the diver scallops with black truffles. This place is way pricey, and I doubt we will be returning too soon, but if you are looking to celebrate a special occasion with someone who loves food and appreciates creativity and presentation, this is it., Im only adding to the heap of praise. I love this place! Its expensive, but really really amazing. The food is fun and exciting, and I really dont know which dish I should rave about first, so Im just going to say save your pennies and go yourself., K - Kreative ... ok, I know it starts with a C.O - for Obama, since we were celebrating his inauguration M - MM Good, Muy Bueno, Molto BeneI - Inventive, delicious small dishesGreat restaurant in the Dupont Circle neighborhood. Totally unassuming building that houses a hidden neighborhood gem, watch out for the lollipops at the end of dinner, they might pull out a filling. French Laundry, move over, this resto is a much better value., yum, my new favorite special occasion place. I lived nearby for years, and it wasnt until I started reading foodie posts that I even heard of Komi. Even then I had to double check the address to find it, and low and behold it had been in front of me all along!I got my husband a gift certificate (which was an interesting experience, I dont think they do many of these, I had to stand awkwardly in the dining room while everyone stared, but thats ok) and we finally used it on our anniversary. We like to treat ourselves to at least one epic meal a year, usually while on vacation. This meal made me feel like we were back in Italy on our honeymoon. Not that what we got was Italian, just the experience. The focus is definitely on the food here. Which I love because it doesnt seem as pretentious an atmosphere as some other highly rated DC establishments. Im no food critic, I just know we had a great meal. Yes, its expensive. Im glad we split it across two gifting occasions, but we were there for 3 hours and even got a complimentary glass of champagne because they had to change our reservation. Excellent service, charming atmosphere, and great experience., I have to be short. We had the tasting menu. Wine list was tight and good. The small plates were amazing. No one at the table thought the pastas were good (we had two types). Bland all around. For the Main, the goat was great, but the fish was nothing special. Desserts were like the Pasta. Kind of bland. But the small plates...Worth the trip. Service was great. Friendly and casual, but very professional. It was expensive and we would all go back, just not very often., Seriously the best dining experience Ive had in the DC metro area. Hard on the wallet but so very soothing to the palette~ Fortunately, I was lucky enough to enjoy this experience for FREE (because a friend treated me out)! =) I am still craving the marscapone stuffed dates and the olives!!! I never knew olives could give me such pleasure... You must try it once just for the experience. I await the day I return..., Delicious. Great cozy space. Expensive. The best mediterranean food Ive had on the East Coast. I dont even really like mediterranean food. Great tasting menu, great wine, would return., One word to describe the food at Komi: orgasmic.When you leave, you are not stuffed, nor are you hungry. You feel a bit tipsy, but its not due to the drink. The food is like nothing Ive had before. The price is quite expensive, but its worth every penny. Save this spot for a special occasion., ok.. seriously rock star dining! best meal you might EVER have..but I left and still was hungry!! NOT GOOD! everything was perfect.. and I mean everything.. its no wonder they were #1 did I mention I was still hungry?? o and for my wife and I after tip was 500 bucks.. I was still hungry! damn it! if not for that 1 little part we would go back next month.. but I can do a big mac and get full.. But honestly if you want a special night.. this is the place !!, Best Restaurant in the City and beyond. It not often when a meal changes my life but I can honestly say that every time I go to Komi(once or twice a year) I walk away with a new perspective on food. Johnny Monis(the Chef/owner) understands flavor combinations in a way that few other chefs ever acheive and he under thirty. Ie ben to all the other 5 star restaurants in the area and whenever I going to go out and blow a bunch of money on a meal this is my choice., I stumbled upon Komi in October of 2008 and it was the best meal of my life!!!!!!! I cant overstate how good this place is. Johnny Monis is a genius in the Kitchen. He is certainly on par with any of the greatest chefs in the country., A meal at Komi is hands down the best meal and experience in the area. Both times Ive eaten here the food was unmatched, the service was on point, and the overall experience was unforgettable. Highly recommended and in my opinion, no one else even comes close., I should have taken notes on the amazing Mezzethakia (9 course tasting menu) we had here, but I enjoyed my 2 hour meal so much I didnt want to make a chore out of it. The 3 glass wine pairing made me forget most of the details, but I still remember the tastes so vividly.Never knew Greek cuisine could be so stimulating to the palate. Johnny Monis is a true culinary magician. I hate that hes younger than we are, but he does put out an unusual and inventive menu. It will probably change by the time I post this. - Beef cheek stuffed pasta with anchovies and preserved lemon (4 stars)- Eggplant and wild onions stuffed pasta with snails & basil (5 stars)- Spaghetti with Catalina sea urchin (4.5 stars) - Raviolini of salt roasted pumpkin with maple and pine nut (5 stars)- Olive oil roasted skate with almond puree and radishes (5 stars)- Charcoal grilled beef with turnips and bacon (5 stars)- Roasted suckling pig (4.75 stars)I cant remember the last 2 dishes, but I do know I loved the taste of them. Every dish had all the right combinations. This place deserves all my 5 stars!, This is by far one of my Favorite Spots. I love the intimate feelings. They know how to make you feel comfortable and welcomed and service is outstanding. The young Chef has managed to put together a unique and sophisticated menu!!! THIS PLACE IS UNCOMPARABLE to any other! LOVE IT!, What a gem! This is by far, my favorite restaurant in the city. It surpasses Citronelle, CityZen, and other highly acclaimed restaurants in the city by far. Its just unfornate that its so hard to secure reservations at the last minute. I love showing off this restaurant to last minute out of town guests to showcase what DC has to offer., Not much to say about Komi that hasn already been said. This place is awesome. I can give it the superlative of Best in DC since I haven been everywhere, but I have to think it way up there. Made the reservation exactly one month in advance for my girlfriend birthday, and had to anxiously wait 30 days for it to come so I could experience what several friends have raved about. I called Komi a few days before and asked if I could drop off flowers and a card and have it waiting for us, and they were happy to help. When we arrived for our 7:30pm Friday reservation, we were led to a perfect table in the back corner by the kitchen, where the flowers and card had already taken their place.For our meals, we gave complete control to the chef, which turned out to be a great decision. Ie never been an overly adventurous eater, but have enjoyed expanding my palette in recent years with flavors and textures, and Komi certainly catered to this. I can recall everything (we must have been served at least 15 small dishes to start, plus a few after dinner), but some of the highlights included the mascarpone-stuffed date, the cheese plate with eucalyptus honey, trout roe on house-baked brioche with creme fraiche, and, of course, the katsikaki (goat). It was delicious and generously portioned. The 5 condiments were all fantastic and exploded with flavor. The one thing that I was not overly impressed with was the signature caesar salad in a bite. While it was neat, the warmness of it and liquid center reminded me of rotted lettuce. Wasn terrible, I just wasn feeling it as much as the others.We also had the 5-wine pairing, and the sommelier, Kathryn, was great. Same goes for all of the servers. They shared in the delivery of the plates and were so coordinated and crisp in their descriptions (as should be expected at a place like Komi). We also received at least 4 compliments on the flowers I had brought in (which made me look good in front of my girlfriend but was all Nosegay Flower Shop doing).Another cool thing they did for us was write down all of the wines and a summary of the tasting menu (though they didn include everything or a full description of the plate, which would have been nice, since there were so many and the wine made it difficult to remember everything).Overall a superb experience and where I will go at least twice a year to continue expanding my palette and spend lots of money!, Um... can we say, best meal ever? My husband took me here for my birthday, and I couldn have been happier. The ambience was simple and elegant, the service was friendly and attentive, and the food... ahh, the food... while I will echo other posterscomments about the marscarpone date and the Caesar salad in the crouton, I must say that the highlights of the meal were the sashimi and the hazelnut scallop -- both melted in my mouth. If Yelp had a bonus-star system, Komi would get a sixth from me!, It pains me to write this...#1 Best meal Ie ever had? No#2 Was it worth $125 for the Degustazione? No#3 Best Restaurant in DC? Maybe#4 Would you go back? Probably not.Harsh. Rude. Unbelievable. But its the truth my friends.I won go into details of how dinner works at Komi, as the numerous other excellent posts have detailed it sufficiently. So here my review of the dinner...The Mezzethakia started off with several dishes of raw fish: amberjack, hamashi, etc. The problem here is Ie had some good sashima at some of the best restaurants in the country. There no way Komi, is going to beat the quality of the fish at a place like Sasubune Honolulu or Sushi Yasuda. Or even across the street at Sushi Taro! Plus the pieces of fish came with herbs like chives. It like putting steak sauce on a cut of dry-aged porterhouse. So attempting to be the best by serving cuts of sashimi is just a hopeless task. And Salmon Tartare while a bit uncommon again doesn amaze me. The brioche filled with Foie Gras Mousse and trout roe tasted excellently, but was a minor highlight in a chorus of average-ness.Flank steak tartate - ok.Then came the main courses.Spaghetti with Catalina Uni was good, but I had a similar dish at Basta Pasta in NYC. My pasta was cooked a bit too long, I would suggest it be serve more al dente.Now by this point we were getting full. The best dish was a perfectly roasted suckling pig and goat. It was served with home made pita bread. Also came with a selection of condiments such as sea salt, tsaziki sauce, and red chili sauce. I loved this course and would go back to the restaurant if I could just have it. This is probably Chef Monis closest success at a signature dish.The service was outstanding and flawless. The waiters and waitresses were incredibly professional and friendly, but what would you expect otherwise in a restaurant of this level?It disappointing to write this review as Ie heard so much about this place. But like many things in life, it didn live up to the hype. Again I think trying to beat the best in the country with raw fish, be sashimi or ceviche, is an impossible task. The cooked dishes were inventive, but not completely original and if your a foodie you probably won be completely surprised by it. For that, molecular gastronomy places like Mini-bar would be more successful. So in the above $120 tasting menu class, this is A-OK. It probably some of the best food in DC, but it not ready for the world stage yet., Ok - I have to upgrade this to a 5 star. I made my way back to Komi because I lost a bet and had to pay up. So glad I did and the only way to go there is to do the Chef tasting menu. Worlds of a different experience from just ordering the normal way.This time we had the Chef tasting menu. I don want to ruin this dining experience by listing out all of the amazing dishes that were brought to us because the element of surprise before each dish came was part of the experience. I will say that almost all of our dishes were creative fish dishes, with one meat dishes and they came together so perfectly like a story being told with each dish brought out. I have to say, this tasting menu exceeded Minibar tasting menu.The bill was super expensive and I flinched to think it felt like a REALLY nice car payment. ($125/person plus whatever you drink that really racks your bill up)If youe a foodie, save up for this. Don look at the menu. Don read another spoiler review. Just go in blind and do the chef tasting menu., Komi the second time around was an even more decadently delicious experience. This time we went ahead with the chefs tasting menu and we were not disappointed. We made a special request (no blue cheese...it is one of the very few items that I cannot consume) and the restaurant was especially accommodating. The list of foods that we had goes on and on. The highlight, surprisingly, was the spit roasted kasitaki. Typically, I am not a huge fan of goat or lamb but this was cooked to perfection. The outside was crunchy and the inside was so juicy that it literally melted in your mouth. The regular menu is amazing but this is over the top and well-worth it. Your stomach will thank you!, go here, get the degustazione with 5 glass pairings, let them do whatever they want to you. i know every girl wants to get with monis after eating here...but really....i am ready to forego all other men for him. does he read this stuff?, Best restaurant in Washington DC., My husband and I celebrated the end of law school at KOMI about two weeks ago. We shared the dinner with two good friends. Our experience was so good that I would rate it as one of our two or three best dinners ever.We all chose the degustation menu, and my husband chose the five wine pairings, the rest of us ordered a bottle of white to start (a greek wine - cant remember the name but it was delicious, crisp, balanced and cheap!) and a red later in the night.Dinner starts with beautiful and inventive little plates called Mezzethakia, my favorite part of the dinner. I cant recall everything but we had mini brioche with caviar, foie gras burger, fresh raw scallop in a light ceviche, amberjack crudo, house-made crackers, oven roasted date stuffed with mascarpone, etc. I could go on! The plates were served with just a short intermission between each, with tasting notes where appropriate from the server. For dinner, we were served the fava bean ravioli and a tagliatelle with various spring mushrooms and vegetables. The pastas were light and flavorful, left me wanting more.Second course was Katsikaki and Suckling Pig. This was the highlight of the meal. Crispy, salty, slow-roasted pig skin and the most tender pieces of pork youve ever imagined. And the katsikaki (goat) was also a tender, juicy delicious hunk of meat that the entire table shared, devouring the meat with pieces of fluffy house-made pita bread and delicious spreads and tapenades that were placed before us.Dessert was a small succession of cakes and ice creams that led us towards delicious oblivion. At the end of the night when we got our check we were so full and happy we barely noticed the sudden lightness of our wallets. Definitely expensive but worth of many future celebratory trips. I think in the future I would just go for the dinner, and select exactly which pasta Im getting (I was a bit disappointed to not get to try the famous uni pasta!!) Otherwise we were absolutely thrilled, as you will be., 4.75 stars -- a great place for a special occasion or gatheringIt appears that folks either adore or despise Komi; based on my late-August dining experience, I will add my voice to those submitting glowing reviews. For years, I stroll down 17th Street, note Komi (rave reviews popping into my head), think At some point, I need to try that place, and never get around to it. With autumn on the horizon, two of my girlfriends decided that the time had come for a dining pilgrimage; we secured reservations a few weeks in advance and met on a weekday evening, prepared to catch up and enjoy a girls night, foodie style at this much-raved-about establishment.We found the converted townhouse space comfortable, with a relaxed vibe and a pleasant noise level that allowed us to carry on conversations sans ear strain. We decided upon the pre-fixe dinner with wine pairings and--much to my relief--the server assured me that my non-meat-eating status could be easily accommodated; dishes would be tailored to incorporate seafood and veggies instead. Marvelous! Over the course of a few hours, we enjoyed a creative, scrumptious meal filled with a variety of flavors and attractive twists. The meal pace was optimal, with each course seamlessly flowing into the next. Admittedly--and I know this is cringe-inducing to the foodies--I a buffet type of girl who likes to try a little of everything; for me, Komi offered an ideal opportunity to savor a delightful assortment of well-prepared tastes. Occasionally, I felt that we were bothering our server(s) and that was the only area that I would not award 5 stars (hence the 4.75 star--a small deduction; a bobble, not a complete topple off the balance beam). Thank you to my delightful friend with the photographic memory, here is a recollection of our meal...Mezzethakia* lime granita with honeydew and green tomato soup* a trio of raw fish (one with olive oil and fleur de sel, another pickled, another with a soy reduction)* thinly sliced diver scallop with mustard* spoons of diced scallop with lobster sauce and pickled beet* oven roasted dates stuffed with mascarpone* fried caeser salad bites* coronets of beef tar tare topped with quail egg and parmesean foam* housemade pita with abalone mushroom* foie gras cream puff and goat cheese smore, plus pepper geleePasta* tagliatelli with local blueberries and sausage (?)* spaghetti with diced sea urchin in a sea urchin puree* mint ravioliEntree* whole roasted skate* roasted suckling pig with five toppings (a blueberry moutarde, fleur de sel, eggplant with mint, habanero, and pickled cabbageDessert* Greek doughnuts with walnut mousse* Peach crisp on sweet tomato coulis* Chocolate mousse atop grilled pineapple and spearmint coulisLemon thyme lollipops to go., One of the best meals of my life, and an intimate, enjoyable dining experience on our fifth anniversary. We got the supplementary entree (roast baby goat, but apparently this changes by season and availability), and you should too if you eat meat. If you like wine, get the five-glass pairing option; their wine-pairing is truly sublime. Service cant be overlooked, as it was spot-on the entire time. This is probably the only place where I would say, if you can afford it, go for your next special occasion., Not too much new to post. This place kicks ass. Did the degustazione menu where Johnny makes all the choice for you. Paired it with the 3 glass wine offering (ended up augmenting with another glass as well). I am going to slack on the structure of this review and go to bullets:logistics- call 2 weeks or more in advance if you want a specific date/time- they dont seat parties of more than 4- be prepared for a 3 hour pr longer meal, dont bring the in-laws or someone else you dont want to spend time withfood- the Mezzethakia seemed to go on forever and was fantastic. literally it took over an hour to get through this course. Each of these small (one or two bite) courses really showed off the complemenatry flavors and textures of the food. My favorite was one of the fish he served early - I dont remember what it was as theere were so many. It was so good I can still almost taste it now and I went over a week ago.- one complaint. when we were going over the menu the server talked up the Katsikaki and we all were very interested. She said this was part of the degustazione menu so we all chose that option. We were then served Slow Roasted Suckling Pig - which was good and a similar option - but not what we had prepared ourselves for. Just a minor disapointment.Wine- the wines were all fantastic. I found my new favorite white. I wont post what it is here until I find a local distributor. I have been buying everyone out of it over the internet and it seems no one carries more than a case. My recommendation is to go with the pairings though. There are many great wines on their list, but they will serve you some excellent glasses that you may have not tried before.Service- fantastic, extremely attentive- never had to move as the bus staff did gymanstics to get to finished plates without touching me or any other guest nor spilling or dropping anything.- waitress was great apart from the screw up with the main course I noted above.-sommelier was fantastic. I loved the pairings they offered and would definitely look to them for advice.Bottom line, definitely one of the top three restaurants in DC. If you have the $s to burn it should be on the top of your list..., I haven Yelped in about a year, but I felt the need to give Komi five stars to counteract the jackasses giving it one star because it was too expensive or the service was slow all the while saying the food was very tasty.I mean, you make reservations at this restaurant understanding that it a 2+ hour experience and that it going to cost you some benjamins. Sit down, relax, enjoy the effing delicious food, and eat ramen for a couple of weeks afterward. It worth it.Komi full chef tasting menu is the best meal Ie had in Washington. It may be second only to Ko in NY for best meal of life. I am a snobby snobby foodie and Komi impressed me. The mezzo flavors were delicate and creative, the pasta courses were on par, and the goat shoulder blew my mind.Save up and eat here. Don listen to the haters., Quite frankly I just dont get it. Im sorry, but I agree with Jeff G in that Komi is overrated. The service is painfully slow. Just because the food is decent doesnt mean service should be lacking. An example would be my request for water was not addressed for 20 minutes. And speaking of the food, it is way over priced for what it is. I gave it the 2nd star because the food was decent. Everything else about the place is lacking in my humble opinion., So I had to let my dining experience digest (har, har) before writing about Komi. The reviews really do make any diner feel like they have to pick a side: love or hate. Its a tough choice when you do recognize that the price is quite high, and the food is quite good, but that that latter isn necessarily a direct result of the former. Ie been to Komi twice now - both times electing to have the chef tasting menu, and both times very pleased, but the price-point clearly makes careful judgment a necessity. So like a child in divorce court, I sat down and thought long and hard about which parent I wanted to live with: good or bad. Ultimately 3 factors influenced my decision to go with 4 stars:Its not just dinner, its an experience.Cheesy, I know, but when the waiter comes and explains to you whats on your plate, and you put on your tongue flavor combinations that you could have never in your wildest dreamed up (unless you are a molecular gastronimist or something), its a very cool thing. I don know, maybe I just a rube, but I really like that aspect of the experience and I feel like it widens my perspective on how simple ingredients can be taken to the next level in effortless, but unusual, ways.Its like food art.Where else are you going to find an inside-out (crouton on the outside) caesar salad that you eat with your hands? Ok, ok, maybe in the midwest at some county fair where the lettuce is really a snickers bar and the crouton is really a deep-fried, batter shell. I didn even particularly love this dish because I thought the dressing was a bit strong, but its a cool idea. AND its a reminder that the chef in the kitchen has been slaving to find new and different ways to wow his clientele. So no, its not a painting that you can hang on a wall, but its art nonetheless.Its really, really good.If youe a meatatarian like moi, I don know how you could eat tender piece of suckling pig or let the crispy pig skin melt like butter on your tongue and NOT be impressed. If youe not a meatatarian - how you gonna come up in here and tell me those stuffed dates aren the best thing since sliced crispy pig skin?! The food is excellent. Expect to take a few hours enjoying and savoring it.So why 4 stars and not 5?I had a similarly awesome chef tasting menu meal, except awesomer, in Buenos Aires that rocked my world. Wine included, it cost $35 pp. Different place, different price-bracket, I know, but I only felt its fair to dock a star to show that the same good food doesn have to cost a couple hundos.Parting thought - try the wine pairing. We did the three wines each and it was quite nice. We were each served different wines that corresponded with our courses so nicely, and we were able to try each others wines and try a wider variety than just three pours.Look, I all about being recession-chic. No one wants to pay a lot to be disappointed, which is precisely why I save my money anytime I offered $300 seats at a U2 concert. As for Komi, however, I say its money well-spent., Can I say wow? I think that word adequately expresses my experience at Komi.Food: we had the full degustazione with the 3-glass wine pairing. Since I often overwhelmed by restaurant portions, I was nervous that the degustazione would be too much food for me. It turned out fine, however. Although there are many, many mezze (maybe 15?) theye tiny and youe eating them at such a leisurely pace youe got time to digest. We left full but not feeling stuffed. The full tasting menu was a wonderful way to experience many things I normally might not be inclined to order. Each dish was beautiful and delicious. I think I was more impressed by the food at CityZen, but Komi food was in no way disappointing.Service: perhaps the best Ie experienced in DC. I enjoy fine dining but not the stuffy atmosphere you encounter at many restaurants. The staff at Komi was attentive, gracious and knowledgeable but also low-key and friendly. Several people waited on us throughout the evening, which is often a pet peeve of mine. I usually find it stressful to have lots of different servers coming and going from the table. But Komi staff is so smooth and pleasant that everything flowed perfectly. I also appreciated that although they were personable, the servers weren intrusive: our meal didn become all about interacting with the servers. Price: it crazy expensive. I lucked out since I wasn paying but this isn a cheap evening. Still, we agreed that our experience at Komi was top-notch. Bottom line: If youe able and willing to spend the money, Komi does not disappoint. I already looking for a special occasion that will give me an excuse to visit again., If I could give it six stars, I would. Usually a good restaurant experience washes over me like the tide and its barely a memory the next day. Not so for Komi. I ate there two nights ago and am still having flashbacks. Delicious, delicious flashbacks. I think its important to come into Komi with eyes wide open about what this is; if you want a big fat steak and a plush dining room, go to The Palms. If you want a seemingly endless cavalcade of innovative, mind-blowing little bites in a spare but intimate dining room brimming with candle light, then call exactly one month ahead (the phone lines open at 12 noon on the dot) and start looking forward to it.I would also strongly recommend going big and doing the degustazione. Part of the joy of the meal is not knowing whats coming next.
33|kyirisan-washington|"Such small plates for a $18-22 meal. Unacceptable. Got the hanger steak and it includes only four 1/4 medallions. If you are gonna be that cheap at least serve us bread. I had to go get pizza afterwards to fill me up. My god., Two weeks after opening, and the service was fantastic, the food was incredible, and our groups only regret was not being able to try everything in one visit.Food: the popular tapas/small plate sharing style, but with varying sizes that will not leave anyone hungry. The chef/owner is trained in classical French style, and it shows with deliciously complex sauces that make you want to drink the leftovers, to slow-cooked meats that melt in your mouth, to perfectly cooked seafood. Four of us went hungry, and tried: fluke carpaccio, duck leg confit, skirt steak, prawns, quail, fried tofu, duck liver, beef heart tartar, langosteens, and phillipino scrapple, plus the matcha, black forest, and cheesecake desserts. Washed it down with cocktails, beer, and wine, and complimentary sparkling and still water. There were no misses - we finished every dish. Favorites probably were duck leg confit, which was so tender it didnt need a knife, and the langosteens, in an addictively good broth/sauce. Service: We were there three hours, having a six oclock seating, and ordered two plates at a time, and we never felt rushed. Or waitress truly knew the menu, and when we asked for suggestions (after round two), she have it real thought, not just a reflexive answer. She was very knowledgeable about the wine as well as what the bar had four cocktails - important since ten days in, they havent built a custom cocktail menu yet. Instead, my husband asked the bartender to build a drink around a certain spirit, and he turned out am incredibly tasty concoction, well balanced and paired nicely with the food. Price: we ordered from all over the menu, and half the dishes were at the expense end of the price range. With several rounds of beer, wine, and cocktails, the bill came to just under$350 for for people after tax, or around $90/person. Considering four cocktails at a good DC bar will set you back $60, for the incredible flavor and quality of the food, and the fact we wed never had anything on the menu at another restaurant, and the quality of service, we felt it was absolutely worth it and plan to return.On a Budget: there are dishes from $8-25, so consider that three cheaper plates per person plus one beer or wine might set you back $30, versus three of the bigger, more expensive items as we included. Definitely do-able, and definitely worth trying.Atmosphere: at 6 pm, the place was quiet. At 7 it started to perk up. At 8, it was full and people were hanging out at the bar. Buy 9, when we left, noise was considerably higher, and the place was packed and lively., I surprised there aren more reviews on Yelp since some people already post about their positive experiences on social media/blog! We came here this last Saturday. Reservation was easy to make. I called at 10:32am the morning of (and talked to a very bubbly lady) and got a table of our preferred time. The staff were very friendly. Food was outstanding. There isn a dish we did not like. It hard to believe the restaurant was only opened a bit over a week ago! The reason I gave 4 stars is because the staff were a little slow. The restaurant front seemed to be slightly understaffed as it took a little while to have the waitress checking on us, plus we were sitting next to a table of 4 VIPs. The food did not come out slow though. And while our waitress was able to describe some dishes well, there were a couple dishes we thought she could describe better rather than saying that what we are known for. that customer favorite without explaining why or what so special about the dishes.Okay, about the food. We got deep fried tofu to start. The tofu was fried just right and it reminded me of fried tofu you get from Taiwan or Japan. The sauce was delicious. Scallion and carrots on top added some colors and texture to it.We then moved on to langostine with cauliflower. I thought the flavor was great. The 123 sauce, if I remember correctly, was something that chef Ma uncle made back in the days. It a combination of soy sauce, ginger and garlic (I think? Not 100% sure ) I specially love the pickled ginger as it common to put ginger on top of Taiwanese/Chinese seafood (often steamed fish) dishes which was the only way to make me eat seafood when I was little and this reminds me of that.We also ordered cacio e Pepe, a noodle dish made out of homemade egg noodle, manchego and black truffle. It was our least favorite dish of the evening but it was still good. It wasn greasy not over creamy like many pasta dishes. But it was just tiny bit under-seasoned. The dish was made mild, we guessed, intentionally, to show case the flavor of egg noodle as you could really taste the egg, but we felt it was missing something... Using manchego cheese was a very smart move, but the black truffle didn do much for us as we could barely smell it (don get me wrong, we love truffle, but just not this...)We weren sure if we wanted to order anything from on the ground as I am not a big meat eater. But our waitress mentioned Wings was customer favorite so we thought we try it. We really weren sure what to expect but the wings were unexpectedly surprisingly amazing!!! It was cooked right (not dried or overcooked) and the sauce is oh-so-good!! Who would have thought of making wings with oyster sauce, chili paste (love the kick it gives) and creme fraiche! Last dish of the night before dessert was scallop with coconut milk risotto and basil ice cream. Young & Hungry of Washington City Paper actually mentioned this dish a week ago. The risotto was cooked al dente. My husband who Italian was so happy with the risotto and he wouldn stop talking about the dish the following days to friends and family (and emphasize the al dente which was crucial for him) and did I mention the scallops were nicely seared with perfect caramelization, and I love how I could taste the sweetness of coconut milk in every single bite! The combination of coconut milk and basil ice cream definitely made this dish on the heavier side but it wasn so overwhelmingly heavy that would make you feel guilty for having an extra bite.Matcha pavlova was the option we went for to end our awesome experience. It definitely a very unique dessert. For my husband, it took him 3 bites to announce his love for the dessert because it needs to grow on you according to him. As for me, I liked each components by itself and the idea of combining all but I still deciding how I feel about it. I think Il order it again next time I back to decide..., Yall, its rude to give a nice restaurant one star because of the price, particularly as a first review. Did he not look at the menu before ordering? Pay no attention to the average of stars, because this place is incredible.The dish sizes are explained from the outset to be small plates for the most part, so 2/person is about right unless you get the larger portioned dishes listed at the end of each section. Their hanger steak is the best Ive ever had, so tender and the flavor was through the roof. The real star on that menu is the wings, though. I told the server I wanted to bathe in the sauce, and then 15 minutes later I heard a neighboring table say the exact same thing!! That is very high praise. The food was so good that I will be going back to this place on repeat until I have tasted the entire menu. Or maybe just to house those wings. God they were good., Absolutely incredible. We dined at Kyrisian on a Saturday night. It was crowded but the noise level was well managed. We were easily able to have conversation with our friends. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and made excellent recommendations. As a foursome we decided to order and share everything on the table. I cant say enough about the raw fluke, beef tartare, creme fraiche wings, cauliflower tortellini, scallops and shrimp. There wasnt a morsel left on any of the plates. We were very happy with the selection of wines and beer. Our friends said the bartender was A+ both in service and conversation. Overall excellent experience and looking forward to returning., I have been to all three Chef Mas restaurants, all very good. His food has always been creative. Never disappointed., This place is Steph Curry good. We came here shortly after opening and Chef came correct.Everything we had was exceptional, our personal favorite was the scallop dish with risotto and basil ice cream. Dont ask any more questions just order it. The bar-man was still working on the cocktail list so we tried a couple of properly executed old fashioneds. Bottom line is this is the best new restaurant Ive been to since Convivial. Seriously, throw on some sweats or a three piece, get in gear and eat at Kyirisan. If you dont youre a dope, cheap (see one star review), or a Spurs fan., I want to start this review by saying I wanted to like this place, I really did. I think that with a little time, and refinement it could be great, but it fell quite flat for us. I would come back for a drink because they were quite spectacular, but I would not pay $130 for a dinner that left me hungry ever again. The beef tartare was fine, the beef heart was much chewier than i had anticipated and the sauce it was in had good flavor but was missing a tartness that the single caper berry could not deliver. The chips were an odd combination, all in all it was just bleh. The pickled quail, prawns dish was again fine- the balance was a bit off, the dish lacked salt overall and was just slightly above bland. The scallop and coconut risotto was fantastic, but when the cold ice cream melted on top of the luke warm scallops it left a cold risotto with equally cold scallops in the bowl. Again, the thought was there but the execution was poor. We ordered the oxtail and tendon noodle dish after our waitress raved about it. What the menu, and waitress, failed to mention is that they are not in fact tendon noodles like it says, but actually linguine noodles put into an incredibly bland broth. The duck liver was far from fried on top and the breading was still raw- rendering the dish inedible. The waitress seeing that we did not touch the dish proceeded to ask if we wanted a box and then charged full price. Maybe these are new restaurant kinks? But Ive experienced MUCH better at restaurants that have been open for half the time this place has. We hightailed it over to a pizza joint to eat until we were full, because after paying over $130 we were left absolutely starving., All of our dishes were light and delicious. The wings were the highlight - that sauce tho! - followed closely by the beef. Speaking of beef, my only qualm is that after eating the recommended number of plates to share, plus dessert, my bf and I were still hungry and went next door for a bagel n cream cheese., Atmosphere is great with bright decor and friendly service. Food is adventurous and really good. Wine selection was also great. Highlights include the chicken wings, scallop risotto and the duck breast. Food was a bit interesting to make frequent trips here but if I could give 4.5 stars I would!, Now #trending on DC vibrant food scene is Kyirisan, the latest venture for Chef Tim Ma, which resides in the Shaw neighborhood. If youe familiar with Ma other establishments Water & Wall and Chase the Submarine, youl find Ma French cooking finesse applied to all of his earthly plated dishes here at Kyirisan. Each dish presented simply, yet artistically but with bold, daring flavors -- some of which might leave you hankering for more until your next visit. Bring a plus one or four! Food: During my last couple visits, Ie been lucky enough to have good company which allowed for our table to sample a lot of the dishes on their menu. As a true carnivore, I can attest to the cauliflower tortellini (I think during my visit it was ravioli) being a life changing experience where I wouldn have missed meat for about a good 15 minutes. =D But seriously, it amusingly good and so smooth it will dissolve on your tongue. As other Yelpers have recommended, the deep fried tofu is your icebreaker upon sitting down, but I would challenge that the red curry is a competing starter.For entrees, our group raved about the hanger steak, pickled quail, and langostine with the langostine being my personal favorite -- that 123 sauce should be bottled up for sale! If youe willing to be a bit more daring, I would also suggest trying the seared duck liver and stroopwafel which is Ma play on chicken and waffles. If youe more for playing it safe, I would suggest the halibut or Burmese chicken salad along with the creme fraiche wings which is a staple at Ma other restaurants. Leave room for dessert because youl want in on the cheesecake (but I would opt for the other dessert items if youe allergic to nuts).Space:Adjacent to the bar is a communal table which leaves ample space for thirsty patrons while they wait on their table. Make sure you ask your server or the bartender for a drink recommendation as they are quite the cocktail pros even with virgin concoctions. Striking angled walls, dark blue hues and gold accents make for an inviting, mid-century inspired dining space. Service:Call and make a reservation. Theyl ask if you have any dietary restrictions in advance. Upon sitting down, the server explained the menu layout and portion recommendations depending on the size of your party. Overall, the servers were knowledgeable, attentive, and accommodating of our requests. Tips: Nearby surroundings and landmarks - U St. and Howard TheaterTransportation - If youe strapped for parking spots, I would suggest taking the metro and hopping in an Uber the rest of the way depending on where youe coming from as this is smack dab in the middle of DC on the map., So this place I guess is starting a new restaurant concept where they only take same day reservations. I guess thats better than those that dont take any. But you have to call from 1030-230 on the day you would like to attend. I rang at 1040 and requested a 730 pm table but they were able to accommodate me for a table @ 735. Not so bad.Upon walking in, this place def looks like a brand new restaurant that still hasnt been broken in. Thats ok. Its sparkly and clean. But they def give you a personal experience.The bar and communal seating seems fairly empty but I attribute it to it being new. I see why they do same day reservations as they dont have many tables. Maybe a total of 10-12 tables varying in 2-4 people only. A much more intimate setting perhapsWe order the beef heart tartar. Im not a huge fan but my friends were. They said it was def rich and tasty but not the best that theyve had.the fried tofu appetizer was surprisingly the winner as it was light and airy with a great sauce. the sauce seemed very similar to a black bean sauce taken down a notch with saltiness.Moved on to the eggplant appy. Lightly cooked eggplant with some tasty curry sauce. The pickled additions were good but I dont know if that really compliments the curried sauce.Next was the langostine. The meat was cut up and in the sauce. I dont know if I would order this again. I dont know if the sauce really brought out the flavor of the langostine and the meat wasnt super tender as I would hope it would beMy friends ordered the duck with fried prawn. Their review was that it was so so.So overall experience, I would give this place B-. Pros- tofu, personal customer service attention and ambienceCons- reservation system although it wasnt super hard but its hard to make a final judgement about it unless I go again, most of the sauces were somewhat lack of flavor Would I go again?I really dont know if I need to and there was nothing that I had that I desperately needed to have again., The restaurant was a great date night spot! Loved the wine list, and they also had fun cocktails to try. We got two appetizers, a couple entrees and a dessert. Everything was delicious!! The food is light, but full of flavor and very visually appealing. The place was slammed with people, so the staff was hustling, but they pulled it off and gave us a great night! Also, the location is fun for a night out, because there are plenty of bars and shops to stop in at if you want to walk about more after dinner for a nightcap. Id definitely go back., I first came across Chef Tim Ma after attending a Taste of the Nation event benefitting No Kid Hungry. There was probably a hundred restaurants at the event, but Chef Ma stood out to me as having one of the best small bites of the evening . I was impressed from that experience and was therefore excited to try his new restaurant in DC.My favorite from the evening: 1- Deep Fried Tofu appetizer : Normally, Im not a huge fan of deep fried tofu but Kriyisans version was light and delicious , and the black pepper sauce that came with it was amazing. This was an appetizer but I wish I had had some rice to pour the sauce on, so that I could savor it . 2- Matcha Pavlova dessert . One of the most unique Asian desserts you will find in DC. The pavlova was light, not too sweet, and had a mild green tea flavor. 3- Filipino Scrapple. Delicious pork dish, reminded me a little bit of a hash with the runny egg. What didnt do it for me:Scallop with Coconut Risotto. Coconut risotto was unique but the basil ice cream was not a helpful addition; it made it overly creamy. Also, I didnt think the flavor of the scallop itself went well with the risotto, so the dish didnt come together to me. Overall, good food experience. I would recommend the Asian- inspired dishes to the ones that were more European inspired ones. The space was really pleasant and had a cool and innovative design. Service wise, I thought it was very helpful that they asked over the phone in advance if there were any allergies in the party. My suggestions if the restaurant is reading this: larger spoons for dessert and bowls in addition to plates. :), The location is in the new and upcoming Shaw part of DC and the interior of the restaurant is just clean and cut gorgeous. Those that are familiar with Chef Tim Ma will see some old favorites and gain some new favorites here at Kyirisan. Old favorites such as the creme fraiche wings (which by the way just made it on the front cover of the latest The Washingtonian) and scallops over coconut risotto with a dollop of basil ice cream. I havent had the scallop dish in a good couple of years... man o man is it awesome. The ice cream may sound weird... but it really adds to the dish and is not as sweet as it sounds. Its more like a butter that makes the coconut risotto so much more creamy and yummy. My new favorite is the duck confit over truffled fried brussels. I did not see the duck confit on my second visit... hopefully it will make a reappearance. Other new favorites include the hanger steak and Cacio e Pepe, which has egg noodles, manchgo cheese, and thick cut black truffles. Of course you cant leave without trying dessert... MATCHA PAVLOVA!!!! DO IT!!!! Its almost like a giant macaron.. .and that scoop of black sesame creme... it is all good... the cheesecake and raspberry cobbler. The service is on point and drinks are amazing! Try the Raybans and Charlottes Lemonade Stand. Tim the bartender is awesome and will set you right!, I took a friend here for her birthday. We were both unimpressed by the food. The restaurant was cute and trendy, however the food was terrible. There signature cauliflower pasta was bland, the hanger steak tasted like liver (yuck), and the wings were just ok. To make matters worse my friend was sick the next day from the food she ate. Never again., Spectacular, every dish. We tried more than half the menu. Not one thing was a disappointment., This place was awesome! We went right when they opened, and yet there were none of the usual opening week kinks to work out. The space is really interesting and we kept looking around. We started off with bartenders choice and were both pleased with our cocktails. And all of our food was great, although the pickled quail had a bit of an odd aftertaste. But the shrimp that came with it was much yummier. I blame our selection, not the chef for that. Weve both spent time in China and felt like it very closely matched flavors there. The scallops were the winner, by far. We also really enjoyed the halibut. The peanut sauce had a great flavor and the fish was perfectly cooked. The service was friendly and very attentive, but not overly so. Ive recommended this place to everyone I know, so youre probably not getting in anytime soon. Sorry! I will say, same day reservations are a total pain though. Thankfully, I wasnt the one responsible for making the reservation., Amazing food from a Chinese chef incorporating his French culinary training. What makes it even better is the amazing customer service as well! The waitress was personable and always available. The manager would also come around and check on us too. We had the fried tofu which is a MUST. We wanted to drink the sauce. Cacio e Pepe also great. They didnt have the raw fluke but had a special dish for another raw fish and it was delicious. We plan on going back to try the creme fraice wings. Its now on my top restaurants of DC!, Loved the Cacio e Pepe, 5 stars. Burmese chicken salad was okay, strong fish sauce flavor. Filet minon was tender and flavorful. Service was inconsistently attentive. Decor feels very 70s. Would go again, essentially to eat more cacio e pepe., Found easy parking, and seated right away. Ordered three dishes for two of us and it was plenty. The flavors were unique and exceptional. The chicken wings managed to be crispy, not burned, covered in sauce that did not wilt them. The sauce, with creme fraiche still had a faint touch of heat and was bursting with flavor. They are reason enough to return. The special of the evening, a scallop with soba noodles, diced celery and yuzu was meant to be combined by the diner. It was remarkably tasty but another scallop would have been even better. One just wasnt enough. And the fried green tomatoes had a marvelous coating, great soy/sesame sauce for the rabbit and turnip cake (which tasted more like potato than either of those ingredients) and was also delicious. Deconstructed black forest cake with tart cherry ice cream was the perfect sweet end to a wonderful meal. With one glass of wine and two coffees the bill with tip came to $100. Well worth the creativity and flavors. But the noise level was terrible and even in the restroom the music was very loud!, I was highly disappointed in my experience mostly due to the service but also partially to the food. I have been a long time fan of Tim Ma having been to Maple Ave Restaurant and Water and Wall several times.We were immediately told that our table was not ready and they apologized for the wait. Im usually fine with this but when you dont get seated and have your drink orders taken until after 1 hour past your reservation time, it becomes a problem. They made up for this with a round of free champagne, chicken wings and fried tofu for the table. This definitely helped smooth things over but the initial issues were symbolic of what was to come. Our waitress was very nice and a fine server, but she was definitely covering too much ground. We had to flag her down throughout the whole dinner and even had to go to the bar to get another drink because she wasnt present. I dont fault her because the whole restaurant was slammed and she was covering indoor/outdoor tables. The management team really needs to get things under control to handle demand.I felt the food lacked complexity and was mediocre. The wings are a great staple of his and never disappoints. The fried tofu was dry even though it is served over a sea of soy based black pepper sauce and tasted like something you can get at any strip mall Japanese restaurant. The hanger steak had delicious flavors but was served with a Carrot Fresno Salad that overpowered the beef. The carrots were also shaved quite long and a little difficult to manage. I was also able to try the scallops, halibut and duck confit from my other guests and they didnt compare to the congee that I ordered. While congee may seem like it couldnt hold its own against the other dishes, the flavor profiles were complex and blended together perfectly making it the best dish of the night. If I was to go back I would definitely order it again., We were rather disappointed in KYIRISAN. We been very much looking forward to an outstanding experience. Although we were impressed with the stunning look of the restaurant, we found the food to be not more than ordinary, and the prices very high. Not what we expected at all, given the hype that this restaurant has gotten. True,...we shared ONLY one dish , the scallops and risotto with basil ice-cream, which has been raved about, and sounded incredibly delish-- this was a late after-dinner snack for us. The portion was small for the price; the taste- just okay -- not memorable. The drinks ( Manhattans) were good. We don expect to be returning any time soon, although we hope to be open enough to give it a second try. The restaurant was not conveniently located for us, and in an interesting but unfamiliar area. Had been interested in trying Tim Ma other restaurant, Water & Wall, but our enthusiasm has now been dampened. Oh well ~~. Hopefully this was not indicative of their typical cuisine. The waitstaff, particularly the ladies ( I think Julia(?) and Annette(?) were SUPER NICE and accommodating. Look forward to a much improved experience in the future., This review is for he fried tofu. Its great, perfectly spicy. Not too many Vegan options but I go here after work with friends. Nice ambiance and I will be back., A lovely edition too the neighborhood.Food and service was exceptional.Scallops were excellent and loved Brussels sprout dish.Will return for sure, Wow -- what an amazing dining experience! Kyirisan is a brand new fusion restaurant in the Shaw District. It really hard to explain as the food is so unusual and innovative -- kind of a Chinese, French blend but with a lot of unusual seafood dishes. But everything was just spectacular!I highly recommend sharing dishes to try the range of food on display. Highlights were the sea bass, halibut, fried green tomatoes, fried tofu, and especially the duck confit (which you can miss). We also had the special of the day which was so unique -- fried blowfish tails with ramp kim chi! I normally don order dessert but don miss the sesame balls and the almond cake, both amazing. Food is beautifully prepared and presented, and packed with flavor.What really made the evening special was Rich, our server. He was so incredibly helpful and funny, we were laughing all night. At one point, he literally sent back a bottle of wine we had ordered because he said it tastes like butt -- I not making that up! And he brought us a fabulous Pinot Noir instead. I would go back to Kyirisan in a heartbeat just to experience Rich service again!Don miss this place!, Kyirisan is another hotspot in the up and coming Shaw neighborhood, which used to be pretty (to be blunt) ghetto. Its adjacent to U St and I havent been there in quite a while so was pleasantly surprised to see that its got lots of new construction/apts/hipster shops/and restaurants! Kyirisan is really modern inside with light wood and sharp angles on the back wall; some of the panels painted in navy blue with hints of gold. Kyirisan is billed as a Chinese and French fusion restaurant. While I did enjoy my meal, my bone to pick with Kyirisan is that the food and the ingredients were, for the most part, not Chinese in the slightest!! Not only did nothing taste or look Chinese, but many of the ingredients used were ingredients that are NEVER used in Chinese cooking at all (raw fish? fish sauce? brussel sprouts? risotto? coconut?). I can see where some French inspiration came in with the duck confit, but I really felt let down about the misleading Chinese labeling. Its basically New American cuisine being served here. We ordered:-Raw royal seabass w/fish sauce aoili, orange slices, miso, and thinly sliced radish: The ingredients went amazingly together and it was a nice light appetizer. The raw fish was diced up finely and very fresh. The radish gave a great crunch while the oranges gave a bit of sweetness and the miso a bit of saltiness. Great colors, textures, and flavors. -Scallops with coconut risotto and basil ice cream: This was delicious, if not a tad sweet for an entree. The scallops were PERFECTLY seared and so good, but a bit small. I really liked the richness of the coconut risotto but it was on the sweet side and was reminiscent of a Thai dessert (sticky coconut rice and mango). The basil ice cream melted in nicely. (This dish was the give-away to me that Tim Ma owns this restaurant... This exact same dish is served at his restaurant Maple Ave in Vienna, VA). - Black truffle congee with natto, egg yolk, duck confit: This was too salty for me. It was also a pretty small bowl... beautiful presentation though! There was almost no black truffle flavor at all but the other flavors did go well together and it was a really rich entree. This was the one and only dish that did have some clear Chinese influence, though.-Sous Vide Duck Confit, caramelized Brussels, Apple Cider Gastrique $18: The duck was so tender and really tasty, but this was a tad salty too (or maybe its jsut cause we ate it right after the super salty congee?). Also the duck and brussels were in a mayonnaisey-type sauce, which threw me off. The Brussels were perfectly cooked and slightly browned.Service was exceptional - attentive, helpful, knowledgeable. I actually hadnt realized walking in that Kyirisan is owned by the same owner of Water & Wall and Maple Ave... Im not a huge fan of either of the two latter restaurants. But I have to say I really enjoyed my dinner here and it kind of made me want to give the other two another try soon!, Honestly, this place is my new favorite dining spot in DC. The food is really, really good. I would avoid the hangar steak and the too-sweet lavender bourbon drink. I wasnt a fan. But the offal salad, the fried green tomatoes and blowfish were excellent. The offal salad had this delicious tamarind sauce! I actually ate tripe, folks! The ponzu that came with the blowfish was tangy and had the perfect amount of vinegar, and I loved the spicy carrots. The star for me however was the sake brined watermelon. The burrata that comes with it was divine. The spicy pineapple cocktail I had was delicious and the deconstructed Black Forest cake was to die for. The service was super on point. I felt very welcome and the evening was just lovely. We cant wait to go back and try more dishes!, Enjoyed a fantastic meal at Kyirisan last night. There were 4 of us and our waitress Kathleen (who was terrific) suggested 8 plates which was perfect. We started with the sake infused watermelon and peach and burrata salad, a wonderful combination of flavors. Every dish was memorable and one I would order again. If I had to choose some standouts I would say the scallops and risotto which came with a scoop of basil ice cream. Sounds odd but the flavor combination was outstanding. Also the duck confit was lick the plate clean. My only complaint is the scallop dish only came with 3 scallops. I would have preferred to pay more for the dish but have 4 scallops so everyone gets one to themselves. Other than that a perfect meal., World class. Nuff said. Tyrone and Kathleen are amazing too. This is food as art. But not over priced. Come and feed your senses., Its a very well executed restaurant with the fun menu. The operations seem organized. The servers are lively and passionate about their food and restaurant. I strongly recommend everyone to try here. You wont be disappointed., This place is a real foodie experience. Everything is delicious!Our waitress, Kathleen, gave us her recommendations and was spot on. Tyrone made us feel welcomed!I dont even like Sea Bass! The raw royal sea bass was flavorful and delicate on the palate. The deep fried tofu and black pepper sauce was great and the sauce pairs well with the hanger steak.We also had pork belly with Kimchi and it was soo meaty, very minimal fat.The Pan-seared scallops with risotto was soo creamy. The ice cream compliments the texture of the risotto and makes it extra creamy.This is my new favorite spot! Compliments to Culinary Master Chef Slayer Tim!, We are somewhat recent transplants from NYC who spent our early days in DC complaining about the lack of an interesting food scene. I must say, after relocating to the Shaw neighborhood and testing some of the newest restaurants, I am pleasantly surprised. Lots of good stuff up and coming in this area and Kyirisan is no exception. Im not sure if id necessarily call it French and Chinese, but I will call it good. I loved the truffle congee (and I actually normally hate congee) and the brined watermelon burrata salad. We also tried a few of the seafood dishes including halibut and scallops and they were a hit as well. The menu is designed for sharing plates, which is something Im always excited about, the cocktail menu is tasty as well. Top that off with very friendly, very attentive service and this is officially in our rotation., The tops: Tim and Joey have done it again. Great surroundings; modern, clean, but not over designed or antiseptic. But what important, at Kyirisan, is the food and drink. Each cocktail, from my classic vodka martini to their own concoctions, were perfectly balanced and chilled. And the food: Don miss the watermelon burrata, the sea bass, the wings, the tofu, the scallops. I could go on. Tyrone at the door is a gem and I wish he lived with me so I could be greeted by his warm smile everyday. Not the best, but totally forgiveable: our waiter was a bit over eager, taking a full 5 minutes to talks about every item on the menu, and then asking, did I cover everything? YES--and then some, thank you. The restaurant is also really loud. I am not an old lady, I just want to enjoy the company of my guests. And the lighting... there are great industrial warm exposed electric lights, but they get lost and lose impact because of the high recessed spot lighting fluorescents which are oppressively bright and unflattering.Can those be dimmed a bit? Overall, we will be back for certain!, Our dinner at Kyirisan was the best meal Ie had in a long time and probably the best dinner Ie had in DC all year. Kyirisan is somewhat retro looking with geometric shapes all over the restaurant and the colors give it a comforting but modern feel. The Chinese-French menu is worldly and elegant. The menu is small plates broken down into veg, sea, meats. We started with our lighter two choices. The deep fried tofu with black pepper sauce, scallion and pickled carrots ($9) had a deep flavor and enough crisp freshness from the scallions and carrots that the tofu was still light. The pan-seared scallops with coconut risotto, basil ice cream and scallions ($17) was to die for. The scallops had a perfect sear and my concern over the temperature of the risotto was unfounded; despite mixing in the ice scream, it was still plenty hot. This dish was so creamy (with no cream!) and was the perfect marriage of the Chinese and French flavors. It was perfect. For our next course we had our heavier two options. The Chesapeake blowfish was deep fried with the back bone and tail still in (four fish), served over spiced carrots with a bowl of ramp bulb kimchi and a bowl of kombu ponzu ($20). A little trickier to eat if you care about looking graceful; luckily I don so I held the tail in one hand while spooning ponzu and then using chopsticks to add veggies. So ladylike, I know. Despite these three great dishes, the star of the evening was the sous vide duck confit with caramelized Brussels, apple cider gastrique and romanesco ($18). It was rich, decadent, creamy and filling. The portion of duck was huge and honestly a huge surprise that we got so much for just $18. The cider had a nice sweetness to balance the Brussels and the meat itself was cooked so perfectly, so tender, like only sous vide can do.The meal had been so good that there was no way to say no to dessert (each $10). I was thrilled to see a hazelnut dessert that wasn Nutella flavored. The custard cheesecake, chocolate hazelnut ganache, hazelnut butter and hazelnut soil was perfect and the swipe of ganache didn make the dish taste like Nutella at all, the tartness of the cheesecake balanced the flavors and kept the nuttiness front and center. I convinced Justin to get the warm flourless almond cake with vanilla poached peaches and Thai basil gel so I could try the cake. The cake itself was great and the basil gel and ginger ice cream pulled in the Asian fusion flavors Kyirisan is focused on. Justin liked it so much that he ordered a third dessert - the Black Forest cake with chocolate genoise, tart cherries three ways and chantilly creme. I really liked the creme and the two ice creams in this dessert but my favorite by far was the hazelnut. So many great dishes at Kyirisan yet the best part of the evening was the service. Blake was the most professional waiter Ie had the pleasure of meeting in DC. He was attentive and friendly while being humble and giving us privacy for our date night. When there was a back up at the bar he even brought us a short pour of cava to sweeten the wait. There are not enough words to describe how professional Blake was. He is the model that other restaurants should train their staff to emulate.The one area of Kyirisan that was not quite as developed or refined was the cocktail program. The menu is short and not as creative as the food menu. The patio pounders portion of the drink menu definitely lived up to the title and it was nice to see cocktails in DC for only $10. They definitely need to be offered by the pitcher, that would be perfect for the big communal tables at the front of the restaurant. We ordered the three most creative options: Ray Bands and Boat Shoes (gin, cranberry, ginger, lime), Not From Charlotte Lemonade Stand (sherry, gin, lemon, simple, sage) and A Midsummer Night Dram (bourbon, lavender, lemon). All were very nice and easy to drink. The sage on the Charlotte was particularly nice and fragrant. To pair with dessert we went with the $15 Dealer Choice option - giving a spirit and two flavors and letting the bartender get creative. My cognac + vanilla + desserty turned out great (cognac, almond liqueur, Baileys, bourbon vanilla, concerto, with dark chocolate drizzled on the glass). Justin scotch + baking spices + stonefruit went through two iterations and didn quite hit the mark since there was some miscommunication between the beverage director and the bartender so he ended up getting a flight of digestifs instead. Despite the goof (the repeated addition of very hot spices instead of baking spices), both Tim and Karakayc were very sweet and very understanding. Thank you Kyirisan for a lovely date night and a nearly flawless meal. This will be my top recommendation for the rest of the year., 3.5/5, to be exact. It was good, but not great. I love food and can be critical with places with hype. Reservation was hard to get; Kyirisan is definitely the hotspot in town these days.As we came in for our 8pm Saturday reservation, I immediately noticed the geometric theme and neutral colors. They made me felt like dining in a West Elm (not a bad thing - just an observation). Our server was nice, even though he broke one of the plates. The dinnerware are all custom-made for the restaurant, and some of our plates look like ceramic pancakes (see photo). For drinks, my boyfriend got an IPA and I got the Midsummer Nights Dram, which was very tasty and refreshing.Onto the main event: THE FOOD!TL; DR: food is 3/5. Some dishes are great, some have good elements separately that dont really compliment or do anything together on the same plate. 1. Deep-fried tofu with black pepper sauce:My friend raved about this dish, and I was a bit disappointed. The fried silken tofu was only half in the sauce, so I expected the other half to be crispy. Ot was not. The black pepper sauce was salty and lacked depth. 2.5/52. Sake-Brined Watermelon | Poached Peaches | Smoked Watermelon Granite | Burrata | Pine Nut Puree | Miso GochujangGreat dish! Everything is great, especially the burrata. 5/53. Hanger Steak | Kalamansi Baste | Carrot Fresno Salad | White Soy Herb Churri The steak was great, just needed a bit of salt. The carrot salad was plain: the sauce was watery and didnt add anything to the carrot. 3.5/54. Pan-Seared Scallops | Coconut Risotto | Basil Ice Cream | Scallions Probably my favorite dish of the night. The scallops were perfectly seared, the coconut risotto was creamy and the basil ice cream was an awesome touch to the dish. I kinda wish that instead of scallions, there were sweet peas instead to balance the creaminess of the dish. 4.5/55. Sesame Ball | Mango Sauce | Pineapple Compote | Honey Ricotta Ice Cream | Chocolate-Coconut Pocky Whoever is in charge of ice-cream here should get a gold star. I have no clue what was the sesame ball on top of corn flakes/granola doing in this dish. 4/56. Warm Flourless Almond Cake | Vanilla Poached Peaches | Thai Basil Gel | Ginger Ice Cream | Shortbread Crumble | Candied Ginger TuilleVery good. The almond cake was warm, and the thai basil gel was a great touch to the sweetness. 5/5, 3.5 stars. My good experiences at Water and Wall, the tone of the place and a lot of the plating and food just sets up high expectations, so Im judging by pretty high standards. It was easy to get a reservation for 6:30 on a Saturday for three people with just two days notice. However, I haaate the online reservation system they use. Strangely unintuitive for something that should be super simple - you need to download the app to look at your account?? Just stick with OpenTable and dont reinvent the wheel, people. Decor is much nicer than Water and Wall. No weird lights. All very modern and elegant with some lovely botanical touches. About half the space is the bar and a large bar island and half the space is dining tables. Tables are close together but not soooo close you feel like you can join in on your neighbors conversation. But, a big miss for me is that the acoustics completely amplifies all conversation, so peoples pretty normal conversations are LOUD and god forbid someone laughs. Our server was friendly and had lots of good recommendations and explained the menu well, however there was quite a lull between when our entrees were cleared and when he checked on us again. The hostess dropped the dessert menus and then he came back around to explain. One strange hiccup in service - They very nicely offer both still and sparkling water and my table had gotten sparkling. However, in the middle of eating our entrees, a busboy came and took the half empty carafe and came back with a full carafe of still. The food! The server recommended two dishes per person or 2-2.5 per person if we were all sharing, and we were very comfortably full with two starters, three entrees (theyre small but not tiny), and two desserts split between three people. The deep fried tofu with pepper sauce was outstanding. I was really pleasantly surprised by the lovely light coating on the tofu (rice flour) and the incredibly deep, flavorful sauce. I would eat that sauce on everything! And the server even said he would reserve it for us to eat with our steak, which makes me think they should just go ahead and serve the sauce with the steak. The blowfish was another fun dish, though I wanted the fish to be more flavorful after the tofu. The tails are meaty, and the accompaniments tasted very fresh. We got the special of the night, which was a sous vide then pan seared Alaskan salmon. Definitely my favorite entree. The salmon was beautifully cooked with an extremely tender texture, and worked well with the delicate and bright flavors of the blueberries, broth, and amazing basil puree. The hanger steak tasted strangely liver-y to me, and I was glad we had the leftover pepper sauce from the tofu to pour over it liberally. The halibut was well cooked, but the sauce was too sweet for me. For dessert, we went with our servers recommendations of the almond flourless cake and cheesecake. The cheesecake was wonderfully light and the hazelnut was delicious. Basically youre eating a very fancy take on deconstructed Nutella and who doesnt love that? The almond cake itself was kinda meh - it was more artificial almond flavoring than real almond flavor to me, but everything else on the plate was balanced and worked so well together that Id get it again and just let someone else eat the cake part. Would come again and try to eat on their patio to avoid the noise of the inside space., I was so excited to try out Kyirisan as it is one of hotspots in dc right now and it has all of the great reviews on yelp! I left a bit disappointed, but would still go back to try new dishes and give it another chance.Overall, I think this spot has a bit of an identify crisis. I know its French and Chinese fusion, but many of the dishes barely had French/Chinese but many other influences instead. If they had actually labelled this a New american restaurant with some French and asian influences, it would be a lot more relevant to this restaurant. For example, we ordered royal seabass (raw)) with fish sauce aoili (neither chinese nor french, but vietnamese/southeast asian). This had great flavor and the fish was very fresh. Next, we had the scallops with coconut rissoto. This was a delicious dish, but again, coconut risotto? That is very thai/ southeast asian influenced. Neither the french nor chinese use coconut a lot in their cooking. I would say the only chinese influence I saw was the black truffle congee - and its b/c its congee! I was really excited to try this dish b/c its black truffle and duck confit - two things i can definitely not deny. well, to my disappointment, it was much too salty AND there was barely any black truffle flavor. I wouldnt order this again.Duck confit - this would probably be the only french influence i see, but they he blends it with brussel sprouts - a vegetable i know the chinese definitely do not use (my grandma wouldnt even recognize this vegetable) and I dont believe its a very common vegetable used in the french cuisine either! Still a tender and flavorful dish, albieit a little salty.Service was very attentive! I would be back to try more dishes but probably wouldnt go out of my way for it., Went with a group of 6 people to check out the restaurant. Service was fantastic. Staff did a great job and was attentive. The food was OK but really not worth the price in my opinion. Small portions and on average nearly 20 bucks for a small one-person portion (Id say two dishes minimum to feed one person is necessary). We tried almost everything on the menu and everything was good, just not anything super memorable. After looking at menu again Id say halibut, tofu and truffle congee were standouts. Expected a little more given how people talked about this place., I hadn even heard of Kyirisan when my friend made RW reservations, but I always up for trying something new. I knew we were in for a treat when the other girl sharing our Uber pool saw us getting out here and said Ooooooh that place is amazingWe were seated right on time, and unlike other restaurants, they didn make us wait for the whole party to arrive, which was great. It gave me plenty of time to make an ordering plan with and review the wine list. Our server was really attentive, and very helpful in making menu choices. The service stayed really good through the entire meal.For RW, you get two savory choices and one dessert option. There were six of us, and it was obvious we had all done similar yelp research as we all ordered the duck confit, and most ordered scallops as the second savory dish. A couple went with the short ribs instead of scallops. None of us ventured to any of the other delicious looking options like crispy tofu, sea bass, or sake-brined watermelon. At first I was skeptical - really, none of us could branch out? Once I got the duck in front of me, I completely understood. That duck confit is mixed with perfectly charred brussels with a slightly sweet, salty sauce and it is quite possibly one of the best things Ie eaten in a long time. The scallops are also delicious, and come atop a creamy bed of coconut risotto and basil ice cream. I wasn sure about the ice cream, but it blended in well and the scallops were cooked perfectly. The *only* thing I would critique is that we kind of needed a spoon for the risotto. Eating risotto with a lot of liquid is hard with a fork. The short ribs were also good, but I felt the duck confit really stole the show.The final dessert round came out, and we had all chosen either the cheesecake or matcha dessert. I loved the hazelnut spreads that were sitting under the perfectly creamy, delicious cheesecake. I ended up, quite literally, licking my plate with my fingers to make sure I got all of it.Overall, this meal was incredible. The RW is a great way to try several things on the menu. We absolutely loved it and will certainly be back. As for ambiance, it can get really loud and hard to talk. But once it started quieting down, we noted the music was like 90s to early 2000s rap, which we really enjoyed. It kind of an odd choice but we loved it! Highly highly recommend!, We came here with a group of six for restaurant week and I was SO impressed! Wee a bunch of foodies, so wee hard to wow. The service was incredibly friendly and attentive right off the bat. Our glasses were never empty, and our server was very knowledgeable and accommodating, especially when he found out there were nut allergies. He went back to check several times to make sure certain dishes were ok for us to eat, which we very much appreciated, having had terrible experiences with assurances at other upscale DC restaurants from similarly famous chefs. The ambiance was very fresh and new. Almost an urban but earthy vibe. The huge windows were especially beautiful, and gave it a very open feel. However, (and this is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5), there are a lot of hard surfaces in the restaurant and not much fabric or soft textures, which results in it being EXTREMELY loud. I not someone who cares much about a loud restaurant- I 26, I like to go to concerts, and I like to rage, but this was to the point where we could barely hear the person next to us if they were almost yelling. I think this is easily fixable with the addition of some fabric panels, etc., and regardless I would still come back for the amazing food! Once it got late and several tables left, we could hear the 90s/2000s rap music, which we didn expect, but really loved!We usually like to get a variety of things as a group to try a bit of everything, but for some reason we all ONLY wanted to try the duck confit and the scallops and risotto from the savory section. The scallops and coconut risotto were AMAZING. The scallops are huge, and the risotto was perfectly creamy enough to complement them without being overpowering. The duck confit was incredibly tender and a very large portion when mixed with the brussels sprouts. Ie been pretty over brussels sprouts as a restaurant fad for a while because theye so ubiquitous here, but I LOVED this version! I tasted my friend portion, and hers was just the slightest hint too salty, but mine was seasoned perfectly, so it may just have been an anomaly with her portion. For dessert, we all got either the hazlenut cheesecake or the chocolate/matcha option. You really couldn go wrong. I was a big fan of the cheesecake (you can really tell when it freshly made!) and hazlenut spread (homemade Nutella? HELLO?!), but I slightly preferred the chocolate and matcha because I just love choclate that much. However, youl be happy either way. I would love to come back and try more things on the menu. Highly recommend!, Very nice establishment. We were seated on time per our reservation. The server poured us warm water in glasses with no napkins under them. Other tables were given chilled water and napkins for the glasses. We asked for and received chilled water. This was the only bump in,service. I started with the sake brined watermelon and my spouse had the pan seared scallops. Both dishes were beautifully prepared and delicious. Our next course was deep fried tofu and soy braised short rib. Once again, two works of art. I would recommend providing a spoon for the deep fried tofu. Dessert was a slight let down. The custard cheesecake was rather bland. The hazelnut sauce was so so. I would prefer a smaller portion with more flavors and better presentation. I would still return and recommend this place to friends., Went for restaurant week and wasnt disappointed. Id strongly recommend the ribs and duck!, Kyirisan is absolutely amazing and very deserving of the hype - I had been wanting to go here since it opened, and since seeing picture upon picture of the ice cream scallop dish. I mean, come on. It looked unreal. My friend and I were able to get a Saturday night reservation - while it is annoying that they only open reservations 2 weeks in advance, I had no problem getting a table which was nice. The restaurant itself is very minimalist - clean and pretty with some funky plant holders on the wall. The focus is really on the food here, as it should be. I wish I could remember our waitress name because she was awesome, and had some great recommendations - we obviously wanted the scallops, and then decided to also get the deep fried tofu, the hanger steak, and the duck confit. Deep Fried Tofu - really great - the sauce was amazing - our waitress suggested keeping the sauce to use with the Hanger Steak later which was great. We literally were drinking it with our spoons at the end to get every last bite. Pan-seared scallops with coconut risotto and basil ice cream - Oh YES. You cannot go to Kyirisan and miss this dish. You simply cannot. I would never in a million years have paired these three things together, but it really works - the ice cream melts into the risotto and makes it rich and creamy and delicious. And the scallops were huge and perfectly seared. Hanger Steak - This was probably my least favorite - it was still delicious, but nothing that blew me away. Although the carrot salad that accompanied it was really really tasty. Sous Vide Duck Confit with Caramelized Brussel Sprouts - I never would have ordered this, as I am really not much of a duck person. But our waitress convinced us, assuring us that she too was not a fan of duck but that this dish made her a believer. She was absolutely right - this was hands down the best dish of the night. So creamy and rich, and the charred brussel sprouts added the perfect amount of crunch. After all of that, we still managed to fit in one dessert - the sesame ball with mango sauce and honey ricotta ice cream. The perfect end to the meal - it was just the right amount of sweetness and the little pocky stick was a great garnish!Overall, everything was pretty awesome - I will definitely be going back, for the duck alone., Believe the hype Some incredibly creative dishes here, all beautifully presented and delicious. We tried the chicken wings, scallops, veal short rib (special) and a bone marrow mousse/ice cream dessert (special). Maybe the best scallop dish Ive ever tasted. Dining area manages to feel simultaneously communal and private. Loved the light bulb lighting and the angular walls and bar space. Attentive, fast, smart and friendly servers. They bring a fun little guest book for you to write and sketch in. Such a nice touch. The owners work and hang out here and make sure the experience exceeds your expectations. They also opened Water & Wall in Arlington - two STRONG thumbs up for that, too.Wonderful addition to Shaw. Go tomorrow., Upon walking in, I immediately had second thoughts. The stark, modern space was positively booming (lots of concrete and wood and very little in the way of soft furnishings to absorb sound). It was also packed with trendy 20-somethings mentally crafting their social-media reviews and taking selfies. I felt old. But the host was very welcoming, and we forged ahead.Two Millennials next to us were eagerly discussing their dishes, so we got some tips on what to order. The beer selection was good - plenty of affordable craft options. We decided to order a couple of dishes and see how things went before committing to a whole meal. Our approach worked perfectly with the small-plate format.We had:-Sea bass with orange and fish sauce aioli, which was finely diced and reminded me of kinilaw or coconut-milk ceviche. It was positively delicious, beautifully presented in a big swipe across a clay platter. So far, so good. The neighboring table did not steer us wrong.-Scallops with coconut-milk rice and basil ice cream. The small sea scallops were perfectly cooked and served in a loose, creamy risotto-like coconut rice. The melting savory ice cream was a fun play on temperature and textural differences. Really excellent.-Black pepper tofu - crispy starch-dusted cubes of tofu in a deeply savory, soy-heavy sauce. I detected Maggi and maybe ponzu ssauce - my husband agreed there was something very familiar about it (we cook a lot of Asian at home). This was perfectly decent but cried out for rice to balance the extremely salty sauce and bulk out the small portion (maybe 6 small cubes of tofu).-Filipino scrapple - cubes of pork belly, thin slices of pig ear, fingerling potato, pickled papaya, and fried egg. This was a homey, rich, comforting dish. My hubby wasn all that crazy about it, but I liked it. I thought it needed some crunch, though - either the pig ear or the belly would have benefited from a crisp up in hot oil. A little squeeze of citrus would have been welcome, too.Since we were celebrating, we ordered dessert. Black Forest cake turned out to be playfully deconstructed with a chocolate cake round, a quenelle of creme Chantilly, another of chocolate mousse, and tart cherries 3 ways (don quiz me, I only saw pitted cooked cherries and a subtle cherry drizzle...). This was great, except the cake itself was a little lackluster. It tasted vauely dry - possibly baked a day or two prior or microwaved. But everything else on the plate was delicious, and the server was kind enough to bring out two small glasses of champagne on the house to mark the occasion. Not to mention the birthday candle. Very nice touches.Overall, while not a flawless experience, we were pretty impressed. The service was warm, attentive, and knowledgeable. Our plates (custom pottery, really handsome) and cutlery were promptly cleared with each round of dishes. Water glasses (sparkling or still) stayed full. The young lady taking care of us remembered the occasion and paced the meal well. Our bill came in around $70 for two beers and everything we ordered, which is only about $20 more than we spent on pub grub and drinks at Ventnors in AdMo the night before. This was decidedly better.At the end of the night, I leaned across the table and shouted (hey, it was LOUD), This reminds me a lot of Rose Luxury! Playful food, informal yet engaged service, and generous gestures - all in all were very reminiscent of DC most buzzed-about restaurant.I think wel be hearing more about Kyirisan. Too bad the name is so hard to remember!, I have mixed feelings about this restaurant. The special-a scallop soba noodle dish-was the highlight of the meal. My friends and I were blown away by it. Unfortunately, every other savory dish we had was a disappointment. The tofu was mediocre. The duck was extremely salty. The pigs ear scrabble went under worst dish I have ever eaten for two of us. We did enjoy the desserts. Potentially will give this place a second chance., thanks to WP, first time visit during restaurant week. admittedly, i was uncertain whether this restaurant would offer truly innovative and interesting take on asian cuisine, or if id rather save time/$ and stay in rockville (which, im said to say, was the case for the maketto). thankfully, im very pleased to report the former (though admittedly we deliberately didnt order the tofu, which looked less intriguing than other options). new and unexpected combinations of foods/flavors, beautifully presented. worth the $. i wish theyd do something (anything) about the noise, but would otherwise be happy to return., A rare night out was well spent at Kyirisan. Really enjoyed the tofu and scallops- especially the scallops! Everything that already been written about them is true. The thai chili cocktail was just the right bite, and not too sweet. I found the duck confit a little too bitter, and the watermelon salad had some mixed rating components, but looked so beautiful. Tremendous place for a date- very beautiful. Service was excellent!, My husband and I came last night to celebrate our anniversary and we had such a great time! I tried the dealers choice cocktail and had one of the most unique and tasty cocktails that Ive had in DC. I dont know why more restaurants dont do this. We started off with the tofu and the wings. I agree with some of the other commentors that the broth in the tofu dish was so delicious but that it would have been great to have some rice or something to soak it up with. The wings were far from your average bar chicken wing- perfect combination of salt/sweet/spice. We then had the short rib and the scallops. The short rib was fantastic and actually a lot more filling than it looked like it would be but the scallops were the star of the show. It might be one of the best dishes I have ever had- ever! Our service was great and our server brought us complimentary glasses of champagne because he knew we were celebrating. It was a really nice, thoughtful touch. We saw on the menu that you could buy the kitchen a round of shots or beers and we decided to repay the kindness. They insisted that we go in and join them and were delightfully surprised to see chef Ma there cooking. They all joined us for a shot. It was a memorable meal, made so by excellent service and fantastic food., My significant other read about a new restaurant on Washington Post and we were excited to try the Chinese/French menu.The decor was very modern and hip which fit with the hipster neighborhood of Shaw. The protruding gold colored triangles and the blue was a nice color scheme for the restaurant. The host and servers were friendly and well dressed. We ordered the deep fried tofu, sake brined watermelon, fried green tomatoes with radish cakes, sous vide duck confit, and the sesame ball with honey ricotta ice cream for dessert.The fried tofu was very soft lightly fried, the black pepper sauce was tasty, the pickled carrot complimented the tofu. The entire dish was very pleasant to eat because it was not greasy.The sake brined watermelon was quite interesting, the poached peach was hidden in the lettuce and tasted sweet, and the burrata cheese was the largest item on the dish. Wished there was more watermelon as the size of the cheese made me think the cheese was the main ingredient, not the watermelon as stated on the menu. The miso gochujang and the pine nut puree were nicely spotted on the plate. This plate was very pretty.Fried green tomatoes were served with a radish cake in the middle. On one side of the plate, there was a radish cake sandwich with fried green tomatoes as the bread on the outside but on the other side of the plate there was an open sandwich with one fried green tomato and one radish cake on top. Interesting how there were three fried green tomatoes and two radish cakes. Never thought these two could go so well together! The rabbit inside the radish cake was really good!Sous vide duck confit with carmelized brussels was delicious. The duck had a lot of flavor and was very tender; the brussels complimented the duck well. The apple cider gastrique was delicious. Sesame ball dessert with the ricotta ice cream was very pretty as well. The sesame ball was not the best but still decent. The ice cream melted very quick and we were not able to enjoy it. The mango sauce and the pineapple compote were nice but did not do much for the dessert; the mint leaves were a nice touch and refreshing.The restaurant staff was very attentive when we expressed our concerns. They took our comments seriously and we left as satisfied customers. We were impressed all the dishes were so nicely presented and cooked. All the plates, bowls, serving platters, etc. were all custom made! There were even guest books to write and doodle in. We will return again and look forward to trying other restaurants in the Tim Ma Restaurant Group!, The French, Chinese cuisine is what caught my eye. I looked through few reviews & pictures. Assuming they have seasonal dishes since some of the items I saw on here are no longer on their current menu.But we got the pan-seared scallops, freebird wings, black truffle congee, sous vide duck and chocolate mousse cake. Hands down ALWAYS order the pan-seared scallops. The scoop of ice cream adds that hint of sweetness & creaminess. The wings, tasted like any regular wings. There is the hint of the oyster sauce and spices from the chili paste. The congee, which I have been craving for, was a bit disappointing. Mainly from the fresh cut ginger they topped it off with that just overwhelmed the congee. The duck was good especially with the caramelized Brussels. Dessert was delicious, but I didnt really care for the cherry bourbon jam topped on the mousse cake.Overall service was excellent. I will definitely come back especially for the scallops!, Kyirisan won me over at 8:35pm, 5 minutes after our reservation time of 8:30pm since we had to wait to be seated. As a former hostess, I not one to make a fuss if we have to wait just a short time (like literally 5 minutes) but as an apology, they gave our party of 5 a free round of bubbles to sip while we waited. Talk about impressing us off the bat with awesome customer service. We were soon seated at a long booth and making the hard decision of what to get. Everything sounded more delicious than the next. So...what did we do? We ordered -almost- one of everything. Fried tofu, foraged mushrooms, wings, black truffle congee, sous vide duck confit, seared scallops over coconut risotto, beef something, soon appeared before us. The highlights for me were definitely the wings, the congee and the scallops over the risotto. Everything else was delightful as well but those stand out in my mind as ones I was reaching for a second and third spoonful. Desserts we had the newly launched bone marrow dessert which was a chocolate mousse and cherry based dessert. We also shared the sesame ball and the almond cake... none of which remained despite us all being ridiculously full.The dessert menu is presented as a notebook that previous guests write in or draw which was pretty fun.Our server was really busy but always kept an eye on our table. And when she was unavailable to accommodate us, another server or even the hostess made a stop to help refill a drink. We were also surprised with another round of gratis bubbly with dessert since we were celebrating a friend new job! Hooray for champs!The decor of the restaurant made me feel like I was sitting in a page from a West Elm catalog. That not really a complaint, since I LOVE West Elm. There just a fun, modern feel to it with geometric shapes, hanging light fixtures and succulent plants. All that being said, Kyirisan is a delightful addition to the Shaw area and I plan to return many, many times., Food was very good, but no value for your dollar. Expect to spend at least $200 for four people, Loved this place! Everything was awesome! We got the mushroom, scallops risotto, chicken wings, duck confit, and cheesecake. If I came back, I wouldnt order anything different!, I had an excellent time at Kyirisan last night and I highly recommend going! Service:We had excellent service all night long. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. She answered all of our questions and made sure we were taken care of. She checked in after each dish was delivered to see how we enjoyed everything. The staff at Kyirisan is very well trained... you can tell they are a well-oiled machine. Service was seamless. Fresh small plates arrived after every round of food plus fresh utensils. They anticipated our needs before we even knew we needed them. Dinner: Favorite dishes:1. Wings - While they were a bit small, the sauce is out of this world. Its not a standard buffalo sauce. Their sauce has a lot of depth and is very rich. The spice is incredibly flavorful and not overpowering. 2. Sous Vide Duck Confit - A close second... The portion of duck was very generous. The sauce was lightly sweet and had a bit of citrus in it. The brussels were cooked well and were the star this dish.3. Yellowtail a la Plancha - They were out of the Pompano and used yellowtail instead. Fish was yummy and the sauce it came with was amazing. Had a very subtle heat to it. We poured some of the sauce on the Duck Confit and it made the dish even better! Least favorite:1. Sake- Brined Watermelon - This item sounded really interesting but we just didnt understand it. There were a lot of different flavors and they were all a bit bland & underwhelming. We took a few bites and left it. Our waitress asked if we enjoyed it and offered to take it off the tab, but we told her its ok to keep it on as we did eat a good bit of it. When she delivered the bill, she told us she had the manager take it off anyways. Again - excellent service here. Drinks:Going to Rio - Had a nice spice to it and was lightly sweet. Quality ingredients in this cocktail. Ambiance: Maybe this was an accident, but they were playing 80s & 90s hip-hop the whole time we were there. At first, it wasnt noticeable but as the restaurant cleared out, you could hear it well. It was awesome! Again- cool staff, nice restaurant and excellent food. Will be back for sure., Virtually no vegetarian options. Dont be fooled by the tofu! Mindblowingly, its not vegetarian. And you wouldnt know this by looking at the menu. Unless theres a special that happens to be veg, you have all of ONE dish - the foraged mushrooms appetizer. That said, there was a special burrata the night we went and it was delicious. For that they get the extra star., Some of the food was really good but none of it was really impressive enough to justify the high prices for tiny portions. Well, maybe the scallops with coconut rice and ice cream were that impressive.The duck confit with brussels sprouts was good but not exciting. I enjoyed the tofu, but its just agedashi tofu with a spicier sauce and there were 6 tiny cubes of it. The biggest letdown was the special, a bit of thinly sliced raw salmon drenched in oil. The oil was supposedly infused with sichuan peppercorns, but I could not taste it., Unlike most, Kyirisans kitchen has a distinct personality, and it is worth going just to explore it. Often seductive, sometimes subtle, sometimes blunt, sometimes nuanced, its clear there is a world of thought behind what lands on the plate. Quality and intensity of flavor are what satisfy here, not quantity. The prices are high and the portions are relatively small, so plan to go on an evening when you are up for adventure and not merely seeking to blunt the tug of hunger. Theres something earthy and almost ancient about a number of the dishes. (I half expected to glance up at the kitchen and see sparks flying from a blacksmiths anvil or an alchemists flame.) Case in point; the tofu in black pepper sauce. The briny pool of sauce beneath the delicate cubes of perfectly encrusted, silky smooth, snow white tofu seemed like it could have bubbled up from a sacred pocket in the ocean floor hundreds of years ago, been captured in a seaweed pouch by a knowing mermaid, and handed up to a Japanese fisherman whose children and grandchildren have been carefully reducing and reconstituting it atop a wood stove in a tiny hut by the sea ever since. Its magical. An equal sense of time, place, and gravity anchor the duck confit to its stoneware plate. Paleo and low-carb dieters, welcome to heaven. Marvelous amounts of fat hold this disc of pleasure together, otherwise composed of savory, almost smoky pulled duck confit (prepared sous vide) and perfectly roasted quarters of Brussels sprouts that offer notes both cruciferously bitter and sweet. Citrus and caramel notes waft in and out with each bite. Though the dish appears achingly small when served, rich satisfaction results. Another shining star is the scallop dish described by many other reviewers. The spoonful of basil ice cream slowly melting into the coconut risotto evokes a step forward on the culinary timeline. The foraged mushrooms (cant you just see the little man in a pointed hat scurrying through the woods with his reed basket, stooping here and there?) were treated with integrity, the idea seeming to be to let them shine, which they did. Not as successful was the rockfish (sometimes pompano) dish with soybean chili paste. The bright, lively flesh of the fish was beaten and drowned by a brutishly heavy oil slick in the bottom third of the serving dish that was merely two-dimensional in flavor. Still, this dish had its place in the narrative coming from this kitchen.Of all things, the harshest note came from the sparkling water offered when youre seated. It seems they carbonate it on site using tap water. When youre leaning in to flavor the way this restaurant encourages you to, the chemical treatment of the local water strikes you harshly. A simple filter would fix this.Service was impeccable. Eat here and youll be thinking about your meal for days to come., This place is fantastic! We had the scallops, bone marrow, chicken wings, and duck confit, and loved every dish. Each dish was rich and had pretty interesting and unique flavors. The price was relatively high, but overall not bad given the quality. The space is modern and warm, with a lovely open kitchen. I would definitely come back!"
34|la-piquette-washington|I visited La Piquette last week. The food was simple, elegant, and packed with subtle, surprising flavors. I was thrilled particularly with the pork sausage, the salmon tartare, the pommes pailles, and the garbure - the menu looks like it will be changing frequently, depending on seasonal, local ingredients.  I was also very impressed with the wine program, which has been carefully curated. The atmosphere is elegant but relaxed. Staff was knowledgeable and professional. We heard a lot of French, which added to the authentic, not-trying-too-hard, French vibe of the restaurant. We will definitely be back, and I have a feeling this is going to become a neighborhood gem. For now, its the neighborhoods best-kept secret!, La Piquette fills the space left behind when Bistrot Le Zinc closed. The new restaurant looks and feels similar, but it is operated by the group that runs the nearby Bistrot Lepic. This new version occupies a great niche in the neighborhood. The service and staff were friendly and professional. The menu was an excellent bistro-variety of fish, meat, and traditional food (such as the cassoulet). Our grilled fish (pompano and monkfish) were perfect. The cocktails from the bar were excellent.Overall it was a great meal and great experience. Im tempted to give 5 stars, but La Piquette isnt quite Et Voila (my personal DC favorite)... close, but just not quite there yet. I am really glad to have them in the neighborhood and plan to frequently return. La Piquette is absolutely worth a visit, just leave a table for me., We visiited Saturday afternoon for lunch. The salmon and filet mignon dishes were excellent, although the filet mignon portion seemed incredibly small. The fries frites were really first rate. Both of our petit salads tasted overly salty. Service was a bit awkward - perhaps still working out opening kinks - just getting water or a wine menu or bread. The bread, by the way, was two small wafers sliced razor thin. And we never got to see the wine menu.And then the bill. Check yours. Ours had mistakes that took a while to remedy.Wel give them another shot when they have a bit more experience under their belt., My wife and I found ourselves with an open Saturday night this past week, and rather than sit at home with netflix and carryout, we decided to put on our pants and make the trek to Cathedral Heights to check out this quaint little french restaurant. Although La Piquette is not very convenient for metro riders, we were more than happy to go the extra mile to experience some of the finest authentic french cuisine this city has to offer.The atmosphere of La Piquette was quite pleasing - the wait staff was very warm and friendly, we were seated within minutes of arriving, and our charming waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the selection of wines and seasonal menu options. Many of the wait staff spoke french to one another which really added a nice touch to the ambience of the evening. If only there had been an accordion player in the background, I might have convinced my wife that we dont actually need to fly to Paris to experience a true francaphone romantic getaway!The food at La Piquette was nothing short of excellent. I opted for the braised beef (Beef Daube Provencal) while my wife chose the Mussels Mariniere. The entrees were prepared flawlessly and had tremendous flavor for dishes that are really quite subtle and elegant. The pommes frites side and Caesar salad were nothing to scoff at either. Caesar may not have been a frenchman, but La Piquettes chef certainly elevated this household salad to gourmet status.Im not much of a connoisseur when it comes to french wine, but I was very impressed by our waitresss recommended parings to go with our entrees. Clearly, La Piquette takes its cuisine and wine very seriously and it shows with their multitude of wine offerings to complement a seasonally changing food menu. Although the restaurant was only half full upon our arrival, it was really starting to heat up by the time we finished our last bite of Fondant au Chocolat - or the impossibly gooey and sumptuous chocolate cake we succumbed to ordering from the dessert menu. La Piquette was a great experience all around - our mouths, our heads and my wallet were quite impressed and I look forward to many more trips back to this Little Paris of Cathedral Heights!, Good, but not great.We ate on a busy Saturday night. It was a bit chaotic at the start, with a 10 minute wait past the reservation time. Still, the host was genial, the look and feel of the place is quite inviting, and there was a good buzz in the place.The menu is short but interesting. We had the foie gras, garbure, lump crab salad and mussels, which were all very good. So why 3 stars, not 5?First, the service is pretty uneven. Aside from the kerfuflfle on our arrival, one appetizer was nearly finished before the other arrived, water arrived well after wine, bread arrived halfway through the mains, water was never refilled. These could be teething problems and/or a busy Saturday night, but....its not 5 star.More importantly, the prices were rather high for what was delivered. The mussels were good, but the portion was considerably smaller than at other local places. The crab salad was lovely- but again very pricey for a rather small portion. As another reviewer has noted, you are issued one very thin slice of baguette - tucked into its own little paper bag. Overall, it was fine, but $100+ in a French bistro should not leave you feeling hungry., We had a fantastic dinner this past Friday night at La Piquette, it was my friends birthday so the 3 of us girls went for some small plates and wine, and wound up staying for dinner AND multiple desserts! What a treat! The staff was super attentive, and the manager even waited on us himself. Even when they were packed later in the evening we were still given great service. It was our first time there, well definitely be back again!, We had a lovely dinner here. The Garbure Soup as the Post promised was delicious, but everything about the meal was pleasant. The service. The generous taste of wine I received when I wasnt sure which one. The salmon tartare was very good too. Everyone agreed that the gateau a lorange was one of the best desserts theyd ever had. It is a little noisy, but it feels like celebration, not din., We love La Piquette! So excited it replaced the icky old Zinc. The food is delish, the atmosphere is nice, service is generally pretty good, sort of french-style depending on your waiter, if you know what I mean, but overall really great neighborhood bistro. We needed it up here desperately.The garbure is amazing, though the last time I had it it wasnt as good as the first few times; the cassoulet is great, esp the duck sausage; bread is perfect, always mean to ask if they make it themselves, though Im sure they dont (very surprised about the bread complaint in a previous review). The omelette I had at brunch a few weeks ago was honestly one of the best Ive ever had, though maybe Ive just gotten used to bad, greasy DC brunch. The vinaigrette used on the salads is also very good. Really cant complain about anything here. Definitely becoming regulars., We had the Maison salad, braised rabbit, and dessert. The food was wonderful, and I would have given this 5 of 5 stars, but the service was not great. The hostess only gives you a single menu, the other people in your group need to look up on a wall...meanwhile patrons beside you think you are glaring at them. The waiter was polite, but none of the surrounding tables got refills on their drinks. I had an empty glass that was never refilled after the appetizer round.Highly suggest they invest in more menus and a person to go around and refill drinks!, This charming and cozy bistro is a breathe of fresh Provencal air in a neighborhood of staid, uninspiring restaurants. The chef is not afraid to let the flavours of the ingredients speak out, yet balances them artfully to create harmony in each dish. Even the salads had their own distinctive voice; from my caesar with a clear anchovy flavor that highlighted, but did not overwhelm, the creamy dressing and sweet romaine, to my wifes salade maissone with its peppery chicory overtones. The garbure soup was a complex ensemble of duck, cabbage, beans and greens in a comforting stock that infused me with a sense of home and hearth on this bitterly cold day. The entrees did not disappoint, and continued the concert of bold, clear flavor tones. My beef daube had a rich savory sauce sweetened and fortified by red wine, and graced with young mushroom caps. The beef was tender and moist. My wifes natural chicken Americain was seasoned simply and cooked to a perfect golden brown: this bird didnt squawk, its taste sang. We finished with the warm apple tarte ala mode, which came out more apple than tarte (huzzah!), and was perfectly baked. The cinnamon and apples were equal partners in this confectionary marriage, and the dollop of ice cream surprised with its own unique flavor that turned the delightful duet into a tasty trio that was the perfect grace note to end our meal., We went to La Piquette last night and I would say that I was pleasantly surprised.Very good sweetbread, sald and soups. Our cassoulet was as good as you will find in DC.Short and well chosen wine list, we had a bottle of Faugeres at a reasonable price.We will go back very soon.Refreshing to have a nice authentic French bistrot in the area., I love the food at La Piquette. I have been there twice this week. The fish is perfectly cooked, the bread crusty and the dessert not too sweet. I want to go back every week from now on! The only reason why I did not give it five stars is the noise level: very energetic unless you go early or late (they close at 10pm most days, 10h30pm on Fridays and Saturdays, and at 9h30pm on Sundays.., I ate here two weeks ago and really liked this place. Its the neighborhood French Bistro I was looking for when I was in Paris last September. I had oysters from Washington state- small and very tasty with a glass of Chablis Premiere Cru - $15.00 bucks but totally worth it, sweetbread appetizer and the Rabbit entree, my friend had the pork cheeks it was all very good and tres authentique! (We washed it down with a bottle of amazing Bandol.) They even have a real french chef - not some egomaniac brat from CIA. I loved the waiters and the bus girl who was so attentive, they all were, really. This is a cozy neighborhood joint with good food and drink. and well worth a visit!, My husband and our friends dined at la piquette this evening and were absolutely charmed by the delicious food, excellent service and dynamic atmosphere. I felt just like I was in a Parisian bistrot! We were cordially greeted and seated by the maitre d whose professionalism and excellent knowledge of wine and food guided us and launched us into one of the tastiest and most excellent dinners out and about that we have ever experienced in DC. We especially appreciated the attentive detail to interior decorating and menu choices. Dcs best kept secret..., Had just returned to D.C. after a few years absence and checked out the new food scene. !4th has the action, but the price points and the crowds were shrill. La Piquette fills the bill of a great neighborhood restaurant. Authentic and creative options, at fair prices with a friendly wait staff. The magic is the offerings that are generally missing elsewhere. Ate there two successive nights 4/9 4/10 and had rabbit, tripes (divine) frog legs, and duck rilletes. Great desserts,and affordable wine make this a go to spot. Will return., I love la Piquette! Ive been for dinner during the week and on the weekend. Ive been for lunch and Ive been for brunch. There are always new menu items to choose from, and its always the freshest ingredients of the season. The ambience is relaxed and friendly and there is always an animated crowd. It is French. They dont rush. The servers engage in conversation with you. You wont be force fed and in and out in 90 minutes. If thats what you want, go across the street for the Mexican factory. Come to la piquette if you want divine charcuterie, pate, roasted beet and leek salad, delicious sole meuni38re, mussels and out of this world frites, rabbit, daube or lamb. It is an exceptional addition to the neighborhood! Merci beaucoup La Piquette, for many wonderful dining experiences! I will be back!, Tonight I had the worst steak frites I have ever had, in France, the US or elsewhere. The quality of the meat was terrible. But the fries were fine. And the house wine was disgusting., im not a foodie, so my opinion is probably of no value to 95% of dc. but i AM french, and i know a good steak frites when i taste one.its not even just about the steak frites. every single thing i ate was wonderful.the bread they give you while you wait is addictive. we asked for more three times. im kind of a butter hater, so i didnt mind, but i was surprised to see the bread served with olive oil instead of butter. (i was pleased!)the roasted beet salad was incredible. the steak frites, well... i stopped eating meat several years ago and i dont miss it. but i saw someone else order the steak frites and it looked so good that i couldnt resist ordering it too. it was delicious, the fries were perfect and the roasted tomato with pesto that was served on the side was an interesting addition. not a crumb was left on the plate.had a couple glasses of very good ros39, cant remember the name though.for dessert i had the apple tart, which was out of this world. and the chef brought out some calamansi sorbet for us to taste. it was really good, and i plan on ordering that next time.the service was top notch and the atmosphere pleasant.cant wait to go back., We had lunch on a Friday afternoon at la Piquette recently. The food was was very well prepared and delicious, but the service was below average: had only been seated for less than five minutes when we were asked if we were ready to order, our wine forgotten until we reminded the waiter when our appetizers were served, and a wait of over twenty minutes to be served dessert and a coffee, and then only after the waiter was reminded. We enjoy leisurely lunches, but an hour and a half at the table after traveling from Annapolis through DC traffic was a bit much considering we felt almost ignored once our main course was in front of us. We left the smallest tip weve given in years. Not sure wed go back a second time., Gave La P. another try, this time for lunch. Our party of three had the same waiter as before, and he was much better - he didn ignore us. Service was still off, however - the bread arrived after 30 mins, although we were psyched that it was hot. The waiter noticed my near empty water glass and said he fill it - half an hour later the busboy did so. And it was deja vu about the flourless chocolate cake. Same exact scenario - after waiting 20 mins to order dessert, the waiter says it takes 20 mins and like last time, we couldn wait that long. But what really takes the cake - in a bad way - is that I ordered the salmon with garlic spinach & mashed potatoes. Asking what was in the sauce, I had pointed to the item on the menu when ordering. What arrived was salmon with fries and a salad. I asked about it right away and THREE different people came over to talk to us about it. The first guy went off to inquire, and came back to say the mashed potatoes were spoiled. I asked about the garlic spinach, which I was really looking forward to ... The second person asked who gave us the menu (the MANAGER) and said it was a dinner item. I replied that they given me a menu and I just wanted what I ordered ... So the manager came over and says, let me explain what happened. No apology, just more hassle. Wee trying to have a nice lunch here, after all. I had it and replied that I didn want to talk about it any more. Our meal had been ruined with the inept and awkward handling of what really should and could have been dealt with more professionally. I was mortified and felt embarrassed that a simple and pleasant request for what I ordered had been made into a federal case. Thanks, guys. Eventually the first guy brought a delicious plate of garlic spinach. Had they done so without the rigamarole, or at least just done their best without giving me the third degree, I would have been happy.For this restaurant that been open 6 months, with numerous Yelp comments re: poor service, and owned by the owner of Bistro Lepic, here my suggestion: if you give someone a menu and they show you the menu item as they order, bring it to them. Mistakes are bound to happen from time to time, but when you mess up, apologize and deal with it gracefully. DON put the customer through the third degree. Almost forgot - the manager said he charge for the lunch item . Gee, thanks for not overcharging. Most restaurants try to make you happy when they mess up by offering a dessert on the house, or some small token. Not La Piquette. I not inclined to give it another try. Very frustrating - I would have liked to be regular since I live nearby., Great neighborhood bistro! Food fantastic, service superb! I especially like the steak frites!, A very charming bustling neighborhood bistro; but I think success has not helped it On our last visit - we waited 30 minutes for someone to take our order ( we had reservations) another 30 minutes for appetizers to arriveAnd then the waiter brought one wrong entreeMaybe ( hopefully) it was an off nightThe dishes were still great, One of my favorite hidden gems - the bread is amazing...like youre in France! The calamari is NOT breaded and the best I have ever had! The chocolate mousse desert is heavenly too!!!, One of my favorite spots in DC. Excellent food, wine, and service every time! Highly recommend!, This is the crown jewel of French Bistro cooking in DC. The Chef/Owner Francis Layrle works over every authentic detail of this bistrot. Make time to enjoy your meal. Let your mind take you away like you are eating in France. Order your French food memories and you will be transported by the food and hospitality of food and staff. La Piquette needs to be on your DC area foodie bucket list!, Worth making a special trip to the neighborhood for this restaurant. Consistently great, interesting food. Everything that Ive had there in my few visits has been excellent. Atmosphere is lovely and the upper bar area is a good place for appetizers and drinks. Its hard not to fill up on bread before the meal comes since the bread is simply divine, but try to save room for dessert. Good place to take friends to show them what cool stuff there is in Cathedral Heights., There are so many great restaurants in the Cathedral Heights area now that La Piquette cant afford to be overpriced with mediocre service.I gave this place a second chance after a so-so experience the first time. Unfortunately, I left feeling that I had definitely overpaid for the food my wife and I received. For example, the mussel soup doesnt have mussels in it...go figure. The service was not up to par either. Nobody asked us how our meal was and nobody asked if we wanted another drink (we did)., This place is excellent and a great neighborhood joint. The food never disappoints. We love the mussel and saffron soup, and the duck lorange. The creme br3bl39e is very nice too. We went for my husbands birthday and we will definitely be back. The food is better than some of the other hip French bistro places in town. I almost didnt want to write the review because I want to keep it a secret, but really, this place is a hidden gem in a neighborhood that is developing with new restaurants pretty quickly., I had a fantastic salmon dinner at La Piquette. Chef de cuisine Francis orders it fresh from Denmark I believe. Chef Oscar made my meal -- salmon over spinach with pommes de terre pur39e, though I substituted the potatoes with perfectly cooked haricots verts. It was a meal I could have eaten in my hometown San Francisco, or in France where fish is almost always moelleux like butter. The apple tart was on an equally high standard -- paper thin slices of apple on the most delicate of crusts with a small scoop of deliciously unacidic kalamanzi sorbet., A quaint neighborhood french restaurant that hits quite above its status. The technical prowess of the kitchen is prodigious. The petit plaques (small dish) are a great way to mix a variety of the excellent fares without going overboard. The fish fares are quite good but for me, the game fares like the rabbit or venison are the personal favorites. Ive had luck getting consistently good service sitting at the bar. If you live nearby, this should be on your regular dining pick., This was a great experience. First, after 7pm you can park at the Giant and they will validate. They have a changing menu so if you want something check and see ahead if its on the menu. I wanted escargot, settled for sea urchin. All good. The menu was good, the sauteed mushrooms were amazing. The pork belly not so much. It was breaded and fried and just wasnt what I wanted. The service was excellent. I cant remember her name, but she was France. Highly recommend it., Tried LP for #RWDMV.Reason(s) why I chose La Piquette: 1) I heart french bistros; 2) Their resto week menu had a lot of offerings; and 3) Any mention of Daniel Boulud influence and Im sure to try it. This is Chef Layrles second restaurant in DC. His first is Bistro LEpic which I have yet to try. LP is the casual sister resto of BLE.By the time our 8:30pm reservation rolled around, they were sadly out of the black bass and Wellfleet oysters so I will have to defer trying those items another time.We ordered the following:Apps - *1. Cod Croquette - a play on fish and chips, but with a meaty helping of a croquette w/ tartar sauce + salad greens2. Assiette de Jambon de Bayonne - bayonne ham, fried pork belly, and cornichons over salad greens 3. Moules Frites - mussels + shoestring fries Entrees - 1. 8 oz. Steak Frites - baseball steak cut and cooked to perfection (medium rare), shallots, red wine reduction, pomme paille + shoestring fries*2. Lapin en Gibelotte - fall-off-the-bone braised rabbit, Sauvignon Blanc, linguini, light cream and basilDessert - 1. Mango Sorbet2. G32teau 30 lOrange*Must-Try/Have: 1. Their complimentary house-made bread is bomb -- crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. They serve it in a nice crisp brown bag w/ olive oil for dipping.2. Their frites are seriously addicting! I think they flash-fry them.3. I really enjoyed the rabbit pasta dish. It was well-balanced in flavor and the portion of the linguine was just enough not taking away from the light cream sauce or the tender rabbit. YUMBOREE! I was genuinely satisfied with the overall quality, authenticity, and portion of the food. I also preferred the more casual ambience. Service was a bit slow between courses hence why I docked 1 star, but it didnt ruin our overall dining experience. I would still like to come back and try the black bass since thats apparently their star dish.Tips:1. LP is directly across from 2 Amys. They validate parking if you park in the shopping center garage around the corner where the Giant is located.2. Every single table was full during our visit. The tables are a bit close together, but that is part of the charm in my opinion. If thats not your cup of tea, I would opt to be seated by the bar where the tables provide more elbow room OR youll just have to hope the tables convo next to you doesnt overpower yours., Atop all the hype and the steady stream of weekend diners packing the place full for months, and having been a regular at the irresistibly-charming sister venue, Bistrot Lepic, for years, my expectations for La Piquette were understandably high. And easily met.Situated in that hot new epicenter between Cathedral Heights and Cleveland Park, La Piquettes cozy split-level bar and dining room are tucked discreetly on the south side of Macomb just off Wisconsin Ave.Start with wine, choosing from what is easily one of the best assortments of offerings by the glass in the city right now. The Pays DOc pinot noir is mellow and rounded; the perfect opener if you dont know what youre going to have for dinner. I cant wait to go back and try the Lalande de Pomerol, a Bordeaux Ive never tried. Options multiply if youre going by the bottle, including three different Sancerre!Its hard to go wrong with the combination charcuterie and cheese plate to whet your appetite for the finely crafted main dishes. I loved the delicious sauce smothering the braised rabbit pasta that other Yelpers have raved about. More recently, I was also pleasantly surprised by the flavorful-but-not-too-briney deliciousness of the moules mariniere. (How rare is it to find a place in NW with really fresh mussels?)What really captures the romantic bistrot experience here are the details: the mounted-cork art pieces; the high-top tables at the cozy bar area where you want to just lounge all evening with your laptop; the intimate spacing of the two-seat tables in the main dining room. Its what made one of my early dinner dates with my girlfriend such an enchanting one here. Its also whatll make La Piquette a go-to standard on your list for years to come., *****Restaurant Week Dinner Review*****My friend and I chose La Piquette mainly based on its location. Also, thanks to Jason R. I knew I could park in the garage where the Giant is and La Piquette validates after 7:00pm. Free parking in DC, WooHoo!My friend arrived before me, so the host escorted me to the way, way back of the restaurant. Therefore, I can comment on the ambience of the petite restaurant because I had my back to it, and we were seated at a table smack next to the swinging door to the kitchen. If I return, I will make sure to be seated at a more central location. I guess having a reservation didn mean much. The food was very good. We both opted for the $35 RW menu, and we both started with escargot. This is not your typical snails in garlicky butter variety. It was quite spicy. Hard to describe, and my pic doesn quite show it too well. Save some of their delicious French bread for dipping into the sauce the snails come in. For my entr39e I had the mushroom risotto. It had a mix of wild mushrooms; hen of the woods is my most favorite mushroom of all. It was very creamy and delicious. My pal had the baseball cut steak frites. My Languedoc red wine ($10) was a great pairing. For dessert I chose their gateau a lrange. A very simple, yet comforting cake. I liked the brand of tea (Palais des Thes) they serve. Overall, a great meal and solid service. Just don let them seat you at the back table., We have finally found the French bistro we have been seeking in the DC area. After several disappointments elsewhere, Piquette more than lived up to our (admittedly high as we have spent considerable time in France) expectations at dinner yesterday--a little bit of France just off Connecticut Avenue. Comfortable and convivial, Piquette provides a good environment for an enjoyable meal. The food was exceptional: our meal included a cassoulet to die for, a fine cod dish, and a truly tasty apple tart. The best single item we ordered was the salad composee including a sampling of a lentil and a couscous salad that were in themselves worth our trip into the city. There is a good wine list, and the menu is replete with items that look to be worth additional visits. We can hardly wait for our next opportunity to eat there!, My second experience compared to the first one was way better; I went there with two of my friends on a Thursday night for a drink at the bar and everything was really good. They have wine options on tap which is a new concept for me, and a selection of French liquor that you can enjoy. I tried their cauliflower soup and it was delicious. The complimentary warm crispy bread is delicious. I will go back to have a full meal next time., Wonderful small neighborhood restaurant... The food and service are both impeccable... Highly recommend and check out the patio on nice evenings., We live in the neighborhood so thought we give it a try. Fri night, 7:00 pm. Food was good - vegetable appetizers and fish dishes were fine. Service was indifferent, if not outright cold. There was no host when we entered (why? Even IHOP and Dennie greet you). After a min-two one of the waiters noticed us standing there so came over. I pointed out our name on their reservation list. He shrugged, looked around, and offered us a table at the door, which we declined for obvious reasons. He then put us in the train against the wall, crammed between another table for two and a table of four with their backs to us - the latter so close that the dandruff from the female customer hair cascaded into my wife water glass with every giggly look-around (who noticing me?) and head toss. (Side note: While this was not the restaurant fault, from this table loud, affected conversation, which we tried but failed to avoid overhearing, they seemed to be some type of status-whoring local media lefties Meet the Press! I still had my makeup on haha!; DC really is Hollywood for ugly people.) This place is very noisy (worsened for us by the MtP apparatchiks). The tables are too densely packed (fire hazard?) - Youe sharing too much personal space - talk, fragrance, assumed intimacy - with those around you. The waiter (Juan) tried but seemed overworked and didn offer any personalized service. The poor bread girl was just a zombie. Sum: decent food, prices avg for this type of place, indifferent service, invisible management, cramped, stuffed-up atmosphere, and rock-concert noise level. Cactus Cantina looking better all the time., Absolutely ADORE this place. Food is outstanding. Service is too. Chef/Owner and Maitred are so charming. EVERYTHING ON THE MENU is off-the-charts delectable. Have been back a couple of times and cannot wait to return, CROQUE MADAME (5 NOMs)The closes you can get to an authentic Croque Madame from a small French bistro near National Cathedral. There maybe many restaurants that serve this dish, but none does it so well, so be prepared to get your taste buds wowed away. This is by far probably one of the most beautiful looking dishes weve had in a while. Just love the amount of gruyere cheese in it, overflowing form all sides under the thick toast. Its not just any ham and instead they use Jambon de Paris that was cooked to specific French recipe. Of course its not complete until there is a beautiful bright yellow sunny side up egg on top with perfect runny yolk. As you slice into it with a knife all the gooey things mix together and yolk covers the whole thing. Together all this creates one of the most impressive breakfast dishes. Combination of strong cheese and ham flavors with a crunchy toast. Unlike other dishes, this massive sandwich is only $14 which makes it an excellent order. This is a very popular order available for both dinner and brunch. They only make a finite number of them a day and tent to run out pretty fast, so make sure to order yours early.BEEF TARTAR (3 NOMs)The only french way to start the brunch is with some fancy meat. At the cute place where all waiters speak with sexy French accent we are starting our Sunday foodie experience with some raw meat dish. Whaa raw meat? You heard it right we are eating hand cut beef tenderloin season and served uncooked. Ah our favorite part of this dish were really the fries. So thin and crunchy, no need for a any condemns. Goes great with the tartar. Not exactly an overly crazy concept for those of us who love sushi. So live adventures and try something new. Light soft dish that went great with a side of thin fries and salad. Pretty nice dish, but $16 is a bit too much for it. Might leave you craving more. Not their star dish, but the rest of the food is way better so dont let this judge the whole place.Check out my blog for more fun reviews and pictures, link in the bio., What a fabulous meal! Every time I am visiting DC and in the area my family and I always enjoy a great dinner at this place., I can say that Ive never eaten at this restaurant, but I can tell you that I never will either. I tried to take my girlfriend and her daughter there on Saturday evening. We walked I. Without a reservation shortly after 7. There were 15 open tables, and no one waiting. The host, some pretentious Frenchman w an earring in each ear (just for identification purposes) told us that the wait was 2 hours and that all the empty tables were reserved. I asked him how long he waited to hold tables for people who didnt show up. He said 15 minutes. We came back 15 minutes later and saw that there were still at least 10 of the same tables open. The host then told us that it would take another 15 minutes for him to seat us. Thats just crappy service and lousy customer service. I wouldnt eat there if they gave the food away for free. If I could give this place 0 stars I would., Really, really good, from appetizer through dessert-- especially the orange cake. And nice and low key as well. Enjoy a great meal without the pretentiousness of some DC restaurants., Food was delicious! Unlike other reviewers we had an attentive server. Only problem was the entrees took a very long time to come out- probably kitchen backup since it was a Saturday night. Its also a little pricey. But I would recommend this place to a friend and go back!, Pas mal. Had the Pan Seared Foie Gras -- which I thought would be pat39. Mas non! It was literally grilled duck fat. I guess I missed the quotes around foie gras. Was it worth $18? Not really since my friend had the roasted duck breast which had some fat which he trimmed. I literally could have taken that home and grilled it myself. But would it have the yummy toasted bread, roasted apples, and port reduction? Absolument pas. So, maybe worth $11.38., I trained as a chef when I was a young man, and I am naturally a bit picky when I eat out. I had heard good things about La Piquette, so I made reservations to have my birthday brunch there. The food, ambience, and service all exceeded my expectations - this restaurant would be considered top notch even in Paris. The chef, Mr. Francis Layrle, is absolutely an artist. There were four of us today, and we all were blown away by the food. My daughter and I started with the soft shell crabs - excellent, delicate, perfectly crisp on the outside and moist and flaky on the inside. I also had sweetbreads - again, perfect. For our entrees my daughter ordered the bass, I had the Cod cheeks, and my friend and his wife had short ribs and the soft shell crabs. Sides of scallops, as well as French shaved ham also appeared - we spent most of the brunch talking about how incredible the food was. Desserts were just as good. This will be our new go to favorite French restaurant from now on., I went back to la Piquette last week with two of my friends and again loved it. The service and the food were outstanding specially our conversation with chef Francis about desserts. The whole experience was great.I will recommend this French bistro to al my friends., For a romantic evening out, its hard to beat this sweet little spot. This French restaurant is a year year old, and has all the charm of a Parisian bistro. I love steak tartare, so I tried that for the appetizer at $16. It was divine. Healthy portion and really one of the best that Ive had.The skate wing, accompanied with a large spinach salad, was cooked to perfection with butter and capers.My wife had a grilled fish which she thought was yummy but not anything spectacular.Half a carafe of the eminently drinkable house red.For dessert we ordered the cr38me br3bl39e, which was larger size than what I am used to. It was simple and yummy..The entire evening out cost about $120. But for a special evening, it was worth it., This is an amazing place. The food is amazing I suggest making a reservation if you want to go for Sunday brunch. The mimosas are great! The croissants are fresh flaky like a delicious experience especially with jam., My wedding reception was held at La Piquette in April 2016. It couldnt have been a more perfect experience. Amazing ambience, delicious food, attentive and kind staff. This night was as much if not more special to me than my Georgetown wedding the following day. I cant recommend La Piquette enough as a location for a special event. Thank you, La Piquette, for a memorable and special night!, Visited Tuesday evening. My date had some sort of appetizer that consisted of several different spoonfuls of different dips which he put onto the bread provided with a knife. Clearly my date, who is a telecommunications engineer at the Educational Testing Service and who cleans other peoples sailboats on the weekend, had never eaten in a French restaurant before. Could not figure out what it was. It had avocado slices on the plate. I ordered the Salade Ni37oise $16Grilled Salmon, Peppers, Potatoes, Green Bean, Tomatoes, the saffron soup(saffron in warm water with mussels), and Grilled Black Seabass $32that came with Ratatouille and Crushed Potatoes. Could not figure out where the Ratatouille and Crushed Potatoes were on the plate. I also ordered the French red wine that was on the table which was very good. Waiter completely forgot about the Salade Ni37oise order. End of review., Great spot with great french food. I had the rabbit and it was delicious. The server was very accommodating with my limited wine knowledge. The dining area was a little small and could be noisy at times. This would be a good place for a date., There were three people in our party. I think we all agreed the atmosphere was great. Its busy and vibrant. Theres outdoor seating and the window rolls up. Just a nice general feel and great for people watching. The food was good but not great. No one had any major complaints but, for the price, we expected more (both quality and quantity). With so many options in DC I doubt well be back. Glad we gave it a shot though., Wow... What a disappointment. To start off, the place is a cute restaurant with friendly people but its seriously unfortunate thats all I can say about this place. My dinner companion and I arrived around 7pm. Out of all of the tables that were completely available, they sat us next to a couple (you can tell they were wondering the same as us) We could not converse so well without worrying whether we were speaking too loud or whatever. It was awkward being so close to this other table for both of us, but alas we continued our evening. We had ordered the Steak Frites and a shrimp dish. We literally waited an hour!! While other diners were being seated, even they received their dishes before we did! Id have to say we did our very best to keep our composure but this was just ridiculous, no updates or apologizes. Only until my friend looked incredibly angry (HANGRY to be honest) did the server then come over and said it would be out soon. Whats soon?!? Its been an hour! The dishes came out and looked so mediocre and the small shrimp dish, made us question hard why did it take so long. Like I said, no apologizes or at least an offer for free desert. Nothing. The steak was so incredibly dry, no flavor and the fries taste like old fries. The shrimp was all that tasted okay but nothing we would wait an hour for. We are all for second chances but not any time soon., If you recognize energy, passion, fun and the natural mastery of simplicity from a great personality and creative chef then treat yourself and others to a refreshing experience that will make you feel like youre visiting the perfect place to dine -the very one that youve been looking for in all your travels with great dishes, fun personality and masterly talent that revives your senses. Congratulations to Francis - he is a gem in our back yard., This restaurant reminds me of France (without the attitude)Everything is fabulous from salads to dessertsOpen all day with a few tables outsideSuper brunch prix fixe
35|le-diplomate-washington|My partner and I went for the first night of the public soft opening (4/7/13). We were in the back area, which opened onto the patio on a beautiful evening. The sound levels are probably a bit higher in the main dining room.My meal - Romarin: cocktail of Absolut, St. Germain, lemon, and grapefruit section (delicious!)Onion Soup Gratinee: omg. I love it. It better than mine, and mine is really good. Deep, rich-flavored broth, some brandy, some strong cheese. It weird to obsess about the soup since it supposed to be easy, but Ie had some really insipid versions over the years.House white wineBreads: wheat/rye, baguette, walnut/cherry, whipped butter. Best Ie had in an American restaurant in a long time.Beef Stroganoff: creamy, a bit tart, good mushrooms, beef that was almost sweet and melty. Nice, yellowy homemade noodles and a proper portion size.Calvados for dessertMy partner meal - Roland Garos cocktail: not sure, but he liked itCountry duck terrine: really good pate (not all liver), the coulis on the side was really nice on it, closest thing to a complaint all meal on his salad leaf, the dressing was good but a little strongHouse whiteLamb shank with cous cousApple tarte tatin with excellent vanilla ice cream, also a quenelle of whipped cream that seemed to have have sour cream in it as wellCoffeeAll in all, amazing. Loved it. They need to hammer out some pacing issues (entrees were slow to come out and we needed to wait on some silverware before we could eat our dessert). The food and attitude of the service were impeccable. We are thrilled to have it in the neighborhood. I looked around, and everyone was smiling. We congratulated Jason, the AGM who stopped by our table. I think it going to be very popular., The excitement among 14th Street trendy folk over the arrival of a trendy restaurant was palpable. I decided to go to the soft opening this week because of the 10% discount and I wanted to be the first to review (...but there are dreams that cannot be...). It pretty awe inspiring that the design and contruction teams were able to turn this space around in such a short amount of time. The garden on the roof, the vintage bar, the green-tile-room-thing all make the old abandoned laundromat a distant memory. It totally motivates me to completely renovate my entire apartment, or like, clean my room and empty the dishwasher. One gripe: Why didn they make the patio level? I have PTSD from watching all the martini/wine glasses standing at five degree angles on the outdoor tables (...and there are storms we cannot weather...).The food was solid, but generally heavy and pricey. I mean, French food is always pretty cumbersome but I felt pretty damn encumbered, physically and financially, walking out of the restaurant. Hook a brother up with a lemon on top of that veal with cream sauce. (I want royalties if that suggestion is actually implemented). The steak tartare needed some more flavor and the duck breast was ~way~ past medium rare. But I doubt these problems will persist into the second/third week. And I very interested to see if their brunch/lunch menus will offer some simpler fare and lower price points.Service was earnest, albeit awkward, like nobody knows yet where the line is drawn between personality and politeness. But I enjoyed that because it seemed like the waiters were afraid of me and I relish power. Bring me more bread, slave. The bread is really good., Im not one to easily impress at restaurants. I tend to stick to familiar foods and loathe it when it gets too loud and I cant hear myself talk to my dinner guest. I have visited Le Diplomate twice in its first week of opening for several reasons: The decor is to die for. They took an old coin laundry and transformed it into a hip, stylish, comfortable bistor. The service reminds me that some establishments still care. From the first moment you step near the restaurant, you are warmly greeted. If you have to wait, they make it easy with a text message alert so you can do other shopping or grab a drink at the bar. Everyone is pleasant and truly wants you to know you have made the right choice to come. As a non-adventuresome eater, the menu BEGS you to try new things. The descriptions dont do the food justice, and the unique blend of drinks and fine wines will make any foodie a happy camper.We ate both inside and out, and both were delightful experiences.This is definitely on top of my DC list as a new fav. You wont be sorry for going there, but I will be, because my wait is BOUND to be longer once word gets out about this new gem on 14th Street., As a former resident of Philadelphia and huge fan of any Starr restaurant, Le Diplomate surpasses any expectation I had. From the decor to the service to the food, everything was fantastic. (And a much needed trip down memory lane!) Its been open for only a week, and Ive been there twice already (and plan on going again real soon)! I highly recommend the steak tartar, the roasted beet and carrot salad, the scallops, salmon, and the good old fashioned burger! Prices are what you would expect for DC yet remaining affordable/reasonable. Please, go and enjoy! With the nice weather now upon us, the large outdoor seating area will be perfect., We were there on the monday after their soft open and while the timing of the food was a bit uneven (fries were a tad cold) this place is excellent. Two steps above basic bistro food, terrific attentive service, high quality food. Pricey but a high quality product. The duck pate, the lobster risotto were all great and the bread is all made in house and terrific. Give the, a few weeks to get running on all cylinders and go. Corporate owned, if that matters to you., Breaking my Yelp silence to give this place a resoundingly positive review. First of all, they spared no expense with the interior renovation of this former shirt laundry. Secondly, the place this extremely true to the European bistro style while also accounting for the American desire for a large and lubricated late-morning meal. Third, they are super nice - it was a special occasion and the hostess staff took great care of us. Finally, the food and drinks were fantastic. All in all, we will be back (and soon)., Awesome. One word to describe this placeWe went for their first brunch service during the soft open period. I had to get a reservation a week in advance and it worked like a charm. We all got there at our reservation time but the place was packed to the brim. The kind hostess said it would take about 10 minutes for our table to be set up and her timing was right on point. The waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly and provided exceptional service. We ordered the seafood tower to share between 6 as our appetizer and it was great. Now, the bad part that was rectified very well. Our brunch entrees took over an hour after the appetizers were served. The waiter apologized profusely. At one point we had 2 different managers approach us and apologized for the delay. Since this was a soft opening serving their first brunch, we knew there were going to be some hiccups along the way. We were not upset or even bothered, thanks mainly to the kind waiter and sincere apologies from management. At one point we emphasized that we were ok with the delay but the manager admitted to be embarrassed by the situation and would make things right. We expected maybe for our drinks to be comped.Here is the best part - they comped the entire food bill. All they charged us was for the drinks. Our initial bill for 6 people was over $300. We ended up paying less than a third of that. We were pleasantly surprised at how much they comped our tab. Before we left, 3 more managers showed up to apologize and we said their exceptional service more than made up for it. One more thing. Food is exceptional. We all ordered different things, and each of our entree was delightful., To begin at the end...Yes, the mussels were slightly oversteamed, and yes, the Meyer lemon was a bit too aggressive for me, but the moules marinieres at Le Diplomate was still one of the finest preparations of this dish I have found in Washington. When we visited for a leisurely soft-opening brunch on Sunday, the rich, wine-laced broth had a lofty mouthfeel, as though the butter had been emulsified, and the mussels were plump and deliciously sweet. A nest of fresh herbs added a beautiful bouquet to the dish, and we couldnt resist dipping the crusty baguette, crostini, and substantial slices of crusty wheat/rye bread into the large bowl to capture every decadent trace of broth. Before that, we enjoyed the escargots bathed in butter with hazelnuts, leeks, and a touch of garlic, an incredibly rich dish of perfectly firm snails (not still in their shells, sadly) whose earthiness was nicely accented by the nuts. This dish was served in a deceptively small ramekin with crostini, and easily satisfied both of us. The cheese plate started our meal with a beautiful selection of alternately buttery, nutty, and bitter soft and semi-firm cheeses at the peak of freshness, including Pont LEveque, Fourme dAmbert, Morbier, Bucheron, and Epoisses, accompanied by fanned slices of Granny Smith apple, fig jam, macerated cherries, and almonds. Brilliantly hued Kir Royale cocktails stayed in our hands throughout the afternoon, delicately sweet and garnished with a large flake of lemon rind that delighted our noses with each sip.As you may expect from a Stephen Starr restaurant, every aspect of Le Diplomate reflected the owners unwavering point of view and incredible ability to ensure that things were meticulously executed by every person involved in the production. Even with the expected soft-opening hiccups (dishes and cocktails that took a few extra minutes to arrive, the slightly overdone mussels, a hilarious incident when our waiter furtively consulted his cheat sheet listing the cheese plate selections, a touch of confusion about the last seating for brunch), our entire experience was lovely. Surprisingly, the interiors natural lighting, wood paneling, blinds, light fixtures, and wicker furniture evoked thoughts of a group of privates taking an afternoon off to enjoy wine and a hearty meal in the 1900s. Though it did not present a soul-quaking challenge to the mind or palate, Le Diplomate beautifully fulfilled our expectations.And yes, Stephen Starr was present at his newest restaurant., Hailing from New York, I was pretty at home on Le Diplomates 14th street facing sidewalk patio on Sunday. The sprawling restaurant and ample outdoor seating is going to be a huge hit in this beyond up-and-coming manicured, fashionable, gay neighborhood. Im a fan. The baked-in-house pastries were lovely, and the oysters were on point. Fries were good, mayo could have had more citrus and/or salt to make it truly good. Also the mussels were of good quality, but the white wine broth left something to be desired. I have no doubt Le Diplomate will continue to impress--namely because in our leisurely sit outside with our dog, the manager came by multiple times and our waiter and busboy were never absent. Service and level of care were impeccable--and Im comparing to NYC standards (not easily romanced by DCs restaurant scene). Maybe it was the sunny day and rose, but I cant wait to come back. Oh--and speaking of rose--the cote de Provence and the Sancerre could be improved upon as well. Keep it up!!, Bonjour le Diplomate! Another French place in DC...mais oui! But this place gets it oh so right. Decor & ambiance are stellar: everything from the lighting fixtures in the main room, bar stools, Ricard tables outside, the crochet curtains, and the tiny tile floor and crappy soap dispenser in the ladies room scream vintage Paris. Loved soaking it in. Food: Awesome - had the boudin noir(blood sausage) which was perfectly well seasoned and executed perfectly and for dessert, a napoleon - served with dark chocolate ice cream and just enough caramel sauce that you almost consider picking the plate up and licking it in mixed company. yep, its that good. Service is very good but be warned - its not a cheap eat here - but for the entire experience I would come again. RECOMMEND. fyi-you can book on opentable and call in reservations, and given how popular this place is - do it! Try one of the cute booths in the main room if you can swing it., Jaime Le Diplomate.I went to Le Diplomate for dinner this past week during its soft opening and it was simply splendid. It was quite crowded during the soft opening, which was to be expected with all the hype around its impending opening. It was well worth the hour wait to be seated without a reservation. They are nifty in that the restaurant texts you when your table is ready. This is much preferred to a vibrating buzzer because it allowed me to make better use of my time (and to go shopping at Buffalo Exchange). Le Diplomate has a beautiful interior that uses its space tremendously and serves food that charms your pants off.We started off what would be an excellent meal with a bottle of white wine and the Mushroom Tart. The mushroom tart was so tasty that if it were slightly larger I could have been satisfied with it being my whole meal.For dinner, we had the Moules Frites and the Veal Escalope. The moules frites was mussels served with fries. As good as the overall meal was the mussels were good but not the best part of the meal. The star was truly the fries and the broth of the mussels. The mussels could have been cooked a little less. Hopefully, this is a kink the restaurant worked out during its soft opening. The Veal Escalope, which is braised ramps topped with a morel cream and served with asparagus, was spot on and was so good it is going to be hard not to get this on my return visit to Le Diplomate.It is by far the most welcome addition to the restaurant scene the Logan Circle area has seen in quite some time. Absolutely fantastic. I will be a repeat customer and in fact, I already have my reservation set., When we arrived we were both amazed how huge this restaurant was it occupied the whole corner block of Q St. The outdoor seating reminded me of Paris. Walking in we were also impressed with the grand bar, high ceiling and old French windows. We were seated near the bar area it was a good view of whats going on in the restaurant. We started with two glasses of ros39 - I couldnt believe I started liking ros39 but after being in South of France I couldnt help it. It was a nice dry medium bodied ros39. The bread basket was very good - in-house freshly baked breads, you cant beat that. We ordered the tete de couchon - it was thinly sliced served with pickled shallots and parsley. Though it looked simple like a piece of charcuterie it was very flavorful and tasty. As soon as we finished eating the busboy came by took all of our butter, silverware and bread plates. We were caught off guard as we would still be enjoying the bread if he didnt remove them. The waiter must realize it because he replaced them and gave us a new bowl of butter.Next we ordered a glass of red each I had a burgundy and my fiance had the bordeaux. My burgundy was too young and acidity not quite as good as the bordeaux. Then I had the special of the night - Lavender duck it was an aged muscovy duck breast. I found it to be interesting that restaurants in DC like to inform that the duck would be served medium because the duck always come out well done. Why bother? I even said please make my duck medium-rare if possible. Also the duck had cooled when it was served to me as well as the there was hardly any trace of lavender. On a good note, the duck breast was well-seasoned and skin was crisp - that made the dish for me. I also enjoyed the endive that was carefully prepared it didnt have any trace of bitterness. My fiance enjoyed his au poivre steak with cognac sauce. He liked the peppercorns on top of the meat saying that was very European style of au poivre, most places in US put the peppercorn into the cognac sauce. Again the busboy came by as soon as we were done this time he picked up my silverware put it on my fiances plate then took his plate put it on my plate instead of removing them away from the table. WOW, training please. However, our server did a fantastic job!The dessert was the chocolate Napoleon - it was nicely plated I liked the thin layers of chocolate used as layering instead of pastry. The caramel was not too sweet. Very nice way to end the dinner. I would definitely go back to try other dishes because even though it looked like a typical French brasserie menu it was a new take of those old classics. There was definitely a difference in terms of the vibes and the food compared to the old school French restaurants in DC. However, it was not cheap.Update: Also I clearly checked in with the host but they did not honor my open table reservation resulting in an email sent to me about a no-show at Le Diplomate. Hello?!, I ate there 4/16 and I was quite impressed. The onion soup and beef bourguignon were excellent. My companion had the duck breast and he said it was the best he has ever had. Be careful with the bread before the meal. It is so good it is easy to fill up on it.It is obvious that they put a lot of effort into the decor. It truly has a real French brasserie vibe. Another thing I really like about this place is that, unlike several new restaurants in the neighborhood that I wont mention, they take reservations. It is really refreshing to be seated right away and not have to wait at some horribly overcrowded bar for 90 minutes. So, the minuses were minor. Some of the tables are too close together (although this is an authentic French brasserie feature). The noise level is very high so I wouldnt recommend this place for intimate conversations. The way the entrance area is designed, if you are unlucky enough to get certain tables (2 tables in particular) and the entrance area is crowded, you will be treated to a view of some random persons derri38re whilst you dine., I had been meaning to try Le Diplomate after living in the neighborhood and watching its transformation over the past year. I walked in last night at around 7:40p without a reservation and was able to get a table for two right away on the sidewalk (which worked out well because I had my dog with us). They actually were very friendly about the dog being there and brought out a water bowl and a homemade dog biscuit for her.All the food and service was good to excellent. The bread bowl provided at the table had three types of bread--each made in house and each delicious.My companion and I both really enjoyed our main courses--I had the steak frites and he had the wild boar parpadelle. We would have liked to try dessert but were too full. I think the only negative critique Id have was the appetizer salad (the salade vert)--it was only okay. It came with whole pieces of bibb lettuce, which required me to cut it, and I thought it was overdressed. Other than that no complaints! Pros:Excellent serviceExcellent foodBeautiful decorCons:Appetizer salad only okayPrices maybe a few dollars per entree more than they ideally would be., So last night big conundrum was deciding whether or not I should eat steamed snow peas for dinner and catching up with the latest Game of Thrones on DVR....or check out the new Logan Circle hot spot that Ie been dying to try for weeks.Because I am writing this review you probably know which idea won.The boy and I arrived a little bit after nine so I did not think we would have a problem getting sat at this enormous French bistro. WRONG! The wait was an hour long, so we decided to seat ourselves at the bar for some cocktails and people watching. Even though the bar was full, I was served almost immediately by a friendly bartender. We ordered the Roland Garros which had a wonderfully light, citrus flavor and the Pompidou Plombier which was basically an amped-up version of an Old Fashioned. The bar patrons were a lively and international bunch and I overheard many different foreign languages peppered into bits and pieces of conversation.By the time we sat down we knew exactly what we had wanted to order: the frisee salad, moules frites, and the beef bourguignon. Let be real, I not really a salad person but the frisee really blew my socks off with its tender duck confit, roasted potato croutons, zesty lemon dressing, and a perfectly poached egg on top. The yolk of the egg mixed in with all of the veggies and Lordy Lordy it was delicious!The moules frites came out next in one of the largest bowls I have ever witnessed in my life. The thing was about two times the size of my head...and my mama told me that my head was in the 98th percentile as an infant! I enjoyed dipping my fries and bread in the broth which was full of light citrus and herb flavors. I will admit that the mussels were a bit dry but after a splash in the old broth bathtub, all was made well again.By the time we got to the beef bourguignon, we were absolutely stuffed. I was able to sample a bite and was met with a tender chunk of beef, a potato puree, red wine reduction, mushrooms and a surprise crispy little pork nugget. To quote Louis Armstrong: Heaven....I in heaven. I am totally looking forward to eating the leftovers as my lunch today.As with any new restaurant, there were many service hiccups. Por ejemplo: I ordered a carafe of wine but apparently the bus boys thought all the carafes were empty wine bottles so they threw it away. Also, the food runner was extremely confused when our salad course came out twice. However, what I can appreciate is the extra steps that our server took to correct every situation and make sure that we were comfortable for the night. To me, that service!Welcome to the neighborhood, Le Diplomate!, I think the best way to describe Le Diplomate is that for what you get it just a smidge overpriced and is trying too hard. When I first walked in I couldn tell if I was in a french restaurant or a Cheesecake Factory, the designer decided to mount bicycles on the wall, opt of drastic aged finishes, and use surfaces that do not absorb any sound (literally, we could not hear anyone in our table of 6 speak). The cocktails were great, but the food was simply average, nothing really blew us away. From the French Onion Soup, to the Muscles, to even the Mac Au Gratin that the server raved so much about. The service was also so all over the place, it felt like it took forever to get drink orders in and to place a food order or for them to run our CC. At the same time, it felt like there were 2 people dedicated to solely filling our water glasses for our table alone! Don get me wrong, I like having my water glass refilled, but after every sip got to be a little too much. I live right around the corner, so Il come back in a few months when maybe they have worked some of the kinks out. Right now they should focus on adding a third dimension to their flavors, figuring out a way to mitigate the sound in the main dining room, and focus more on service., I went last night with 4 girlfriends, and had an OK time. Clearly management is onto something because this place was packed. Unfortunately, the layout of the restaurant is terrible, and leaves much to be desired. The bar is in the middle of the restaurant surrounded by diners who are constantly being hit in the head with over sized purses or elbowed by gentleman clamoring for a drink from one of the grouchy bartenders whose main job seems to be ignoring patrons. I was lucky enough to sidle up to a lovely married couple who added me onto their drink order as the bar tender failed to even acknowledge my presence. No big deal I guess considering their drinks are a bit pricey for what you get. Anyways, we showed up at 7:30pm and was told we would have a 2 hour wait. We stood around for a bit before we decided to go across the street to wait for our table to be ready- I have to say the drinks at Pear Bar are way tastier!We moseyed back across the street around 9:30 expecting our table to be ready...nope! Lo and behold it was 10pm by the time we were seated. Our waiter Chadwick came over and took our orders, everything seemed fine...but then all of our food came out, except for one of our friends. It turns out they were out of the Bouef, but never bother to tell her...what?? It 10:45 at this point and she has no food and they bring out a random thing of mussels for her and comp her a glass of wine. They should have told us they were out of food when we ordered, but also, it still early in the night, who runs out of food?? Chadwick was not very apologetic and actually said he didn hear what our friend ordered when in fact he repeated her order back to her. As far as the rest of the food, everyone was pleased. We ordered the cheese plate, which was very good. I had the asparagus soup, which tasted exactly like it should...I wouldn get it again because it didn have the wow factor. As a vegetarian, there were very limited options: ricotta ravioli, asparagus soup, or an omelette...for dinner? I say no thank you. Good luck fellow veges- this place might not have enough for you.I say wait a few weeks before trying this place out- it SO loud in there you have to shout at your friends, and clearly they don have enough food to feed their patrons. I all for new restaurants, but seriously, work out your kinks before you legitimately open. I don want to be a guinea pig when I forking out some $$ for you. If you want me to be a tester, by all means, holler, and Il come over for free!, Met friends for drinks here. WOW - what a transformation. Great drinks and ambiance. I definitely want to try this place for dinner., PROS: delicious food, beautiful space, loads of outdoor seating, super-friendly service.CONS: expensive, loud, service hiccupsLe Diplomate is a gorgeous space and loaded up with reclaimed wood, tiles, fixtures, furniture and mementos. The servers cutting up the delicious bread in the center of the space creates some theater, and the outdoor patios covered in bright green tile are just far enough off 14th to quiet things down a bit.The steak frites was perfectly cooked and delicious, but too expensive when compared to places like Medium Rare. The duck confit was also great atop a bed of quinoa salad. Finished off the meal with the grapefruit sorbet loaded with real fruit and topped with cinnamon cream and candied rind. A real treat. Our service at the table was very friendly and prompt, however the hostesses were struggling and inefficient. There were seven people behind the bar chatting and cleaning, but only one bartender helping the long line of thirsty patrons. Given how friendly everyone is and how hard they are trying, Im sure they will work out these kinks in time. If Le Diplomate was about 20% less expensive, it would be a weekly visit for me., Two weeks since opening and Le Diplomate is already a city staple. Dominating the corner of Q and 14th, Le Diplomate successfully executes the relaxed Parisian dining experience. Words cannot do justice to this venue. Outdoor, indoor, bar, greenroom?, are a few of the seating options available. Well I dont know how available actually, because during brunch this place was beyond packed. So ladies and gentleman, make a reservation before heading over!And of course, no french restaurant is complete without unnecessarily rude and inefficient hosts. Which is truly why this is a 4 star rating and not 5. All of the three women at the hostess stand yesterday were useless, dismissive and unwelcoming. I understand working out the kinks of a new restaurant, but after being told the wait for a table is 30 minutes, and an hour and a half later, not being seated, when larger parties are walking in without reservations and being seated, I expect some type of emotion/remorse. After telling two of the women there was a table outside that was not being used, I found the third hostess and demanded that she at least look outside to see what was available. Eventually, almost 2 hours after putting in our names, we were seated. I was heated.But then, our waitress came, who was just lovely and so excited to be serving us. We began ordering, first the pastry basket, which was heaven. Then some of us got the french onion soup, the rest of us regretted not doing so when the bowls of liquid gold arrived. Note: the bloody marys here are some of the best in the city, give them a try! The brunch menu is 100% hit, not one miss. Personally, I recommend the Eggs Norwegian, but everyone at my table was moaning over how good their other dishes were. Yes, moaning.So basically, this is your new favorite brunch spot. Hurry now and make a reservation. But it should be noted how livid my entire group and I were over how rude the hosts were to us. So much so that they asked me to describe them in my review, so management can instruct them to be nicer/better human beings going forward. Obviously Im not that cruel, but management, they were the three woman working the brunch shift Sunday the 21st. With that said - I enjoyed Le Diplomate so much that Im trying to find an excuse to go back for dinner tonight. Maybe Ill see you there. :), We came to Le Diplomate on an impulse a couple of weeks ago. We could see the restaurant was absolutely packed and were expecting to be told there was a 3 hour wait and to head to Thaitanic or Teak Wood, where we knew wed be guaranteed a table and a satisfactory dining experience. Hey, that kind of reliability is not a bad thing in this neighborhood.We were pleasantly surprised when the host told us that although the wait for a table inside the restaurant was 2 1/2 hours (ouch!), there was no wait for an outdoor table since it was a rather chilly evening. We looked over, saw a few brave diners huddled around heat lamps, and decided to join them.Service: attentive but not annoying. Could have been a little friendlier (a rather stone-faced, no-nonsense kind of gentleman!) but heck, its like being in Europe. :) Atmosphere: we never actually went inside the restaurant, but the outdoor area is pleasant, if a tad noisy from 14th street traffic. I think we were the most sober people out on that patio and it made for some fun people watching. Drinks: S.O. ordered the tete-a-tete cocktail and was not a huge fan. I stuck with wine (some California chardonnay) and was happy. Appetizer course: we ordered a cheese plate and the fois gras to start. Everything was perfect and the servings were epic. The bread was delicious too.Main: I ordered moules frites, and my S.O. ordered steak frites. His steak was to freakin die for. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly tender, perfectly cooked to his request. My mussels were, sadly, a bit overcooked, and a little bit too lemony for my liking. I still thought they were quite delicious.Dessert: we decided to go all out and got the creme brulee. I am picky as heck about my desserts and I was more than pleased.Verdict: yum! Not cheap, but we kinda went overboard on trying a million different things. We will be back and will try not to gorge ourselves this time., Bienvenue, Le Diplomate!Prior to opening, I been intrigued by the activity going on at the corner of 14th and Q that lead to the opening of Le Diplomate. I had heard that it would be Stephen Starr first foray into the DC area, and that alone got me excited. Starr success in Philadelphia is dramatically outlined by the list of his many concepts there, which have expanded into New York City, Atlantic City and even S. Florida. With brands such as Morimoto and Buddakan under his umbrella, I was sure that Le Diplomate would bring that certain je ne sais quoi to the 14th Street corridor.Sure enough, Le Diplomate opened softly this past April, and has certainly picked-up speed in the days that followed. I met a couple of friends for dinner here the other day... Mind you, I had dined at NYC Balthazar brasserie exactly a week before, so with that experience fresh on my mind, I had high expectations. As expected with any new restaurant opening, the place was abuzz on a Tuesday evening. The bar was packed, the vast dining areas were pretty much filled to capacity, and tables were turning over as quickly as possible... with the line of diners - both with reservations and those hopeful to score something - growing. The vibe of the place definitely gave off that same energy that I had felt at Balthazar, though with a tinge of newness. Though Balthazar has since become fodder for tourists to The Big Apple, Le Diplomate was packed with locals and suburbanites alike -all hoping to experience what this Starr concept had to offer.Our party was seated rather quickly. The Opentable reservation that was made was easily honored. And as soon as we were seated, the brasserie song & dance began... getting better and better with each course. I started off with a glass of C34tes du Rh34ne (red), which I probably shoulde switched out with a white since I opted for escargot and moules for dinner. Nonetheless, I a red drinker at heart, so it really didn matter. The wine was perfect, and hit all the right spots after the long day I had. The escargot was cooked in a hazelnut butter, which was tasty -though slightly a little too buttery for my tastes. But the chopped hazelnut bits in the butter added a nice texture to the escargot -which were perfectly cooked. Each bite practically melted in my mouth, and the buttery broth gave off excellent flavors when paired with the toasted baguette slices. For my main dish, I had to go with something on the lighter side, so moules frites was the perfect choice. The moules were a bit on the smaller size, but tasty (and plentiful!) and plump regardless. The warm broth was delicate, yet uber flavorful; worked nicely as a dip for the frites. For dessert, I went the classic route with cr38me br3bl39, which was nothing less of delicious.My friends also had slam-dunk dishes - steak frites, Norwegian salmon, asparagus soup and macaroni & cheese... all tasty and complementary of one another. And their dessert choices, too, were good. The Baba Au Rhum was definitely not without liquor, almost to a fault. But the pineapple and lime Chantilly served with it helped to even out those flavors. The Apple Tarte Tatin, too, was slightly on the too tart side, but again - the cr38me fra3eche did a nice job evening that out. The cr38me br3bl39 was the clear stand-out, however, and we each took turns with that one till there was nothing left.The restaurant itself is done in a sort of country-side style, apparently with some pieces bought from flea markets in France and Belgium. Bread baskets, wine casks, and vintage photos and other memorabilia dot the dining area, and between the bar and hostess stand is a bread carving station where wait staff take bread baskets for guests. It is loud - conversations bursting at the seams... and amply lit, which makes for a more casual and fun atmosphere. The staff is as quick as a busy restaurant can be. Prices are pretty standard for restaurants these days, and comparable to those prices at Balthazar in NYC, so no surprise to me there. And the quality was great all around. As the weather continues to improve, I hoping to land an outdoor table one evening for wine and dessert... and maybe a side of frites for good measure.A plus tard!, Went here last night and got the pork milanese. It was over cooked and over fried. Almost like something I could have gotten from a high school cafeteria. My friend got Norwegian salmon and said it was dry and not very flavorful. The cheese selection to start off was very nicely done and the server offered great recommendations. Other than the food, the design of the place is acceptable. Its clean and nice, but modern trying to look old and classy. The the service was excellent. Overall though, just go to Bistro du Coin. The food is significantly better and the not as expensive and the experience is more authentic., I was so excited to try Le Diplomate, but I was mostly underwhelmed. I will start by saying that the decor and the atmosphere were amazing, we sat on the patio, and there is nothing better than being in the sunshine drinking a glass of wine.The service was sub par, I know its a new restaurant and they have to work out the kinks, but we waited almost 15 minutes after being seated for our waitress to come by, which to me is unacceptable. By the time she came by we were ready to order, but ordered wine first, and she said she would come back for our food order. 10 minutes later she was back with our wine, which was then promptly spilled all over the table. Luckily we emerged unscathed by the red wine, but we basically cleaned the table ourselves. She did bring an extra glass of wine to replace what was spilled, but my experience is when something like this happens more is done to make up for it.Food wise, I ordered the steak frites medium rare and it came out medium well. I was not happy. My dining companion had the beef bourguignon, which she raved about. We had the chocolate napolean and chocolate creme pot for dessert, both of which I would recommend. Overall I thought the restaurant was overpriced for the lack of service and only ok food. There are a number of less expensive french restaurants in DC that do it better. That being said I would return because sitting on the patio watching the hustle and bustle of 14th street was definitely entertaining., Coming from someone who has actually eaten at an authentic Parisian bistro in Paris, Le Diplomate is very close to the real deal. I enjoyed my experience from the moment I walked in. My boyfriend and I were greeted and immediately seated even without a reservation (on a Tuesday right at 5pm). The service was great; our French waiter was very nice and ensured that we had a great dining experience.For the drinks, they have a wide variety to choose from. I was in the mood for a white wine and their Pino Grigio was very good. My boyfriend tried two different cocktails and were very impressed by both. I look forward to coming again and trying something new.In regards to our food it was fantastic. We started with the escargots, which were in a tasty sauce paired with fresh bread. They were very good....and of course you have to dip your bread in for every last drop ;) We also loved the cheese plate. I, myself, am a lover of those cheese plates and I really like the honeycomb and other fruits that come with it. The bread that is provided is served fresh and is delicious.I chose the Moules Frites (mussels) as my main dish, which of course was also very good. However, I realized that dish is pretty straightforward and next time Im going to try something a little more substantial. It came with a side of their french fries...and who hates fries? My boyfriend had the Veal Escalope and also raved about it. I had a bite and from that I could tell that it was very tasty and would definitely consider ordering it. We ended our meal with the classic Vanilla Creme Brulee...and of course its to die for.Overall, we were both very pleased with our meal and the service and care we received while dining there. I do recommend that those who like a quieter space to eat and be with company to dine earlier in the evening before the young professionals come out. It does get a bit louder since the bar is near the dining area, so expect that when making your dinner plans. Its a great place for a happy hour as well, as the mood and ambiance is warm and inviting. All in all, its a happy place to be :), Everything is right about Le Diplomate: location, decor, service, brunch, dinner, cocktails, wine, coffee, bread, bathrooms, atmosphere, everything. Ive now been for brunch and as of tonight, dinner. The Foie Gras was delicious and the Steak Au Poivre was the best Id ever had. It was seasoned generously (I like a little kick) and cooked perfectly. GO TO HERE. Run, dont walk. No, really--it gets super crowded and without a reservation or getting there as soon as they open, youre going to be waiting a while. Enjoy!, A welcome addition to the U street/Logan Circle scene. Steak au Poivre = fantastic portion, really tender and well seasonedEscargot = served in a mini dutch oven. the meat was surprising plump. The presentation would have been more impressive if they served the snails in the shellLamb shank = Rather small portion than most lamb shanks Ive had in the past, but the meat was fall-of-the-bone-tender and the couscous was a great accompaniment.Our waiter, Mark, was great and seemed to really enjoy what he does. He was very patient with my friend would was incredibly indecisive when choosing the entrees.The bartender was also incredibly friendly and excited to serve the customers. I think this place has the potential to become an institution in DC., I was so excited to see the online menu several weeks before Le Diplomate opening. As soon as I saw the graphics and the menu, I thought ah, like Pastis in the meat packing district in NYC. So kudos to Stephen Starr for bringing one of my favorite NYC places (only in the sit outside weather) to my new locale in DC. Two of us went hungry, so we shared the mussels as an appetizer, followed by the frisee salad with duck confit and the burger as the entrees. Everything was just lovely and having a French waiter just added to the charm. We even had a lovely conversation about the Stephen Starr empire when one of the general managers stopped by. We will be back. However, we had a reservation, booked well in advance and were glad we did. Make sure you have one too., Just had dinner at Le Diplomate... already thinking about who I want to take with me on my next visit. I went with four friends and they seated us shortly after we all arrived.The first thing to note is how gorgeous the restaurant is. I had heard that a good chunk of money went into transforming the interior and it really shows. The restaurant is gigantic and I was impressed by the details that went into it - everything from the slow-spinning ceiling fan, the bike on top of the bar, the beautifully painted ceilings and walls, etc. I also loved the bread station by the front door too. Oh, speaking of bread, it was amazing. The challenge is to not fill up on them before the food arrives... so good.As a true glutton, I decided to order three appetizers instead of one before entree. I told my dining guests that I would share with them but there really weren much sharing on my part. I decided on the Foie Gras Parfait, Mushroom Tart, and Steak Tartare. The server asked me how I wanted it presented - all at once, please!Foie Gras Parfait - absolutely phenomenal, the foie gras parfait itself is very light airy and the it was accompanied with a sweet fennel aigre-doux jam and brioche. The combination of the three things together was heaven.Mushroom Tart - looks like a pizza sliced in quarters, the top layer is covered with grated truffle pecorino, with mushrooms in the middle and a really flaky tart on the button. Delicious.Steak Tartare - once again, very simple presentation with only three things on the plate - the tartare with a quail egg on top, a small chopped salad and crispy baked bread. The flavors of the tartare was beautifully balanced. The meat tasted super fresh and the horseradish really adds a nice to kick to it/Okay, after I conquered all of that, my Duck Breast and Leg Confit arrived. The breast itself was cooked a little over mid-rare (what was recommended to me and what I agreed to) but it was still very tender and juicy. The rhubarb vinaigrette didn blow me away either but the leg confit was marvelous. The meat was so soft and delicate and it falls right off the bone. As a whole, the dish worked with the farro salad and I was satisfied. Not as mind blowing as the apps though.Time for dessert - Vanilla Cr38me Br3bl39eOne of the best I have ever had. It was perfectly creamy and the torched sugar crust on top cracked beautifully.The service was great. I had some odd requests and the server was able to help me out with everything I needed. Certain things took a bit longer but that to be expected at a restaurant of this volume. He was very friendly and very professional. The food came out at a very impressive rate. We were all very impressedHaving only heard wonderful things about this new restaurant, I went in with very high expectations. I was not disappointed at all.Tip #1: The restaurant is rather loud and it can be hard to hear each other if you go in a large party. This isn a mark against Le Diplomate, it actually speaks to the liveliness of the atmosphere. I went on a Sunday night and it was still full by 10pm when we walked out. Just be prepared to speak loudly.Tip #2: Everything on the menu looks amazing. Not really a tip, but just know that you might have hard time deciding if youe like me and you want to try everything!Who wants to go with me next time?!?!? :P, While everyone else was out celebrating at a Derby Day party or just taking advantage of a beautiful Saturday afternoon, the girlfriend and I decided to check out Le Diplomate to see what the fuss was all about. Dinner service starts at 5. We arrived about 30 minutes early for dinner with the intention of having a drink then ordering dinner entrees once dinner service started. Since it was a beautiful day, all of the tables were taken on the spacious sidewalk dining area, which woulde meant a short wait for a table. There were still plenty of tables to be had elsewhere and we didn feel like waiting. We asked and the hostess graciously agreed to seat us at a two top in the covered, open-air sunroom that still allowed us to enjoy the fresh air and comfortable temperature. Once seated, our server, Maxwell, capably served us. He was personable, attentive, and obviously knowledgeable about the food and drinks, effectively answering all of our menu questions. I started off with the Pompidou Plombier ($12), a delicious concoction made with Bulleit Bourbon, espresso bean infused Punt e Mes sweet vermouth, and Cr38me de Cacao garnished with an orange slice and bourboned cherry. yelp.com/biz_photos/le-d206 It was an inventive and enjoyable combination of two of my favorite things, bourbon and coffee! Much less successful, though, was my second round, a Sazerac ($10), which tasted a bit unbalanced lacking much, if any, of the sweetness normally imparted by a muddled sugar cube. For our food, we received the obligatory basket of bread. While the basket may have been obligatory, the baguette, cranberry walnut (?), and a crusty wheat (?) were far from pedestrian and almost meals unto themselves. We started with orders of the Steak Tartare de Parc ($15.50) and since they were out of the Foie Gras (a bit surprising since it was the start of dinner service), the Escargots ($14). yelp.com/biz_photos/le-d206 We received a generous portion of hand-chopped filet, served with capers and topped with a quail egg. The finely diced filet was moist, tender, rich, and flavorful. Le Diplomate traditional approach and keen execution resulted in their tartare being the best rendition Ie ever had. The gf and I were split on the escargots. I liked them much more than she did. I liked the liberal amounts of butter and garlic that bathed the snails served in a small Le Creuset-type crock. She didn care for the presentation and found the snails to be a little overdone, tough, and the butter excessive. I could see her point. For our entr38es, we had the Moules Frites ($19) and the Duck Breast and Leg Confit ($27). yelp.com/biz_photos/le-d206 Le Diplomate moule frites (or at least the moules) easily matched, if not surpassed what you could find in any restaurant in the DC-area. The fresh mussels were sizable, steamed perfectly, leaving them plump and juicy. The delicious marini38re style sauce seemed creamier and more indulgent than other versions Ie encountered. It possessed a generous amount of butter, of course, that worked in complete concert with the white wine, shallots, and garlic. We had to resist sopping up every last drop with our bread. The fries were nicely fried, crispy and good, but they were still only pommes frites. Equally enjoyable was the duck. The meaty breast and large leg portion were perfectly prepared and amazingly tender especially compared to what Ie received at other restaurants. The farro was a nice accompaniment and offered the dish a nice rustic look and feel. Not that we needed any more food (we didn!), but we ended our dinner by splitting the Apple Tarte Tatin ($8). yelp.com/biz_photos/le-d206 Nicely tart apples, not overly sweet, the dessert served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cr38me fraiche was a satisfying grand finale to our meal. Ie never been to a French bistro in Paris, let alone France, so I have neither basis nor any legitimacy to proclaim Le Diplomate authenticity. All I can say is that Le Diplomate is the bistro I hope I find if/when I find myself in Paris., Mussels were delicious and the broth was perfect & not too rich. The bread basket was also great especially the cranberry loaf. The mushroom tart appetizer was good but extremely rich & we couldnt quite finish it., This is one of my favorite new restaurants in town! Was in DC this past weekend and had dinner here with good friends. Food was great! and it was a nice place overall to get together with friends. I believe Le Diplomate just opened recently, which is impressive given the quality of the food and service.Food - We ordered a variety of places, from mussels to burgers and fish. All of the dishes were executed very well. Portions and preparations were right on point. Service - Service was friendly and fine, even after keeping his table occupied without ordering for about 15 minutes while we waited on a friend to arrive (we forgave him since we was procuring cocktails for all of us for later in the evening). Ambiance - This place is even bigger than what it appears from the outside. It has a great energy and sound to get you ready for a night of fun. Overall, this is one place I hope keeps firing on all cylinders as time goes on, as I would like to make it back when we come to DC again. Tip: That bread table right at the entrance, while tempting when you are hungry and having a drink by the bar, is not a self service station as I believed it was when we arrived. lol, Still the hottest new restaurant in the District, Le Diplomate certainly lives up to the hype. It presents itself as a French style bistro, complete with cute little cafe chairs on the patio that youd surely find on a Paris street corner.The waiters cut your complimentary bread right off the baguettes in a station located right in the center of the restaurant near the bar. This was pretty unique and provided some nice aromas as we waited for our table. We enjoyed an early dinner on a nice sunny day out on the fairly large patio. The two things I took away from my experience are that (1) the wine list is very expansive and informs you of the area in France in which your wine is from and (2) the mushroom tart may have been the best dish Ive tasted all year.I would definitely recommend making reservations on OpenTable at least 2 weeks in advance if you plan to go on the weekend. Otherwise, go early. We arrived a little before 6pm on a Saturday and only had to wait 30 minutes for a table for two outside.I look forward to seeing what their brunch menu has to offer. If its as satisfying as their dinner menu, were in for a treat., Great location, decent food, corporately over-the-top/cheesy decor (think Paris Applebees). Friendly but frazzled service and sticker shock (for a bistro) prices., very impressive restaurant. very well designed, felt close to a parisian bistro but 5 times as big. went for brunch and it was packed. ordered a cafe latte which was delicious, my friend had a grapefruit cocktail which was also tasty. started out with the basket of baked goods, and let me say they were AMAZING. the croissants were typical, plain, chocolate, apple. there was a brioche with a lemon sugar cube at the bottom, a blueberry muffin which was out of this world, and some delicious sugar crusted yeasted lemon rye pastry incredible-ness I would go back just to have again. we also tried the mushroom tart which had a creamy sauce on top of a flaky pastry, with a variety of different mushrooms, really well done. the main courses were good as well, the spinach goat cheese omelette had a lot of spinach but it really wasnt warmed through so the goat cheese wasnt quite melty enough. the crispy potatoes that came with were great. everyone was very happy with what they ordered. finally for dessert (dont miss dessert) we got the lemon confit. an entire candied lemon on top of a lemon sable biscuit filled with a lemon vanilla custard and topped with meringue, pretty perfect. the service was in and out, the waitress was clearly swamped and there was a bit of a drag time between the dishes but overall a really great addition to DC!, I understand that DC is starved for trendy and classy new places, but this place is nothing more than average. Sure it physically impressive and full of well dressed clientele, but the food is overpriced and blah. The best (and only good) food Ie had there is the bread basket. Should have stopped there. The Monday special duck was bland and insultingly small at $29. The burger is a weak Big Mac knockoff with 2 thin, dry patties covered in cheap thousand island dressing. Not worth the hype, the wait, or the money. Stick to Bistro du Coin if you want decent French bistro fare., Step 1: Order food and wine.Step 2: Place first bite into mouth. Step 3: Immediately lock eyes with your date across the table, and blankly stare... understanding that theyre experiencing the same mouth-gasm you are.Step 4: Plan your next reservation.We absolutely destroyed the mushroom tart, sea bass, lavender roast duck (Monday night special-- a MUST!!!!), and the milk chocolate pot de creme. All were amazing., Fantastic food, atmosphere, service, drinks....everything! I spent two summers in France and theyve really nailed down the culture of a french dining experience from the street dining to people watch to the delicious food. I started off with a sazarec that was mixed to perfection and the french onion soup, which was a rich treat. For dinner I had the table wine and the beef bourguignon, perfection! I cant wait to go back when its nice outside to enjoy the full experience and try more food on the menu., Almost every aspect of this restaurant shines and deserves five stars. I am wary of hype and overpriced restaurants on 14th Street but this place really is as good as you could hope.The ambiance is unbeatable. You simply will not find such a beautiful interior anywhere in the area. The decoration is impeccable.The patio is easily the nicest around. It was cold and rainy and we were covered and warm. It is spacious. This patio will be killer during the summer.The drink list was fantastic. I really like wine and Belgian beer but I like American IPAs more so I was very happy to finally go to a French place and find a great selection of American craft.The food was delicious. The highlights from three different peoples meals (all fantastic) were the Asparagus Soup & the Rigatoni Au Foie de Poulet (Chicken liver Rigatoni). We told our server we wanted something we couldnt get at any other Belgian/French place and he sold me on the Rigatoni. If you are a liver lover then this is a must.This is a welcome addition to the area and it will no doubt be full anytime you want to make a reservation, but it is well worth the wait., Le Diplomate allows you to feel like you are away from the craziness of DC. I seriously felt like I was in a movie while I was eating there. Opt for the outdoor seating, you will not regret it. This may be the coolest place in DC to sit outside and drink a glass of wine.The wine list is superb. They also have a great bread basket. I could sit outside and eat baguettes and drink wine all day at Le Diplomate. Actually, that sounds totally ideal. I ordered the duck breast and leg confit for dinner and it was truly divine. The confit was not overly oily, which was a huge plus. The addition of rhubarb to the farro salad was a nice touch.The service was sweet and a member of the management walked around and asked diners if they enjoyed everything.Seriously cool place. It is a bit pricey compared to other restaurants, but it is fantastic., Was only able to get in for dessert and coffee. That was really good so I can only imagine what the first few courses would be like. Will have to try a full dinner., Last night we had happy hour with a group of about 12 at Le Diplomate, which just opened a couple weeks ago on 14th Street (they dont actually have happy hour deals, but we thought itd still be a fun place to get together). The restaurant is built in a building that used to be a laundromat - my husband says it was actually operating the first year or two we we lived in this neighborhood, but it always looked abandoned to me. Either way, youd never guess that now. I thought the food and drinks at Le Diplomate were good, though the food was a bit expensive ($17 for a half-dozen oysters, $35 for a cheese place with 7 cheeses). I had mixed feelings about the service - to be fair, we were a difficult group, with people coming and going, mostly ordering lots of drinks and assorted appetizers, while Le Diplomates patio is more geared towards normal restaurant activity (though we still spent more than $400) They brought us extra chairs at times, but denied our request to expand to the empty table next to us when some late arrivals showed up - instead seating other people there and seating our friends on the other side of the restaurant, even though the two groups were seated at the same time (if you had two open four tops, why not just seat people in the configuration that will make the most people happy?). However, they have an amazing patio with lots of space, and they make an excellent Pimms Cup, so Id still put it on the list of good summer restaurants., I was really disappointed as this restaurant did not live up to the hype. While the interior and ambiance were great, the service was poor and the food was mediocre at best. We were seated almost 40 minutes after our reservation time, the host insisted that it was not raining (when in fact it was) when offering an outside table, and the host was generally rude and stressed. As for the food, I had the crab mayonaise to start, and while the mayonaise was quite flavorful, the crab didnt impress me. I also had the steak frites: the fries were on the cold side and the steak was so incredibly salty, I could barely handle a couple bites., I loved the decor and the space at Le Diplomate. The bread is delicious and the cheese plate is, as well. The service needs a lot of work. The waiter had no idea what he was talking about when my friend was asking about a certain dish and then he handed us off to another waiter and hadnt put my other friends order in. It was a bit of a mess.They only comped the two items that were screwed up after my friend talked to the manager...something they should have done as a courtesy., Great new addition to 14th Street. When I think of the transformation from derelict old abandoned Shirty cleaners to probably the smartest looking restaurant on 14th Street, I just shiver me timbers. Stopped in here for dinner and drinks the other day, and it was good all around. Mind you, I showed up around midnight on a Friday, so I didnt have to deal with the nasty crowds I hear mob this place during normal business hours. Still, even having a delicious restaurant in DC that serves dinner and is hopping at midnight is a glorious revelation in itself.Was able to order the $28 white wine carafe, which is a good deal and tasty. Followed that up with a three cheese tray for $15; the servings of cheese were very generous and were accompanied by delicious fruit. Having become accustomed to the minuscule and expensive fromagerie tastings in NYC, I considered the Diplomate version a blessing. Ended up the dinner with the Steak Frites. An ungodly amount of well prepared french fries were offered, and were very good. The steak too was well prepared, tender, and all together a wonderful treat.The decor is impeccable and reminds me of Pastis in NYC, a very faithful reproduction of a charming Paris brassiere; certainly more charming than any I went to when I was frigging in Paris last year. And the food was better!, Pro- nice interior design work. reminds me of the Disney version of what a Paris brasserie should look like. - great wine list- dessert(s)Con- Service. Slow. - DO NOT ORDER THE ESCARGOT. Watered down sauce + Cold. I love escargot, just not from here.- Cold fries...wtf is up with the cold fries. and you give so many..its a bit of a turn off., Feels like it has been here forever. There are already a ton of reviews of Le Diplomate so I wont get too exhaustive here because the hype is correct. Ive had multiple dinners and brunches here since they opened and each time was a pleasant experience where I was given excellent service by all levels of staff, the food was executed perfectly, and tasted amazing. Everything Ive ordered from the basic salade verte (green salad), the steak tartare, onion soup (life changing), foie gras, and any entree have all been perfection. The waiters have been perfect each time recommending drinks and wine to pair with the food at each course, and the management staff attentive without hovering over patrons like hawks. But what I love bast about Le Diplomate is the space, it feels timeless, like its been on 14th for generations, and pulls this off effortlessly. Id expect nothing less of STARR Restaurants. I dont ask for much more than good food, good service, and a comfortable space to enjoy both in from any restaurant. So if youre looking for a beautiful space that really does transport you to Paris and the food to back it up with, give Le Diplomate a try. You wont be disappointed., Went here to celebrate my husbands birthday. I called them in the morning to make sure they put a candle or something on the dessert, because I wanted the experience to be special. So the evening rolls in and we head to Le Diplomat. I squeeze through the hoards of people waiting for a table and tell the host my name for the reservation and she yells out...Yeah...you are here to celebrate a birthday, right? Whose birthday is it, his... WHT!!! Way to go to make someone feel awkward - thanks Lady!The food was good, the onion soup and the beef bourguignon were excellent. We shared a dark chocolate napoleon for dessert which was super delicious (and yes - they did put a candle on it ) Overall food and experience was great after we were seated, Im taking a star for the stupidity of the hostess. Maybe the next time Ill bring my own candle!, Loved this place. Family brought be here when I was visiting and the food and service was amazing. My cup never went empty!, As a recent move to Logan Circle, I had high hopes for this place that I saw under construction on 14th street; while there are a lot of good restaurants in the area, Estadio and the Pig, another addition is always a welcome sight. Especially after it took me two weeks to finally get a reservation after the soft opening, I came in with great expectations. Restaurants are pretty much defined by service & food; in the first category, our waiter started appearing more slowly as the meal went on and in the end when we wanted to pay so we could escape the terrible food, our server never appeared and we had to flag down another one so we could get the check. The food is done in a classic brasserie style but the prices are downright ridiculous. While they may have been relevant to NYC-esque prices, I not sure where the restaurant gets off on charging $11 for an onion soup; if the food was competently done then I might be a little less peeved with having to pay what I did but that is sadly not the case. My criticism of the food can be summed up in Julia Child famous maxim on French cooking of adding more butter to everything one cooks; the chefs at this restaurant have taken this to a new extreme. I ordered the hangar steak and frites; the fries were actually the highlight of the meal and I enjoyed them. However, the hangar steak was absolutely uneatable; it felt like it had been injected with butter, marinated in butter and had a last serving of butter plastered on to it while going to our table. The onion soup would have been better called a butter soup and at after two bites, I couldn eat anything. Even after this short dinner, I felt as if I had been forced to eat two sticks of butter and even beer couldn wash away the taste. In short, service is terrible, the food takes butter usage to an exponential level, and the prices think that wee in Sweden. Not worth it at all., Its always annoying to agree with the group but Le Diplomate is pretty good. Advice though- their bar is the way to go if it is just you and another. It is hard to get reservations here, and you dont pick up that much by sitting at a table. The bar feels authentically Parisian, is always hopping, and has lots of seating. And you can get the full menu here. Great for a happy hour. Recommendation on martini and the steak tartare. Pretty awesome., Delicious!! It was well worth the wait. I tried the onion soup, foie gras, tuna carpaccio, and frisee salad. The only thing that I didnt love was the frisee-- it was excessively greasy, even for someone who loves greasy food. It may have been the croutons that soaked up too much oil.The three different kinds of bread (that came in the basket) were heavenly. They were baked to perfection in-house (I missed going to restaurants that serve real bread), and my friend and I wolfed all of it down. The foie gras was silky and smooth, the best Ive had. Waitstaff was also good. This may become my new go-to place., An experience full of some highs and some lows. The hostesses are polite, but seem overwhelmed by the crowds, which are large. Be prepared to wait longer than their initial quotes if youre hoping for an outside seat (Im talking 30-45 minutes longer than they say). Weve tired unsuccessfully to get tables a number of times but have given up in frustration after waiting well beyond our initial quote. The first time we came in, we waited 45 minutes for an outside table, which was the hostess quote. We we checked back in we were told it was now going to be another hour to an hour an half. We gave up in frustration after that.Finally able to secure a table (waited 75 minutes when quoted 45), we had a pleasant dinner. Food was good to very good. Some items were too salty, other items seemed like there was none. Overall, very flavorful and well prepared. Portion sizes tended toward the smaller side.Service started out friendly, but went down hill from there. Our server seemed overwhelmed and disappeared for a while and we were left to flag down other servers and bussers for water and wine refills. The managers sensed our frustration and to their credit apologized and tried to make amends.Overall, Id give it 4 stars for food and 2 stars for service. Heres to hoping they are able to work out service issues because its a beautifully designed restaurant., Wow, kind of pricey given the casual open air bistro concept. Dinner for two with wine, salads, sides, and a shared desert killed most of $200, and while it was good, it was NOT $200 good. Blessedly, we had a table inside, but all the folding patio doors were flung wide open, so it got very hot inside, very fast. The patio patrons were comically buffeted by great gusts of dust and trash-filled wind that were blowing down Q Street, punctuated by the sirens of DC cop cars roaring past as well. This, plus the mobs of pretentious, raucously braying DC wannabes aggressively striving for any table, or even just any place at the bar, give the experience a loud and chaotic ambiance that gets very tiresome, very fast, especially at these prices. I had an early reservation, and was allowed to claim the table before my guest arrived (kindalate) and I was not given any ude about occupying table space with a glass of Malbec while waiting, so that was a touch of class that is well appreciated, as so many popular eateries now seem to have eat/pay/get out as their customer service mantra. My guest, out on the sidewalk after our meal said, with a wry smile, Well, once again, the Emperor has no clothes!, Had a wonderful meal here, came on a Tuesday night w/o reservations and were told wed wait over an hour, unless we were willing to take the risk of getting rained on at a sidewalk table. Our gamble worked and we had a romantic sidewalk cafe meal. We started with the delectable mushroom tart, and also had a 5-cheese plate, with nice sides of nuts, raisins, honey, and preserves. Combined with delicious complimentary bread (3 different kinds), we were starting to get full already but we had already ordered two entrees. My lamb shank was falling-off-the-bone delicious....obviously a nice cut of meat but also prepared to perfection. GF had Veal Escalope and enjoyed it as well. We were too full for dessert so cant speak to that. If you can eat outside, recommend you do, unless you like high noise levels While we waited for our table, the effect of hard floors, walls, and ceilings was evident, and even on a Tuesday night it was full. There are lots of outdoor spaces, so seems like there are good options for all. Our waitress was attentive and the servers clearly worked as a team clearing tables, etc. This one lived up to the hype, at least for us!, We celebrated our anniversary last nite at Le Diplomate.We had a terrific time! It reminded very much of a Paris cafeon a grand level ! Mr. Starr, again, has done a great job!We ate outside, which is really a must,as I said ,the place is huge and very loud!!The service was excellent from beginning to end, our waiter was helpful,attentive& pleasant .First, I need to tell you that the bread is incredible ,the best we have had!!beware it is quite filling.I had the Veal which was amazing and my wife had the warm shrimp salad which was a generous portion.The carafe of wine for 28$ is good,not great ...we drank it all .The chocolate torte was rich and incredibly delicious ,we enjoyed every bite!Le Diplomate is a welcomed addition and certainly does not disappoint, we most definitely will be back!!, Overrated.Husband and I came on a Saturday night with a reservation and had to wait 20+ minutes to be seated. Ordinarily we would have grabbed a drink at the bar but said bar was mobbed, and the place was so busy we were concerned that if we lost sight of the hostess we would not be seated. When we finally were seated, it was in a section of the restaurant that was open air on a relatively cool evening, and with the fans running we were both cold and I wore my jacket most of the time. Famished, we devoured the bread--which was good, but nothing amazing--when it arrived. Our waitress was friendly and seemed to be trying but service was slow and we got the sense that they were simply too busy. We were given a free appetizer, as was the table next to us, due to our wait for the table, but we didnt eat much of it as it arrived after wed devoured the bread basket and a round of drinks. I ordered the mussels and my husband ordered the steak frites. The food was good, but again, nothing amazing. Service continued to be slow and it took forever to get the check. Enjoyed the decor, but felt it no better than other bistros in the area. In short, not worth the hype and the crowds. We will stick with our other favorite bistros (Bistro de Coin, Napolean, Bastille)., I was so excited to finally get a reservation here that I lost my head and caused a conflict in HH to dinner planning with Heather G. Sorry, sweetie! I just couldnt pass up a same day reservation at this place! Every other attempt Ive made at getting in has failed miserably. The coincidence of someone cancelling their 6:30pm table just a few moments before I called was just too much for me to pass up.This restaurant runs on overdrive. I imagine it will slow down, but right now its like walking into an ant mound after waters been poured on it; workers scrambling about, busy trying to keep everything from falling apart. Standing in the middle of it kind of got my claustrophobia flaring. I was so thankful to finally be allotted a personal bubble at our table. Another 10 minutes of that chaos would have been enough for me to forfeit my super awesome, this never happens on a Friday night at 6:30pm, same day reservation. Even though my friend and I were granted a small sanctuary at our table, we still had a hard time hearing each other talk over the bustling crowd. I know this wouldnt bother most people, but I am admittedly a little fussy about noise in any environment let alone a restaurant.Service was pretty good. Even though she was very busy with other tables, our waitress never put us on ignore. She was also quick to bring the restaurants sommelier to help us with our wine selection. I love sommeliers. Not because I ever want to chat up the latest and greatest wines, but rather because I love a good wine but have no idea where to begin picking one out. Having someone available to do all the research for me is greatly appreciated.I really loved the giant basket of bread that is complimentary to every table. I also love that you get to see it being cut fresh at the front of the restaurant. No secondhand bread here! The cranberry walnut was off the hook. Id buy a loaf of it to take home if I could. The baguette and other somewhat sourdough-rye-like bread were decent, and great for dipping in my bouillabaisse, but not nearly as good as the latter.I ordered the Friday special of bouillabaisse while Heather G. ordered the steak frites. Although I didnt taste her steak or frites, I cant say it looked overly appetizing. I do love my friend, but she has got to stop being afraid of rare meat. Her medium-well hanger looked reminiscent of my old bosss homemade beef jerky. Not awesome. :( My bouillabaisse was well cooked in that the mussels and fish were all at perfected doneness, but the tomato broth was kind of blah. I originally had wondered why I was given a mayonnaise based dipping sauce, but quickly realized that it was the only thing that supplied flavor to the dish. Also...two little croutons for dipping? Correct me if Im wrong, but isnt bouillabaisse much like mussels in that it is all about dipping bread in the broth? I know we were given lots of bread at the beginning of our meal, but I expected separate, maybe even special, bread to come out with my dish. Not awesome.I hope Le Diplomate starts living up to all its hype soon. If it doesnt, Ill definitely never rush HH again to make a reservation., Im giving Le Diplomate the nod based on several factors, but Ive also got a sticking point that needs to be pointed out.Firstly, as a new establishment, this place is BOOMING. Glad my friends got a 6:15 reservation in on a Friday evening, because that line was going around the corner. The lobby is a mad-house, with no less than 5 hosts/hostesses donning the station and eager patrons milling around waiting for their seating. Yes, there were lots of tourists. Yes, it is very French in decor.Amazingly, we were sat before 6:15, Im assuming to expedite, but that was a nice bonus. Our waiter came over promptly and asked if wed like any beverages while we looked over the menu, and he wasnt pushy even though we opted for waters. Have to give kudos to him, as he was patient with our table throughout the night (we were a bit indecisive on the menu) and gave use his suggestions.The breadbasket was a hit - three varieties of bread. A small baguette, a wheat loaf, and a loaf with cranberries and nuts. I didnt use the house butter, but others liked it, as they were spreading it on everything.We wanted to order family style, and our waiter was totally cool with it. So we ordered up one starter and three mains - the mushroom tart, steak au poivre, grilled loup de mer, and the duck breast and leg confit. He brought us all separate plates in addition to the dishes themselves. Oh, and the dishes came out very quickly, within 10-15 minutes Id estimate. Suspiciously quick, but maybe their kitchen is just that efficient?My favorites were the mushroom tart and duck plates by far. The tart had a great buttery pastry, topped with small, tender mushrooms and pecorino shavings. The duck breast was very tender, flavorful, and was a generous portion with the added farro and bean salad.The steak au poivre was not bad either - well crusted with pepper, and the steak was tender enough. We ordered it medium-rare, but it came out more like medium to medium well. We didnt point it out, since it didnt upset anyone really. Probably a hit-or-miss on cooking temps. The garlic spinach was good and not overly greasy.The grilled sea bass was good as well and a generous portion - you get the whole fish. The meat was tender, and the large bean salad accompanying it was actually quite nice.We decided to finish with a dark chocolate napoleon dessert, and that was a good option. Lots of chocolate mousse, fancy thin chocolate layering, hazelnut ice cream, and crunchy chocolate things. Good deal.So the food quality is good, and the service is actually good. The sticking point is the price. While it may command the prices (averaging $30 a plate) because of location and novelty, its really pushing Le Diplomate into fine-dining territory if you think about it. This is supposed to be a bistro affair, so the portions may be generous for some dishes, many others are actually relatively small. If you opt for a wine or other beverage with your meal, plan on at least $40-$50 per person. At that price point, Im not really thinking bistro anymore. However, Le Diplomate may justify it with food quality. Im just having a hard time envisioning a $50 bistro.In any case, Ill have to give it another go to make a better informed opinion. For now, Le Diplomate is justified in being the Logan Circle hotspot this Summer., I was dying to try this new place out, so was beyond excited for our brunch reservation here on Sunday. For a new place, this place is packed. I didnt wait too long to be seated.My friends and I ordered 2 mimosas and a negroni. Loved both - one of the best mimosas Ive had (ie not 100% OJ w a splash of prosecco like most places). We asked our server Will (who Id recommend in a heartbeat) recommended 3 different plates to share. We got the french toast, poached egg basquaise, and steak and eggs. One of the best french toasts in town. Also a good portion size. Unlike the steak & eggs. The steak was the size of a babys fist which I found to be disappointing, but it was cooked perfectly, so Ill let it slide. Loved everything about the poached egg, minus I wish it had something crunchy to go with the mushy polenta and poached egg. We ended brunch with the candied lemon dessert, and a hazelnut pastry thing. Although its candied, I was still hoping for a little tart flavor to cut through the sweetness, but it was more sweet than anything. Hazelnut pastry was just fine, nothing to write home about.I definitely want to come back for dinner, or even brunch again. Its a beautiful restaurant, I really liked our server (Will), and the food was tasty!
36|lupo-verde-washington|This is one of my new favorite spots. First, the restaurant has a warm ambiance that is upbeat and urban. We started with the Burrata Salad and Crostini. The Burrata salad was fabulous. We ordered some processco and the Pino Grigio on draft... Both were good. The meal came with bread and olive oil for dipping.. the olive oil was great!We ordered a pizza with eggplant and sausage, which was amazing and we were talked into getting the Testa, which sounds terrible but was seriously delicious. I cant wait to go back and order the fish. Dont miss this spot! Will definitely be back!!, This place was so good I went back two nights in a row. Hits all three boxes: Great Drink (cocktails and wine), Great Food and most importantly Great Service/Atmosphere. Good place to have a drink and snack with friends or to take a date. I am Italian and almost never eat italian food outside of italy but my friend brought me and I felt at home. I might have to make it 3 nights in a row now!, I had been eagerly waiting for this place to open up and I was not disappointed. Its my new favorite Italian spot on 14th Street. Antonio was great and made several suggestions for our dinner. We had the octopus, chickpea soup, potatoes and another thats name I cannot recall. Everything was delicious! Im usually not a big fan of octopus but I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. The chickpea soup is absolutely spectacular! I couldnt get over how good it was and made sure to scrape every bit out of the bowl. For dessert we had the coco nono (something like that?), which was a semifreddo lined with nutella. Absolutely amazing! The ambiance, service and wine and cocktail menu are all top notch as well. Needless to say, Ill be visiting this place again and again., I cant say enough about this place. Best cheese plate and cured meats in the city (believe me, its my go to app wherever I go). House red (on tap!) is great and so was the cocktail I had. They serve some wickedly righteous grub. Looking forward to retuning and cant wait until its warm enough to sit outside., This place has the WORST SERViCE in DC. Although we had a reservation made 2 days before they made us wait more than one hour without ever bothering to let us know what was going on, never apologizing for the delay or taking care of us. After one hour they were still not able to give us our table and we left. They did not seem to care less and did not even say bye. The food on the tables seemed mediocre and below DC and italian average. I will never give this place a second chance. They wasted my time and ruined my saturday dinner. certain people should not be allowed to run restaurants and ruin the image of Italian restaurants. Worst experience ever had in DC. Do not go there if u dont wanna waste your time/money and be treated poorly., We had a reservation for 9pm on a Saturday night. We showed up on time and they told us the wait would have been 5 mins. After one hour and multiple inquiries, they still were not able to sit us. Eventually, they told us they could give us a community table. At that point, we left. The most annoying thing wasn, surprisingly, the wait, but the attitude of the staff there. The (blonde) girl and the front could not care less about us, and she definitely wasn apologetic. She seemed to care more about chatting with her friends. Never returning here again., Waited over an hour past our reservation to be seated without a single staff member letting us know what was going on or apologizing. When asked, the hostesses kept saying we were next and that there was nothing they could do. The attitude was shocking--it was as though *we* were being rude by checking in on the status. Note to restaurant if you read this: you should apologize if your unpreparedness creates long delays. You should not expect the guests to continue checking in to figure out whether theyl be seated. You should not tell them there is nothing you can do (there is plenty you could do, including knocking off a part of the meal, or at least a drink or two). You should not act as though it is the guests who are insulting you by checking in about when theyl be seated.To those considering a reservation at Lupo Verde: don bother., Great pasta and great house wine. Will definitely be going back. Thanks for the good experience!, Terrible service, which I normally don care about. (should say that our waiter was lovely, once we got seated).My friends and I made a reservation for six people at 9pm on Friday night. We showed up right at 9 and were told to go to the bar and have a drink while we wait because our table was just given their check, and would be about ten minutes. Ok fine. Twenty minutes later we check back in and are told a different table is ours, and it is being cleaned. We start asking for some bread (getting hangry). No luck for about fifteen or twenty minutes more (they did eventually bring (cold) bread and some olives). Fifteen more minutes pass, and when the hostess comes upstairs again we ask her which table is ours. She says let me go check on something and I will be right back - she literally runs down the back stairs to avoid answering us. At 10:05 or so, we meet a woman who is ALSO waiting for a table for her friends who have a reservation for five people at 9pm. We see that one table that would seat either group is finally clearing out. The hostess comes upstairs and my friend asks if the table is ours. Hostess puts her arm around BOTH my friend and the woman from the other group and says of course! We point out there are two distinct groups waiting for this table. She looks concerned and says the manager will have to decide. We finally got seated for our 9pm reservation at 10:15 and frankly I not sure what happened to the other group. The most amazing part is that we had actually mistakenly made TWO reservations for 6 people at 9pm. What would they have done if we actually had two different groups of 6 show up?!The food was pretty good - the pasta was actually very good. And I sure the first weekend of a new restaurant always has scheduling glitches. But the fact that no one offered us anything free (we had to TELL them we would not be paying for the bottle of wine we shared while waiting for our table) does not say good things about the service. I will not be going back for quite some time. Hope they get their service and reservation policy figured out., Ive been to several of the better Italian restaurants in DC. This doesnt quite measure up. We dined here on opening weekend and we wanted it to be better than it was.Pros - Our server helped us choose great wine and cheese (minus the mozzarella, which tasted like it had been dipped in fish). We had a reservation on a crowded Saturday night and were seated within 30 seconds of arriving.Cons - We tried two pasta dishes: the carbonara and the cacio e pepe, plus the fried zucchini. The zucchini was fine, but both pasta dishes missed the mark. The carbonara was bland and oily. Regarding the cacio e pepe (one of my favorite Italian dishes, I recently returned from Rome where I had this several times): Lupo Verdes version tasted like fetuccine alfredo, it lacked the full pepper flavor that makes the dish special and the pasta wasnt al dente--it was mushy. In short, it tasted like a bad American take on Italian food. One other con: The restaurants tables were very squished together and the restaurant was incredibly crowded. If youre expecting an intimate dining experience, this is not the place to go., I LOVE the atmosphere/decor, food, and hospitality at Lupo Verde. Highly recommend the pasta with eggplant. I went back twice in one week - just to have it again! Truly one of a kind pasta dishes. Lupo Verde is perfect for an intimate dinner, or with a group of friends. Bar was friendly and nice to hang out at before and after dinner. Enjoyed the red and white house wines on tap!, Based on several of the other reviews on Yelp, I was a little nervous about trying Lupo Verde. Overall we had a great experience.We were seated promptly and given a choice between a communal table downstairs or a four-top upstairs. We chose to sat upstairs. The restaurant is somewhat compact, but does a good job using the space that they have.The service and food was excellent. Our server made a great wine suggestion (we didnt know a ton about Italian wine). The menu is a mix of small plates, pastas, and larger meat/fish dishes. We did a selection of five meats, two appetizers, a pizza, and four pastas. We found this to be the perfect amount of food for our group. I definitely recommend starting with a few meats/cheeses/or both. Also, the housemade pasta is amazing and you need to try that.We will definitely be back., Fresh new Italian joint on 14th Street = Awesomeness`I went to Lupo Verde last week with a group of friends and was very impressed with my entire experience.  Upon arriving they sat us at the first communal table across from the main bar. It was comfortable and nice to have a high top table because I am tall. At the end of the Bar we could see the two guys in the cheese room, slicing up some fresh cured meat and cheeses. We asked our waitress which ones we should order, and she pointed to a few and we said OK, next thing we know the guys are drinking some good Italian red wine and the ladies are drinking some prosecco they have on tap. We got the Octopus antipasto (which means appetizer in Italian)- it was so so good, like the best I have had, and wait for it, wait for it...served with some Farro- wow amazingly delicious, I didnt know you can make Farro that good, I ate every last grain oh and tentacle for those who are counting! Also had the Apple & Arugula salad, which was served with some freshly sliced cured meat, like prosciutto or one of its cousins yummy, the apple in the salad was also really really good. For dinner we got the squid ink pasta & scallops & the lamb something or other. Let me just say I dont like scallops, but she ordered something with them and well, lets just say, I tried eating all of them, did I mention I dont like scallops because I really dont, but these scallops were not like any scallops I have even seen or tasted, ok yes I have seen scallops, but never in my life have I tasted such deliciousness for something I do not like one bit, BRAVO (well done! in Italian), not sure whats going on in that kitchen but those scallops were so tasty I might not be able to say I don like scallops anymore. The squid ink pasta was so yummy and fresh it was like I was on a boat in the middle of a squid party, yup that kinda party. The Lamb-, well, I am a sucker for lamb, but there is no bias here, this lamb was such a delight for me and after I scarfed it down, I can easily say the lamb was ready for me to eat it, thanks to the chef. * Q: Why couldn the little lamb play outside? A: It was being baaaaaaaad! * no seriously this lamb was really really good, so good it was baaadass, like a lil badass tasty lamb, in lil chunks that couldnt go outside and play because I ate it all and licked my plate. yes I really did lick my plate.  Limoncello` and the other flavors of DC area homemade liquor WOW. So I tried the *Mandarin Orange liquor, it was a dream, like someone had to pinch me after I took a sip, because I passed it around the table and it was all gone by the time the second person got hold of it. I also tried the Walnut one it was robust and walnutty but crisp and ready for someone who wants that. Also tried the Prickly Pear liquor and it was so very good as well. Either way these tasty liquors are a fun way to cap off dinner.Atmosphere = Modish, chic, but rustic and classic, a good fit for the spaceWait Staff = Knowledgeable of the food and drinks, friendly, and just the right amount of attentionI am looking forward to going back, I have a friend coming in town this weekend from Texas, hopefully they will be in the mood for some of this Italian goodness!, The food was good, the seating and service, not so much. To be fair I went on their first opening weekend and things were a bit crazy. The Cons:Some of the seating is family style which meant that we were seated at one table with 6 other people. I dont mind this type of seating normally but the table was too small to comfortable seat everyone. Also the plates and cheese boards they use took up a third of the table and took over part of another persons dining space. I felt very cramped and wasnt able to fully enjoy my meal. Our waitress was very nice but it seemed that she was responsible for every other table on the bottom floor and therefore was very hard to get a hold of. I waited 20 minutes after being seated to be asked for my drink order and then waited another 20 minutes to receive my drink and to have the rest of my order taken. Our main dishes seemed a little cold as if they had been sitting out for awhile before we were served. Also one bathroom for the whole restaurant = long line and it was right next to where the food was being prepped to send out. The Pros:Cheese and meats were absolutely delicious. Presented beautifully (on an extra large board) and paired with the wine very well. The artichoke starter was very good and the main dish of pasta with lamb ragu was also delicious but a tad cold. The interior design of Lupo Verde was nicely done and the Italian wine list was impressive. Not sure if I would go back. I think I would rather go to The Red Hen in Bloomingdale or Osteria Morini in Capitol Riverfront for Italian., A fine addition to 14th Street. Proper Italian from Naples. And proper southern espresso., My friend and I went for drinks and a light bite last night, and werent disappointed! We got a selection of 5 meats/cheeses (you can mix them) for $18, and we each had a glass of wine on tap - they have 3 different ones. The housemade pancetta was amazing, and the others were tasty as well. It was a bit crowded at first (9:45ish on a Thursday), but they were helpful in finding us a table after a few minutes waiting at the bar. We also tried the nutella pizza, which was to die for! We were there so late that the manager and chef both stopped by. I cant wait to go back for a full dinner!, My wife and I had 6:45 reservations on a Friday, and had no problems being seated right away. The hostess did ask if we would mind sitting at a communal table, but didnt push the issue once we declined. We ordered a cheese and meat board to start, which was great. We also each got 2 pasta dishes, which were so damn good. I cant recall the names of all the dishes we got, but I know I had the lasagna, and my wife had the lamb ragu. We also both got a pasta dish with cherry tomatoes, and eggplant. The best of them in my opinion was the lasagna, but I love me some lasagna, so no shocker there. We ended the meal with a coffee/cocoa dessert. Imagine ice cream served in a mug lined with Nutella, with a hint of coffee. My wife couldnt get enough of it.Service was good. Our waiter was on top of things, but didnt make us feel rushed by any means. One of the owners was also making rounds, checking in on tables, and greeting guests. This was nice to see, considering the opening weekend issues everyone is complaining about. The space is SMALL though, and once it got busier, it felt sort of claustrophobic. It seems like terrific addition to the neighborhood, and Im sure well be back. I recommend giving it a shot. It seems like they may have figured their service issue out, and the food is outstanding., Rude, awful, horrible. The promised to seat us in half an hour, which then became an hour and a half, then two and a half hours. Meanwhile we are standing in a crowded place where waiters are pushing past us. Not worth it., Horrible service - blonde waitress was apathetic and unfriendly. When we told her the food was too salty and asked for more bread, she didnt apologize and appeared annoyed. Later came back with more bread and plopped it on the table without saying a word.I usually like community tables but this setup was claustrophobic and the tables were way too small for the amount of people seated at them.Food took over an HOUR after ordering to get to the table and by the time it arrived, it was completely cold, as if it had been sitting in the kitchen long after it had been done.Not coming back., This place is fantastic! The decor is really intimate and cozy, and the food was delicious. Went here recently for a friends birthday and had a great night. For the table, we split a meat and cheese plate, the burrata and a fried artichoke app (they also provide bread for the table). Everything was delicious and the side sauce with the artichoke was so good I couldve had it as a dipping side with the bread!For entrees, I got the lamb ragu which was a-mazing. Others at the table got the steak, pasta dishes and a fish dish that was interestingly prepped at the table. The lamb ragu was definitely my favorite of the pasta dishes, though. Also dont miss the rose prosecco on tap! Definitely looking forward to going back., My wife and I really like our experience last week. If you know and like real Italian food, this is a fantastic spot. New place and with anything new very small improvements, but the 2 most important things are here. Awesome Italian food and great service. Our server knew his stuff and was nice. Check this place out for sure. We will be back., The ambiance on a rainy day could not have been better for dinner - the owners did a fantastic job with the space/decor. The upstairs could be a great choice for a romantic meal. The meat/cheese platter was delicious and the recommended wine pairing were on point. The lasagna could have been an A+ but it came out lukewarm - surprising, considering it is served in a mini lasagna pan which makes you THINK it came right out of the oven. There was no piping hot, crusty cheese which makes me suspicious. In fact, both pasta dishes we ordered had cooled off before they arrived, hence my 3 star rating. The hostesses were lovely and the waiter was great when we had his attention, but we hand a number of tables competing with us., We live on U Street and have been watching as the building was transformed into what is now the new Lupo Verde. We were finally able to get a table, and boy was it worth the wait! The lasagna was amazing, cocktails tasty, space comfy and service engaging. I recommend trying this new neighborhood eatery ASAP!, The food was good but the portions were SUPER SMALL and the plates super overpriced. You definitely do not get your moneys worth here. The inside is nice but they sat us at a table in the second floor next to the staircase which was very uncomfortable. For the prices I would definitely go someplace else., I really liked this place first because the hostess, who admitted the reservation was lost, seated us no problem, even though our fourth hadnt arrived yet and we were very early! How is that for service? The food? It was good. My pasta with lamb was a bit more al dente than I like but it tasted great and was fresh. The menu features pasta names you might not be familiar with, by the time the waiter arrived google handled most of my questions thanks to my awesome BlackBerry 10 browser. The space it tiny, but warmly designed and the prices are very fair too. I was happy to see the food was of better quality than Ulah, the group also own Lupo. Definitely will be back. Still trying to figure out the meaning behind the name though?, Great dinnerService: BClientele / Ambiance: A-Location: A+Price (you get what you pay for): AFood: A (all fresh and homemade)Overall: A-4-3-14, Great experience! We were seated promptly on a Thursday night at 8:00 PM at a perfect table for four upstairs. We had a warm, helpful, and attentive waiter (if I remember correctly, his name was Mark J), who was incredible at describing the dishes, answering our questions, and ensuring that empty glasses were refilled quickly. I really liked the variety of the offerings on the menu---everything looked good. We ordered three antipasto dishes to start---ORDER THE FRIED ARTICHOKES---and we each ordered a main entree. Everything was good, even the glass of red wine I had was wonderful, and the prices were reasonable.I will definitely be going back. This place is great., There were some great things about this place: the ambiance is very nice, the olives were tasty as an appetizer, they have a good list of drink options, they are very close to where I live and who doesnt like a good bowl of pasta! My pasta was ok, I cant even remember what it was called but I liked that it was tossed with artichoke hearts, but I cant honestly say it was memorable. I did get dessert and will say that was memorable in a *bad way*...it was the dessert pizza, I got it because of the nutella and fruit combo, but it tasted like it was on plain pizza bread, strange combination. I think it would be better on a nice flaky croissant or maybe a sweeter, less dense bread-anyhow, I wont getting that again. Another plus, they have gluten free choices so yay for gluten-phobes :), Good Italian food in DC is difficult to find. When I heard news of Lupo Verde opening up in my neighborhood, I was cautiously excited. I go back and forth from DC and Brooklyn frequently and know good Italian food when I taste it.Lupo Verde blew me away. I ordered the special of the day pasta tagliatelle with Neapolitan ragu. Delicious. Pasta was perfect, homemade and cooked al dente. The ragu was delicious and seasoned beautifully. Person I was with had a custom pasta with Parmesan Pecorino and guanciale on top of spaghetti. Also delicious.And service was great. We sat outside so it was cold but they adjusted the heaters to make sure we were comfortable. The owner himself, very friendly, came to our table and greeted us, and made some great suggestions. Out waiter was also really great and was also helpful in making recommendations. Overall, Im excited. Looking at the other reviews here Im dumbfounded as to why its rated lower. Its honestly good food so what more can you ask for?, A bit disorganized. Excellent charcuterie & cheeses. Lamb stew ordered but really should gave been called lamb risotto. Crowded and fun., THE must restaurant bar to visit in DC. After one visit I was enchanted and have become a regular. The chef has taken great pride with an incredible italian cuisine and incomparable italian imported cheeses. They are also making their own local cheese from sheep called Lupetta. But really what makes this restaurant bar more of a difference is its staff. The minute you come in you are greeted with smile after smile and incredible service that feels like you are at your italian grandmothers house even if you are not italian! An at home feel restaurant bar., Pretty good Italian restaurant. Our waitress was knowledgeable and very pleasant. The food was above average for an Italian restaurant in DC. I will definitely go back., We stopped in for dinner on Sunday evening around 6:30, and to our surprise, were able to be seated upstairs immediately without a reservation. The location is great and the space is nice, albeit in that industrial chic kind of way. Regardless, while the second floor is a bit cramped, I think its intimate in a good way.What I found distracting, however, was a consistent vibration under the table. This could have been some kind of HVAC element operating, or something else entirely, but it was slightly irritating, as it went on for the duration of our one-hour meal. Our server was friendly, not overly hovering, but not too distant either. I tried the irregular cut pasta (I cant recall its name) that came with eggplant and cherry tomato. It was good -- a nice portion, cooked to the right consistency, but it lacked seasoning, in my opinion. Id like to go back, perhaps after this place has found its stride. But Id also like to see some more vegetarian options on the menu., I enjoyed my experience at Lupo Verde. While I wasnt blown away by anything in particular, the food was quality and the prices were reasonable. The service was great and the owner came over and introduced himself and asked how our meal was. FoodWe ordered the small octopus and fried artichokes for appetizers. The small octopus was ok - there was more faro than octopus, which was disappointing. But flavor wise, it was tasty. The Fried Artichokes were absolutely delicious. I recommend them to anyone who likes carciofi. We then each had a pasta - I cant speak to everyone elses experience, but the Carbonara was delicious and well priced. The noodles were unique and perfectly cooked, and there was plenty of quancale in my dish (which always makes me happy). For dessert we had limoncello and something I cant recall. In true Italian fashion, they offered to refill our glasses on the house. Always a nice touch.WineWe were able to find quite a few bottles at a reasonable price that we knew from the Puglia and Umbria regions. No complaints on the selection here.AmbianceThis is probably their biggest plus. Its a very good looking restaurant that seems to be always busy. Sit at the bar downstairs or upstairs, it doesnt matter. Its never too packed or too empty. Ill definitely return to Lupo Verde. Worth a try for sure., My boyfriend and I stopped here for dinner one day after work. I did not except it to be as great as it was. We ordered a mixture of meats and cheeses and they waiter was very helpful in the deciding process. I had the carbonara pasta which was yummy and was a very small portion but i felt it was perfect. My boyfriend had the steak and loved it, it was cooked perfectly. We also split a zucchini with egg.. I am not sure was it was called but it was like nothing I have ever had before. It was delicious. The menu had so much to offer. The place was busy for a week night and we did have to wait a little bit but it was definitely worth it! The place is small but the ambiance is wonderful., Great neighborhood restaurant! Carbonara pasta was undercooked (and I like my pasta al dente), but they comped it in the final bill, which was very nice. Pasta with lamb and pork was DELICIOUS, as was our cheese and salami platter. Service was on par, and Ill definitely be going back!!, Id give the food 3 stars, but the service knocks my review down to 2 stars. Our experience started off well...shortly after being seated we had water in our glasses and fresh baked foccacia bread at our table. Our server explained the menu and offered suggestions as to how many dishes to order, and we were on our way to a good meal. We started with the fried artichokes, the tuna carpaccio, and the stuffed panzerotti. Like several other people have said, the fried artichokes were great. You got 2 whole artichoke hearts and steam, fried with a really light batter, and served with an herb and anchovy sauce. The tuna carpaccio was also tasty, and a bit smoky, served with some pickled vegetables and caper berries. There were only 2 small pieces of toast to eat with it, when it could have used 4. It would have been a better ratio of toast to fish. The panzerotti were also tasty. They were like little hot pockets, made with their pizza dough and filled with cured meat, cheese and a bit of tomato sauce.Once we were finished with our antipasti, we were ready for our pastas. But we waited...and waited...and waited...probably a solid 45 minutes - 1 hour. When we asked our server, he said he had 2 people looking for our order. Then one of the managers came over and apologized, saying they just changed their menu that day, and that caused the delay. Im not really sure why that would have caused a 45 minute delay between courses, but that was her excuse. Once our pastas did arrive, we really enjoyed them. We tried the tagliatelle, which had a ragu sauce, along with the squid ink pasta with seafood. Both pastas were cooked al dente, although the tagliatelle was a bit on the thicker side. The ragu was nicely seasoned, and I liked the parmesan crisp that was served with it. The squid ink pasta had a surprising amount of seafood in it; a fairly big head-on shrimp, a huge scallop, about 4 mussels, 4 clams, and a decent sized piece of fish. The saffron broth/sauce was really tasty too.In my past dining experiences, when service has been bad and managers have come to my table, theyve typically offered to comp some portion of the meal, whether its a drink, a dish, or sending over a complimentary dessert. At Lupo Verde, we were left with the managers apology, at that was it. I appreciate that the manager acknowledged the delay in our pastas coming out of the kitchen, I just dont think she did anything to correct the situation. Although the food was good, it may be a while before I return., Oh man, I was really not pleased with this place. I had high hopes that it would be a great addition to the neighborhood but I was painfully disappointed.I was going out for a friends birthday and so we had made a reservation for a big group of people. They werent telling us we had to wait until everyone arrived to sit down, but just awkwardly implied it. We had drinks downstairs at the bar. There werent too many cocktails to choose from and they were pretty pricy. Also, it was annoying that we had to settle the bill for drinks before going upstairs to our table.We were placed all the way in the back. The place was too dark to really see around and it felt unnecessary to have it so poorly lit. Our waiter was very inattentive the whole evening and we waited a long time for each thing that we needed. He also made a comment that implied he was not happy we were ordering drinks with our food, which ft really inappropriate.The food itself was mediocre. I actually liked my meal but most people in my party did not. It was very expensive for very small, infilling portions. We got a desert for the birthday girl, and our waiter charged us for it even though he had said he wasnt going to. He did take it off the bill once we addressed it.I would try this place again in a few months to see if they worked through the kinks. But I unfortunately had a pretty bad time here., The only good things I can say about Lupo Verde are that the space looks good (if not particularly original) and they keep your water constantly filled. Other than that, this was one of the most lackluster places weve eaten at in a looong time.Where to start... Okay, how about the food? We started with the fried artichoke and the impanata. The former tasted like greasy fried dough and the latter tasted like a really bland Hot Pocket. Actually, there are some Hot Pockets that are much better than the impanata and the only redeeming thing about the fried artichoke was the bagna cauda which came with it, though even that tasted like it could have come from a jar...oh well, at least it tasted like something. For our entrees, we had the lamb ragu and the squid ink pasta. Lets get one thing straight - this is NOT lamb ragu. Oh sure, theyll call it that on the menu, but really, its pasta, flavorless red sauce, and little tiny meatballs that are about the size of Kix cereal. The whole thing tastes like a really uninspiring Chef Boyardee meal, but a bit less flavorful and waaay more expensive. The meatballs come across as bland, generic, mystery meat pebbles and the sauce is thin, tepid, wan, and worthless. The squid ink pasta comes in a saffron broth and basically tastes like plain pasta, a mild hint of shellfish, and mild notes of saffron...with the emphasis squarely on MILD. You get one shrimp, one scallop, and (hidden in the noodles) a shelled mussel or two...all for about $20. The only good things I can say about these two thoroughly bland, dull, and uninspiring bowls of pasta is that they do cook the noodles to a wonderfully chewy al dente, but good noodle texture does little to rescue some serious lack of flavor. On the side, my GF ordered a small plate of sauteed zucchini and bell pepper, fried with capers. The dish was swimming in oil and grease and just tasted downright bad. Its like someone decided the correct way to saute half a cup of veggies was in 1 cup of canola oil, and then just dumped everything on a plate and served it. Disgusting is the best word I can think of to describe it.How about the service? Look, I rarely complain about service - I waited tables and bar tended for several years, plus, I dont ask much of a server. As a result, Im pretty forgiving. If you read enough of my reviews, youll rarely see me criticize any place for the service. However, our server at Lupo Verde was terrible. We ordered our drinks before the couple next to us arrived and they were eating their first course before we even had our first drinks. By the time we got our entrees, the two couples on either side of us, both of whom arrived after us, were eating dessert. Look, I dont want a rushed meal, but on a Sunday night, when the upstairs isnt even full and only two people are sitting out the bar, how hard is it to at least get us our drinks in under half an hour? And why should our meal take close to two hours? I dont want a waiter hovering over my shoulder, but not once did our waiter appear to ask if everything was alright with our food after he plopped it down in front of us. He took our order, dropped the food off, and other than that, we never saw him again until he dropped our desert menus in front of us. He didnt even ask if we wanted desert, he just put the menus in front of us and stood there, waiting for us to say something. Lastly, the folks around us got bread without asking, while we had to ask twice. When the check arrived, the guy just put it on the table and walked away. I can deal with unfriendly servers if they are attentive, and to some degree, Ill forgive a very friendly server if the food gets backed up, but an unfriendly server who basically ignores you throughout your meal is just not very good at his job.What else... Oh, the beer selection sucks. Look, I know youre an Italian restaurant, and thus you have to carry some Italian beer, but lets be frank here, Italian beer sucks. How about something more than weak pale lagers? Im also 99% sure that my Toto cocktail was made differently than it was listed, but as it was, I received something that basically tasted like a White Lady, for $12. So, bad service, bad food, bad beer, a dull cocktail, and a bill that came to about $60 each. Ugh...what waste of money., I was very conflicted on what to give this restaurant, either a 3 or 4 star rating. I settled on a 3 because of one dish which might sound petty but it still brings back not so good memories. There is a sardine appetizer on bruschetta that I ordered but fell flat. Firstly, the presentation was not what I expected. I was expecting maybe one or two pieces of bruschetta with nicely fried and thin sardines on top. What I got was one piece of bread with tomatoes on top and pretty big sardines that were soggy. And there was a very fishy taste that made my mouth tingle in a bad way. I thought it was just me but my friend who was with me shared the same feeling to me after we left. I didnt say anything because I didnt want to seem negative and thought it was just me but it was definitely the sardine. Dont get this dish.Everything else was very nice. We had a lamb ragu which was definitely our favorite. I read a few bad reviews for the cheese and meat plate but I disagree, I like the cheese and meat plate. It might be a little pricey but definitely worth it. The drinks were pretty spot on as well. My house wine was definitely on the small side but definitely delicious. We sat outside and the location is great to people watch and just enjoy the day. Unfortunately, for us it was cold outside so we were uncomfortable for a good part of the time. The heat lamps didnt really help that much. Its definitely better when its warmer outside. Besides that, nothing extraordinary. A little pricey but good food with the exception I mentioned. The service was good, I agree with a previous post about the water cup size though. I drink lots of water and that cup was a sip for me. Its annoying to have to keep waiting for water. Next order of water cups should be a bigger size. Just an observation. Oh, another thing is that the drinks took a little longer to get than desired. Overall, definitely not a 5 star place and it would have been a 4 star if it werent for those awful sardines., Lupo serves some damn good Italian. The flavors are so complex, heavy on the herbs, and no corners are cut in terms of ingredient quality. This is a traditional menu, and I can just imagine all the work that goes into each dish.The happy hour crowd was going strong at 7pm. Every meal at Lupo starts with a modest bowl of tomato onion focaccia alongside olive oil and salt. We split the deep-fried artichoke hearts-which were not nearly as impressive as the pesto sauce served with them-and then got our own entrees.I ordered the BRAISED BABY OCTOPUS and the LUPO cocktail of rye, fennel, fennel bitters, and strong tonic, aka the sharp/herby/licorice cocktail of my dreams. All it needed was egg whites. The octopus was served over a wheat berry salad with a balsamic and tiny currants. The microgreens on top added a nice zing with the octopus. And let be real, there should probably have been a little more octopus on this plate. But, I loved the dish and considered the portion massive for a small plate.FULL REVIEW WITH PICS ON THE BLOG: thatumamilife.wordpress.206, My friend and I wandered here on my first night in DC, looking for great wine and food, and a place to chat for awhile. We showed up around 7:30 on a Thursday and were told it would be a 45+ minute wait for a table for two. The hostess suggested we check for bar seating upstairs, and luckily a group was paying out right when we walked up. Slightly annoyingly, though, there were reserved tables upstairs that remained unoccupied for the majority of the time we were there. We were in luck, though, as the bartender was friendly and helpful, and he provided great service throughout our visit. We started with a bottle of the draft red wine -- yes, draft -- which came out colder than expected (the bar says thats because its held next to the chilled draft white), but was delicious otherwise. At the suggestion of the bartender, we ordered a charcuterie platter of prosciutto, bufalo mozzarella, house-made finocchina, salami, and another cheese I cant recall. Everything was absolutely delicious, and the platter was served with bread, peach jam, walnuts, strawberries and honey to bring it all together-- fabulous! Portions werent stingy, either.Next, we shared the statale 268 pizza with mushrooms, eggplant and sausage, as well as a salad with roasted eggplant. Both offered a great combination of fresh and well-seasoned ingredients.Overall a great atmosphere, awesome service, and delicious food and wine!, Four and a half stars. Rounded up.I must have come to this place a dozen times since it opened, sometimes for a solitary dinner at the bar, other times with a loud group of friends and even on one occasion with my grandmother. First, the bad: this place can get damn noisy. Also, while to cocktails are mighty good, they are overpriced.With that aside, I glad to have this place a few blocks away from my apartment. The cooking is on point--classically southern Italian in origins with a little bit of experimenting going on but not so much as to be in anyways distracting. The fish preparations are stellar, particularly the Branzino which the wait staff handsomely fillet at your table side.Pastas are a fine alternative--high marks to the piquant and creamy rendition of cacio & pepe, the hearty carbonara and the lighter maltagliati. Be forewarned that while the striglie with lamb ragu is robust but overly salty.Lupo changes the menu based on the season. While I in no rush for a return to cold weather just yet, I await when they put winter dishes like the rich and filling polenta appetizer back on the menu (it substantive enough for a main course).Speaking of appetizers, don skip the cheese and charcuterie; the mortadella and house made speck were phenomenal with the latter having unusual but welcome undertones of nuttiness., Lupo Verde does a very good job at bringing the Italian food philosophy to the District. Originally, I went without a reservation on a Friday and was seated within minutes (which is not the norm, dont do what I did). They have a good selection of cheeses and meats to start. Good wine (cheap and good stuff on tap as well). The focaccia to start was amazing. Then again, I love anything with copious amounts of olive oil in it. The pastas were fresh but not necessarily memorable (really, I cant remember what I had there. Its been a while). We also had one of the pizzas which was good but not the best. Although we ordered the saut39ed vegetables as a side dish and when it came it was exactly same as the topping on the pizza. Now thats cost effectiveness! The service was average to poor. We got seated quickly but I felt like the waiter often ignored us and, because were relatively young (on a scale of 1 to 100 years old) didnt take us seriously. Despite this, I enjoyed the meal and will be back., I left Lupo Verde feeling disappointed. The space is very cool, but the food was just not very memorable. Yes, the fried artichokes were tasty but the pasta was the real letdown. The first sign of trouble was that my friend and I had to wait an HOUR for our pasta (not an exaggeration) after we finished our appetizers.No one seemed to care that it was taking a long time until we asked our waiter where the pasta was (after waiting about 45 minutes) and then a manager came over and explained that there were problems in the kitchen. She offered us an appetizer but said that our food would be out in 5 minutes anyway. I appreciated the gesture, but whats the point of offering something that would just go to waste and arrive after our pasta? And then in reality we waited another 15 minutes for the pasta, not 5 like promised. If the tagliatelle and squid ink pasta had been awesome, I would have forgiven the kitchen for the delay. Unfortunately, they just werent that great and seemed to be under-cooked (yes, I know what al dente is and they were NOT al dente)., The food is AMAZING. Ill start by saying that. Went here with a group of 5; we had a reservation so we were seated. They do group tables there so we shared our table with another group of 3 people. That was fine but the table was slightly cramped. Also, the bar area right behind our table got PACKED, adding to the crowded factor. Service was a little slow, I think due to it being difficult to navigate thru the restaurant. But the food was excellent. Really, really good. All the pastas are handmade and just really delicious. Our waiter was slightly unconventional in his recommendations in that he never gave his opinion or told us what other customers enjoyed--he just said everything is good and it depends what you like. Couldnt tell us which of two dishes is better, didnt recommend anything in particular. Would I go back? If I had a reservation. But it seems to be one of those places that youll wait FOREVERRRRR and Im not into that, I went with a big group for a friends birthday dinner and the whole experience was great. I told them what the occasion was ahead of time and the waitress (wish I remembered her name!) was great about making us/the bday girl feel special. The restaurant isnt huge despite being two levels (plus a nice patio) but they gave us a great table upstairs. The waitress was really helpful with suggesting apps to split/answering questions about the menu, and she was fully attentive the entire time. We all loved our food and had a great time - definitely would go back! Ps. you can get carafes of wine on tap so thats always a plus!, Attended Lupo Verde with a group of 8 girls for a birthday dinner. Our waitress was fabulous, and helped recommend appetizers for the table to share, along with what wine would pair best with the foods we were ordering.The food is delicious and reasonably priced for the high quality that it is. Handmade fresh pastas, wood fired pizzas, fresh bread, and unique vegetable dishes were just a few of the items our table tried. Additionally, the atmosphere is fabulous- the two floors of Lupo Verde are intimate and warm, and they have a nice outdoor patio. They did a great job with our large group, but the rest of the restaurant seemed to be smaller tables. Lupo Verde is a must-try on 14th street and would be the perfect date-night restaurant! Ill definitely be returning and would highly recommend this place to anyone., Im gonna go with good & solid as a description. Had no real complaints and it has a lot going for it...particularly the building itself, which i thought was pretty beautiful and interesting. The food itself was good, but wasnt blown away. Wine was fine. Service decent. We sat at the upstairs bar which was very crowded. Overall, worth a try if you like Italian and that area...though with so many options coming in recently id rank it behind Posto, Ghibellina, Etto & M Cafe. Not by far though., I give this place three stars because the food was quite good--I had the branzini--but the service was not what I would expect from a four star restaurant. Our waiter repeatedly forgot to bring out our bread, the food took over 45 minutes to come out, and we were charged 8 dollars for fried dough that was offered as though it was complementary., I made reservations a week ago at Lupo Verde for my weekly dinner with the girls.. and more so because this is a restaurant belonging to someone who lives in Fairlington ... we had seen them advertise on the Fairlington Appreciation Society Page. I walked in today at 6:11 (my reservations were at 6:15). I was rudely told I was early. I said uhhm 4 mins but Id wait (the place was empty except for a few people at the bar). I asked for a seat at the high tops downstairs and was told we have a table for your outside.. I made it clear that I DID NOT ask for neither did I was a table outside and was treated as if this was a massive inconvenience for the restaurant. I was finally seated upstairs. I have to say this introduction to a restaurant with incredibly rude and uppity hostesses did not bode well. Needless to say it took a lot to keep my mouth shut. I was then escorted upstairs to be seated. At the onset - the space is lovely. And we had a great waiter - Abdel - who did his best to make up for the restaurants shortcomings. In a nutshell - any place that can screw up cacio e pepe ...well heck really? I sent it back - the pasta was gooey and the rest of it pretty tasteless... no pepper to speak of and cheese on gooey pasta. The food was meh as was the wine list - younger wines at ridiculous prices - wines that I as a sommelier found rather unimaginative. The cod was not a traditional baccala - this was not dried and salted... more fresh with a salt sear on top. tasteless and sort of bland. The one good thing - reasonably so albeit nothing spectacular- were the appetizer artichokes... and the tomato salad albeit kinda hard to screw up a salad. Disappointed and overpriced...not to be repeated. Perhaps if I am thirsty and need a drink desperately., This is our first time to have dinner at this new place to celebrate my partners bday. We had drinks at the bar while waiting for our table outside. The Ugo cocktail is smooth. Waitstaff is friendly, attentive and brisk. Ann Marie knew her menu well, provided good recommendations and gave us the run down on their Calabrian Chef. The octopus was fantastic, as well as the fried artichoke with veggie dip hinted with anchovies. The carpaccio was very good. The bread is home made and came with olive oil and salt on the side. The artichoke was on the house from the chef because the lamb stew took a while to come out of the kitchen - it was so worth the wait. The strialatalli al nero with sea food had all the rich flavors but not overpowering. This definitely elevates the taste palate for Italian food in the neighborhood. For the price, it is worth coming back. Grazie!, Meat and cheese- such a simple concept yet so phenomenally executed that all the others dishes then had to live up to our high expectations. Luckily, the artichoke appetizer certainly did! The staff was amazingly down to earth and attentive. Well be back soon!, I really wanted to love Lupo Verde but sadly I barely liked it.It has so much potential - the vibe is great and they did a great job with the decor. The service was OK but nothing special. Started strong but once it got busy, forget about getting any attention. The bus boy worked extremely hard to keep our water filled but getting a re-fill on bread or re-fills on drinks was brutally hard.The menu itself is pretty big for what I thought was going to be a more speciality focused Italian restaurant.It always makes me nervous when a small restaurant with good but not great reviews is trying to do much with a menu. My hunch was confirmed.The fried artichokes were SOAKED with oil. Sure, it fried. But there are delicate ways to fry certain things and when the plate is just a pool of grease in which the item is bathing in - meh. The pasta dishes are TINY. And for $16-$18, I would rather pay $12-14 for that size pasta dish and order an entree. But they don have half portions and when the waitress described it as a full portion, I thought we would be ok. One word describes basically all of the food here: SALTY. I mean really heavy on the salt. And I love salt and not even that sensitive to it. The dessert was a sad attempt at some sorta of frozen tiramisu type thing served in awkard coffee mug - it was pretty bad.I will say the foccaia is pretty tasty but again VERY salty and oily., Lupo Verde has a lot going for it: prime real estate on the corner of 14th and T, great people watching from the outdoor patio, and a menu that features both classic and innovative Italian dishes with a focus on pastas made in house and cured meats. However, after coming here for brunch with the BF, its clear that the restaurant has a few kinks it still needs to work out.What we liked:-Enjoyed sitting outside, being able to people watch on 14th Street.-Cocktails were on point (my Spritz was delicious).-The Spaghetti Carbonara was really good, despite being a little salty, but the house made pasta really sold the dish.-Maltagliati alla Norma (wide noodles with ricotta, eggplant, and tomato) was also pretty solid.-Manager was really good about making sure we were enjoying ourselves and definitely made us feel welcome and special.What we didnt like:-Service was really slow, especially the cocktails. They came out at the same time as our entrees due to the bar being backed up.-Portions were rather small.-No olive oil or butter for the bread (not that we needed it but it would have been nice).-It was rather expensive for what we had (two coffees, two cocktails, two pastas, at just shy of $70 for the two of us), and the bill suggested a gratuity of 25%. Thats ballsy.Overall, Im sure that this would be a great place to grab a drink and some light bar snacks during the week. I think they still have a long way to go in terms of living up to their concept. You can definitely find better Italian in the neighborhood and in DC, but the space is nice and I think if they fix their flaws they could really become a core part of the 14th street scene., Good food, good wine, good service. Still - totally overpriced. almost $60 for pasta, wine, and a shared appetizer., I had been really excited about going to Lupo Verde since it opened. Location, style and layout are really on point. We had a 9 PM reservation on a Thursday night and were seated on the patio early. We ordered glasses of the pinot grigio on draft and were mildly surprised that they came in the same glasses that the water did. At first we didnt mind, other than the small portion, because it tasted quite good, but when the bus boy poured water into our wine glasses not once but TWICE, we were not too thrilled. We even said something to him and he just shrugged. We suggested to the waitress that perhaps serving white wine in the same glasses as water isnt the best idea and she brushed it off. After we told the waitress about the issue she brought out another glass of wine on the house, but it took a good 20 minutes. We ordered the Arancia salad which was a decent size and delicious. For entrees we had the Gemelli Cacio & Pepe and the Risotto of the day. I agree with other reviewers that for the price, the portions are a little on the small side. The Gemelli was nothing to write home about and pretty small. The risotto was very good, and a little larger, but for something that had no protein in it, I found it a little ridiculous that market price would be 26 bucks. I would have liked to have given them four stars, but the price of the food and the lack of service knocked it down to three. I will also note that the manager was out on the patio asking all of the tables how everything was - except for us - what gives? I will be visiting Ghibellina, Etto, Posto and Floriana until Lupo Verde gets things running a little tighter., My first visit to Lupo Verde may have been the last. The very basic customer service at this establishment simply leaves a lot to be desired. When I walk into a restaurant, I am expecting to be greeted and feel welcome. Obviously, this was not the case, I just could not stand the experience, I walked out., Man I really love this place. Its a perfect cozy Italian spot on the bustle of 14th street restaurants. The new-ish outdoor patio is perfect for a summer dinner, with lanterns and candles and a great people-watching set up- just be prepared to wait at least an hour for an outside table even on a Sunday night! Definitely recommend the lamb ragu and house-made limoncello dessert., The food is fantastic: the homemade pasta with lamb ragu will blow your mind. But the service???Whats up with those clowns downstairs pretending to bartend? I mean I get the meaning of Italian charm but I need service not a clown showing off his over-gelled hair and the rose on the shirt. Bluh! And it is OVERpriced!! Hope their manager reads the consistent bad reviews about the service and does something about it. Until then, there are plenty of better spots on that strip.
37|makoto-restaurant-washington|The decor and food at Makota is wonderful. The fish is top rate and the chef/kitchen is accomplished at the preparation. I made resrvations about 10 days in advance. Sometimes you have to make reservations further out, sometimes you can get them sooner. Tip: Sit at the sushi bar. The chairs at the tables are small wooden boxes which are sized for a 5ft tall person. If you are taller or prefer any type of back support then siting at a table can be very uncomfortable. (ouch!), According to Zagat, this is THE highest rated Japanese food in all of DC. With that in mind, I woulde expected something very grand or fancy, but it a teeny tiny box of a restaurant in a semi-random location; and after taking off your shoes to enter, youl find yourself sitting on a teeny tiny wooden box. Tiny and boxy are the themes.We went omakase (which Ie been told means entrust or protect). I thought it meant do as you will, which is basically what they do anyway. You do get a couple choices in there, so even the less adventurous ones can do fine with their omakase. They definitely get inventive with their food, doing interesting things like encrusting crab in a rice cracker shell and including ingredients like melons in the mix. While those dishes were good, my favorites were the fresh sashimi (did they just pull mine out of the water?) and the hot meat plates. Each course is just a few bites, so my big eating man was afraid he would still be hungry. Surprisingly enough, all those bites added up to a really satisfying meal. He didn need to grab a slice of pizza afterward after all. While I don know if I would agree that this is THE best Japanese, it definitely up there and worth a visit., The most authentic Japanese meal I have ever had. Delicious from start to finish, combined with service that makes you feel like a GOD. You never want for anything; the servers are the most attentive I have ever encountered. I recommend the omikase... choose the beef over the whitefish and upgrade to Toro for the sushi course. For myself, this was the ultimate Japanese dining experience. If you ever find yourself in Washington, D.C. and need to impress someone, take them to Makoto. You wont be disappointed., Every time a magazine or dc-ites talk about the best restaurants Makoto always gets included. So, I was expecting some sort of chi chi place with elaborate paintings and sculpture. Instead, I found a simply appointed restaurant. Maybe even too bareYou have to look carefully for the entrance. Once you are in, you pass through curtains and down a hallway with a stone floor. Be sure to wear nice socks, because youl be asked to take your shoes off. Don worry because they will give you some slippers. The restaurant itself is really small. Put your purse or cell phone in the wooden box chair.Order the set menu -- it is fifty bucks but youl get a ton of food which is a good thing because the portions are on the small side. With the set menu, you will start off with mussel soup. Then, the stuff keeps coming with salmon, garlic and shrimp, noodles and more., I have always loved this place. I hope it is still as great as it was when I was in college. This place single handedly got me off of hot sake and onto a full blown sake addiction. The tasting menu is phenominal, always., Edit 3/08 - Makoto has an amazing $16 lunch box special! Many Japanese restaurants in the DC area claim to be authentic, but this is the only restaurant Ie seen that truly lives up to that expectation. Magazines, newspapers and best of lists always mention Makoto as one of the best restaurants in DC - and many will agree - but you wouldn be able to tell, at least based on the humble size of the dining area and minimalist decor.The food, however, is nothing but humble or minimalistic. With a 9- to 10-course chef tasting menu that changes daily, expect to see some Japanese staples (sashimi, of course) as well as some carefully crafted, unique dishes - all delicious and mouthwatering as the one before. The staff contribute to the authenticity of this Japanese restaurant by speaking to the diners in Japanese (as well as English, of course). The servers are more attentive than any other Ie seen - due partially to the small number of tables - and especially helpful in describing the seemingly indescribable dishes in front of you. Don be fooled by the price range ratings. Considering the numerous courses that keep coming one after another, it a good value. Expect to leave with a full stomach and no regrets after you pay that bill.Those who enjoy simplicity, elegance and authenticity in their dining experience - as well as those who are willing to try new (and often raw) foods - will love Makoto. Special occasions for small parties (no more than 4 will fit comfortably) will be extra special at this restaurant.Make reservations., from what i know about japanese cuisine, this follows a pretty traditional japanese restaurant meal structure. though they have a la carte, it seems that most people go with the $49 omakase meal. the dishes change all the time, though the types of courses (sashimi, soba, sushi, etc.) tend to stay the same. you get a little choice for your meats/fish, but in general its up to the chef. some courses fell a little flat, but overall it was a great experience with some delicious courses. the tuna sashimi was about as fresh as it gets, and the soft-shell crab with rice cracker crust was wonderful. the last course, a grape sorbet with grand marnier, topped off a great meal. definitely try this place out once.its in the fucking palisades though..., Makoto is a very special Japanese restaurant that is unlike any other in the area. Their entrance sits in the middle of another Japanese restaurants front yard. With the entire restaurant underground, their door at the ground level is the only thing youll see from the street. It reminded me of a door from a Japanese cartoon that allows you to travel to anywhere in the world by walking through it. Unless you were looking for Makoto, you wouldnt know that there was a premium Japanese restaurant there.After going down the stairs to the underground, there is another door, which leads you to their staging area, where you are required to take your shoes off and wear a pair of slippers. Finally, you enter their small dining area, which is entirely made of light colored wood. SEATS: About 4 tables that seats four adults (could be split to make tables for two). The long counter seats 10-12 people (best seats). On the other side of the counter is the kitchen where the floor is lower like a baseball dugout. The difference in elevation allows you to peek to see the talented cooks at work; at the same time, it serves the purpose of keeping the employees lower than the customers, which is a Japanese manner that indicates that the customers are always at the higher status than the workers.ATMOSPHERE: The decor is beautiful, not like The Dining Room at Ritz, but in a small Japanese underground restaurant way. It feels like you are no longer in the U.S. While proper attire is required, the place feels casual, so you may not want to wear your tie. Many people did not wear a jacket. FOOD: You must try their $49 chefs course. What a deal! Whatever you do, dont come here mainly to eat sushi. Take a close look at the three chefs in the kitchen and identify the master chef. Youll notice that he never goes near the sushi counter, which is at the corner of the kitchen. He lets one of the younger chef make the sushi, which was pretty good, but outshined by the rest of their prepared food. Each course is small, but when I finished my final course, I was full. Omakase means you leave it to the chef, so you dont get to choose what you want, except they let you choose the 8th course (main dish). On the day I went, choices were orange roughy, yellow tail, salmon, and beef steak. We also chose the topping on the soba noodles. Menu clearly states that they use all natural flavors and no preservatives, so you know they dont use MSG. Omakase Course (menu changes daily):1st: Grilled shrimp, scallops, and shitake2nd: Green veggi and yamakurage3rd: Sashimi4th: Soft shell crab5th: Roll cabbage6th: Clam with garlic sauce and crab meat wrapped in cucumber7th: Nigiri sushi (3 pieces)8th: Main dish (choices of fish, beef, etc.)9th: Soba (several options)10th: Dessert, homemade sherbetPRICE: $49 Chefs course$15 Sake$20 Taxes and tip--------------$90 Total per person.OTHER NOTES: Reservation is required. There is no need to pre-order chefs course. Street parking was relatively easy., A hidden gem of a restaurant tucked into a small basement on a quiet neighborhood block. The decor is sleek, traditional Japanese with natural woods and the ambience elegant. You will be required to put on slippers before entering the dining room which is tiny and intimate. The chefs tasting menu is excellent with a variety of market fresh ingredients and flavors. Sit at the sushi bar to watch the food being prepared by the master chef., This place is pretentious. Among good restaurants, some pride themselves in catering and adjusting to customers needs and wants. Others serve what they think is good and expect you to like it. This place is definitely the latter. They also require formal attire.We had the $60 omakase 10-course dinner. You are not supposed to make requests or even ask questions about what is going to be in it. The course was the same for everyone for the night as far as we could tell, so I dont know why they cant tell you the menu in advance. Two of the dishes were Sushi and sashimi, and they were very good. Tuna and hamachi were delicious. The rest of the dishes were, well, regular Japanese home-style cooking, but presented in fancy and pretentious ways. They were cooked well and tasted fine, but not mind blowing. Like, they were something my mother would make, not something you pay a good amount of money for. This might be why I was the only Japanese-speaking customer out of ~20 diners that night.I highly recommend this place if sushi was the only Japanese food youve had. The course gives you a nice sampling of a variety of common Japanese cuisine. Otherwise, Im not sure if its worth the price., This was the ultimate dining experience. One I will unlikely forget. I ate food that I would have never thought would come near my mouth in 1000years. And I loved every bite of it! So tasty and healthy. I felt like I was in Japan...or what I imagine Japan to be like since Ive never been there. But I was overall super pleased. If youre there alone or with one other person, be sure to sit at the bar. It was fun watching the chef hard at work., Fantastic.This is one of our special occasion places - birthdays, etc.It was a great place to take a couple wee friends with, who both love sushi, for a wedding present. Pricey, though - our bill for four was about $350. Definitely NOT something we can do every month, but very, very worth it!As others have said, it a tiny space, reservations are a must. And you have a 2-hour window, so plan ahead accordingly. Even getting there 20 minutes late (as we did once) allowed us enough time to do the Chef menu, but I wouldn suggest dawdling over it if you are late.Utterly fantastic. Some of the things they do with food have simply blown us away each time we eat there. And sure, the portions are small - it a 9 or 10 course meal!Strong recommendation if you want amazing service, terrific Japanese food, and a memorable dining experience.The box seats, however, are certainly not high on the comfort scale. But my wife has put her purse in one once, so there that..., A small, traditional-style Japanese restaurant with somewhat pricey dishes and really great food.Not much to add that wasn in Toro E. review of this place, except to note that the price of the fixed-menu dinner seems to have gone up from $50 to $60. We ordered this, and the food was just as Toro E. described. The main dish we chose was beef grilled in a buttery mushroom sauce, which was excellent.I confused about Takaki K. comments on the service here... did he have a bad waiter? Our waiters were all polite and helpful; when I asked about what courses would be included in the omakase, our main waitress listed all the courses in order, and she was happy to allow my Dad to make substitutions on his sashimi course (for a bit extra he got some sea urchin and fatty tuna). One of the waitresses was Chinese and sometimes had trouble understanding my English, which I guess could have been misinterpreted as a you-shouldn-ask-questions attitude., Great kaiseki. Nice small place. Yes, it is pricy, but you get a satisfaction of going to a special place. Food is very nice. The presentation is nice, tasty and delicately served. This is close to being in a good Japanese restaruant IN JAPAN. You will never be able to eat this in Japan with this price.If you think you like Japanese food, go there with one of two special people who are willing to try what the chef serves you as it is, and enjoy the ultimate Japanese dinning. You will learn a lot about the depth of Japanese food., Beautiful, comforting, minimalist restaurant. Many Americans will find my comfort in the Japanese style minimalism a little off...but it was perfect. It could also have been the company. Had a wonderful, loooong dinner (2.5 hours) with a good friend that I haven seen in over a year. 10 courses of savory dishes. We splurged and upgraded to the fatty tuna and fatty yellowtail for the sashimi course. Wine list very small and ridiculously overpriced...the cheapest bottle of white was $80 and it was a Mondavi Chardonnay 2004. So we shared a half bottle of sake which is the equivalent of 200 mL probably. $35...can remember which one but it was the premium cold sake option. I particularly enjoyed the deep fried soft shell crab crusted with rice crackers. Service was impeccable. Not once did I have to ask for anything. Only downside: they only serve bottled Evian water. A and I went through at least 5 bottles of water over the course of 3 hours. I thought all restaurants had to serve tap water if requested. The waitstaff said only Evian. Is this against the law? Caution: Very, very expensive. Our bill was $240 not including tip, for 2 people., What an extraordinary restaurant. Every dish is perfect.I not going to list all the dishes served because there were many and the menu constantly changes. I chose the chef choice which consists of many small cooked, and some raw dishes plates, seperately I ordered fourteen pieces of sushi.You can always tell quality sushi by a restaurant uni and ikura. Makoto uni has excellent taste with a strong San Diego game flavor. Ikura is marinated in-house. Neither needs a quail egg to balance out or accompany the flavors. Fatty tuna melts in your mouth and tastes like a combination of beef fat and Grade A toro. Their in house marinated saba has a strong wood taste if you can imagine. Some advice, ask your server, or if youe sitting at the counter, the cook when he gets a break, if there is any fish being stored that is not listed on their daily menu. I found two. Saba and aji. Both of them delicious.Cooked dishes are amazing as well. An example was my steak with mushrooms. The steak was rare, lean and melted in myr mouth like butter.. The mushrooms (I don know what kind) were firm and had a strong woodsy and earthy taste. Another beef dish is the rare roast beef topped with home made wasabi. Their wasabi alone is worth the price of admission. I can only describe it as a chunky type of horseradish with oil and salt.Sake is well stocked. I had the nigori which has the consistency of soupy oatmeal and is complex in flavors.Desert consisted of a delicious Grand Marnier sherbet. Shaved ice with Grand Marnier poured in. Simple and effective. . A few things to take note of. Make reservations early. Makoto only seats thirty. Counter, tables and all. You must wear a dress shirt., at the least a nice polo. Don worry about footwear since you have to take your shoes off anyway. Finally, don be thrown off by the pretentious attitude of the hostess. I have to admit she was pissing me off before I even stepped inside. She reminded me more of a club doorman picking and choosing who gets inside rather than a hostess. After I finished dinner I understood her demeanor. Makoto is a small and popular place,l the staff work very hard to make your dining experience memorable, hence they don need any guff. When you check the sushi you want off the list remember that 1 means two pieces. I put down 2 next to several and was told I orderd four pieces each. Finally, Makoto is not a sushi place it a Japanese restaurant which serves excellent sushi.NOTE: Try Makoto ume-shiso roll. It the best Ie had., or maybe 3.5 stars.... i read all the reveiws and everyone seemed to love it so much. my bf loves sushi so i took him there for his bday. He loved the place. but i was a little disappointed. we did the tasting menu which is basically 8 courses of different things. I didnt think that the food was worth the money. the bill came out to $220 (not including tip) for 2 people. the tasting menu is pretty much set depending on what the kitchen has available. Maybe i just got unlucky, i dunno. the saki was pretty darn tasty though. This place is SMALLLLLL. you have to be dressed up but its like a closet when you walk in. the service was really great though although the waitresses didnt really seem to understand everything we were saying and it was hard to understand them., I went to Makoto last night to celebrate my parents37th wedding anniversary and I found this to be the perfect place to go on such a special occasion. They had just gotten back from a trip to Japan and praised Makoto for its authenticity and trueness to Japanese cuisine. Makoto is easy to find and there is ample street parking but you need a car to get there and definitely make a reservation. Makoto is small so is good only for parties up to 4 people but someone put good thought into the design of this place that everyone can fit with ample room. The service here is excellent...kudos to the chefs and servers who anticipate your every request and barely make you have to lift a finger.We all opted for the dinner choice menu, which is $60 a person and runs about 10 tasting dishes. The dishes can change depending on what the chef feels like serving. In no particular order, our dishes included sashimi, mussel soup, crab salad with wonton crackers, ngiri, a shrimp and vegetable plate, soba noodles, an entre (tenderloin steak, orange roughy, or yellowtail), sizzling beef and seafood, a cranberry and Grand Marnier dessert, and I sure I missing one or two more dishes. Everything was delicious and of perfect proportion. You fill up more because of the time it takes to eat 10 dishes not because of the quantity of food.This is definitely a special occasion restaurant and not for folks who don eat raw fish and/or only want to eat sushi rolls. This is a true Japanese dining experience., Makoto is quite charming. They really preserve the Japanese style of cuisine in their dishes. They don try to do the Pan-Asian cuisine or tweak their menu to suit American palette. All in all excellent food and service...just wear socks when you eat there as you have to wear the community slippers., Went here for my birthday. I wasnt paying, thank goodness, because you really need to be prepared to drop a weeks rent -- or more -- on dinner here. Definitely worth the hype, though. We all had the 10-course chefs menu. The first thing course was seafood soup, which arrived in a conch shell, on a bed of sea salt, aside a flaming ball of blue goo. That was it for pretention, however. Other were more simple: sushi, sashimi, encrusted soft-shell crab, yellow tail, squid in a mustard sauce, and veggies in an excellent sesame sauce. I highly recommend this place, although the wine was ridiculously overpriced., Want to fall in love? I mean like all the way in love? EAT HERE! It was my best friends birthday and she loves sushi...So we came here with no set intentions, just interested in why it was rated as one of the top sushi restaurants in D.C.. It turned out to be one of the best experience we have ever encountered in reference to food. We ordered the 10 course dinner, which was exquisite. The muscles were so fresh and tasty. The sashimi was incredible. We ordered more after we finished our 10 course meal ;).. Thats how good it was. We had enough sake to probably feed a small village, but the ladies would not stop serving us.. Oh and the service was excellent also. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a hostess who immediately advised me to to take off my shoes and turn off my phone. We were quickly ushered to our table and catered to the entire time. Overall, this was a great experience and I cant wait to come back. We spent in the range of $200-250, but it was well worth it., Last Sunday night, my husbands boss and wife took us out to dinner at Makoto. Ive heard many many things about this place so of course I was dying to try it out for myself! However, we quickly realized that this place requird some getting used to. We entered the small foyer where we were told to take off our shoes and put on some slippers they provided... but from reading the reviews, I knew this and was ready for it except that I was wearing peeptoes and wasnt wearing any stockings so Ms. Head Waitress yells at me to put on those try on stockings they have at shoe stores??? omg... was not happy about this...that was not the end of it either...my hubby was told that he could not come in cause his awesome looking sweater I got him from Neimans did not have a collar! omg...give me a freakin break lady... he looks more dressed up than any of these jokers in washed out J Crew collar shirts...what eves...anyway story goes on... (he ended up wearing a jacket all night) We were suppose to get our table but since the table before us did not leave yet, we were told to wait at the bar.... Remember the Seinfeld episode, The Soup Nazi???? omg..I was so living this episode...but maybe a notch up... I felt so restricted in this tiny little place of a restaurant, I dont think I could breathe...Soon after we moved to our table, things improved drastically. I think we ordered about $300 worth of sushi....and two of us had the 10 course fixed meal, which was basically eat whatever I give you...surprisingly..everything was spectacular... i loved all the courses, some of my faves were the mussel soup, softshell crab with rice crackers, and the perfectly done seabass. Once you taste the food, youll deal with whatever ...I know I did ...even the tacky one time use stockings that were on my feet the entire dinner...You will too...try it out!, As per the recommendation of fellow yelpers, I also got the Omakase, which did not disappoint. Service was prompt, but I often struggled to discern what exactly our waitress was saying. But its cool: food is food anyway you serve it. As Im a dessert guy, one of my favorite parts of the meal was the dessert, which was this sort of green tea sorbet-ish dish, that served as the perfect palate cleanser. The dessert was worth the trip alone. If you take a taxi cab there, be sure to get the number of a cab company for the return trip because this place is located near the Gtown reservoir, which is not too heavily trafficked by cabs. I came back into the restaurant after having realized this to ask for them to call a cab, still wearing my flip-flops, and was consequently cussed out for wearing them inside. However, despite this faux pas, they were still helpful and ordered a cab., intimate atmosphere (meaning small but genuine)... the shoes come off... you can choose to sit at a table or the sushi bar... the quality of the ingredients is unrivaled... try the sea urchin (and bring your credit card b/c you are going to keep ordering food... its too good to stop). be sure to drive or have your waitress call a cab 15 minutes before you are ready to leave., I grew up in DC, have lived in Tokyo and now reside in Hawaii and the SF Bay Area. Wherever I go, I always attempt to seek out the BEST Japanese restaurants. Whether it be Kyoto or Paris. This past February I was in DC for a family reunion and found a lot of positive reviews on Makoto. I was not disappointed. I liked everything about it. Its location in a semi-residential neighborhood, its strange Middle Earth facade, its crowded narrow interior, but most of all the quality and authenticity of its food. Expensive and worth it. Dont go there if you want large American portions. I got lucky on the street parking., I was invited to come to DC to celebrate my birthday and to go to one of the top restaurant in DC. Who would ever say no to an offer like that? Finding the restaurant could have been difficult considering it was the evening and it doesnt stick out as well as you would have wanted.Get in and take off your shoes otherwise the delightful yet stern hostess will kick you out. Recommendations on attire: dont wear a suit as you will come out of the place smelling like smoke and you will have to dry clean that bad boy.Sit down and you realize its a very intimate environment. Very cliche Japanese decor but it works. Order a beer as the wine list is ok and ridiculously expensive. Recommendation: Kirin Ichiban $8.50 for what looked like a 20-24oz bottle.We ordered the dinner course meal which consisted of 8-10 small dishes, following a course that was laid out in the menu. Some of the dishes like the sushi and sashimi are selected by the chef so be prepared for surprises!The courses were amazing! Top dishes included: 1) grilled Chilean Sea Bass, 2) pickled cabbage, picimin with sesame hummus, and salmon with spicy mayo, and 3) Avocado with Miso sauce.All in all, a wonderful evening with someone I love dearly, a great lineup of dishes, cute atmosphere, and comfortable slippers. Highly recommend!, Il keep my review simple: this place is freakinawesome! The best Japanese meal Ie ever had. This place is not a sushi place, although a couple of the courses include sushi. You have to try the Omakase (tasting menu) with the toro and fatty yellowtail upgrade. I really wish I had gotten the Kobe beef upgrade - next time. Not a bad price for the quality of the food (about $100/person)., Heaven! Lunch is a great deal, if you are craving Makoto, but do not want to splurge on dinner. You will still need a reservation for lunch, so you have to plan ahead a little bit., Theres little to add that someone else didnt cover. I thought the omikase was a steal, but we moved here from NYC where the same experience would have cost $120 a head. I agree with another reviewer about the presentation... everything from the folded paper coaster to the shape of the plates was so appealing to the eye. It was so nice to eat somewhere that was truly a culinary treat.As soon as they seat you, they make you put your purse/coats in the cubby of the bench stool. There just isnt any room for extraneous clutter. I did hear someone get scolded for using their cell phone. I was too scared to use mine to take pictures of the food! Some guy did get seated in jeans, which pissed off my husband, who bothered to wear a jacket. Wear shoes that are easy to take on or off, and know that your hair and clothes will absorb a lot of food odor because of the small space. It aired out overnight, but I could smell it strongly the rest of the night., We went to Makoto for my husband birthday last weekend. What a treat! We traveled to Japan 2 years ago, and it was incredibly reminiscent of the cuisine and service we had in Japan. We had the omikase as well. For all that we got, it was a great deal!The service staff are incredibly attentive, and offer great service. Meals are supposed to be a 2 hour service, ahd they do make sure you are in and out in 2 hours since it such a small place.1st course: mussels in rich smoky broth. very delicious--I could probably drink several cups of this!2nd course: 3 apps-persimmon and tofu, pickled veggies from the mountains of Japan, and a chilled shrimp in a cucumber sauce. Not my favorite dish of the night, but it was decent enough.3rd course: sashimi --delicious!4th course: shrimp wrapped in a deep fried piece of bread with some chilli pepper to dip in. went well with the Asahi!5th course: avocado with a chilli paste and pear in a delicious cranberry sauce. Very refreshing.6th course: scallop shrimp, kobe beef and mushroom cooked in a mini hibatchi type gadget served with a vinegar based sauce. amazing--the kobe was perfectly marbled and melted in my mouth. and the sauce was amazing.7th course: mini sushi--it was sushi, but smaller than you get it at most sushi restauarants. wish it were bigger, but the pieces were delicious!8th course: chilean seabass in soy sauce. This was very decadent, but a fairly small portion. It sounds like a lot of food at this point, but since the portions are all small, you don fill up too quickly.9th course: soba noodles w/ choice of topping-I chose yam. took me back to the street stalls in Tokyo!10th course: sorbet -- a bit lackluster, but a nice simple ending.Would definitely return again!, First and foremost, Makota is an experience like none Ive had. A very small and intimate place that requires proper attire but delivers back to you exceptional service and top notch food. Its tied in DC for 1st for food according to Zagat and I can see why. You must take off your shoes, and not use your cell phone. The service is fantastic. Staff are constantly watching over you to fill your glass. Perhaps this is to sell more Sake or other beverages, or thats just part of what you get for $100+ for dinner. Either way, I liked it. I had dishes that Ive never experienced before and one course they brought all the food to be cooked to your table while you were eating previous course, and then they made it at your table. This was the most memorable, as they had scallops, tiger shrimp, Kobe beef, and 2 types of mushrooms, which they proceeded to grill right at the table. All were delicious, and the Kobe beef was extraordinary. Two other favorites: fried seaweed encasing shrimp, and it came with 2 unusual spicy salts and spices.  Main meat dish. Not sure what type of beef, but it was delicious. One of our party got the Kobe beef option and it was exceptional, but the normal beef option was also great. Amazing sauce, interesting presentation...The sake we chose was excellent. Not cheap, but cheapest by the bottle option they had. I would surely go here again as its a culinary and cultural experience you cannot really find elsewhere in DC. Sushi Taro is close, but not the same at all. Its apparently know that your clothes will smell like the food because its small, and as I sit and write, I can smell the flavors of the evening on my clothes., I cant believe all the high raving reviews this place got .... OMG. Are you kidding me?!?!?!?! Ok, I can believe it, but not until I give my fair share review. First of all, this place is tiny...so plan on calling ahead ... they only take reservations only. First thing to note, gentlemen needs to wear a button up or jacket. Sure... I get it. We show up, my friends collar shirt was not considered button up...and she pressed by stating no jeans. Sorry, I didnt recall that was an issue. In all honesty, I just want good food. If you are going to give us hassle about a dress code, we can take our business elsewhere. DC area already has an air of pretentiousness wherever you go.... and I certainly didnt need this bullshit. For the limited space .... I honestly dont really understand why there was a dress code to begin with. Almost everybody ordered the 8-10 course dinner .... which is a combination of small portion of hot & cold entrees. Immediately, when they were grilling the meat, I knew my hair was going to smell like BBQ. So let me get this straight, we are required to dress up, yet knowing there is a chance we were going to leave the restaurant, smelling like BBQ meat?! Where is the (blind) logic in that?! Also, not to mention that it warmed up the place so quickly.Managerial and its staff was always courteous and attentive, but certainly not attentive enough to understand its own customers to figure out what works and what doesnt. We sat by the bar, and to my disappointment, we couldnt even see the chefs making the food. I am pretty sure thats the whole point of sitting by the bar. The bar table was too high and the chefs table was too low...so all you saw were their faces....and not the supposed art they were preparing.We ordered the sake, which I have to say is one of the best sakes I ever had... really smooth. I wanted some hardcore sashimi, so we decided not to order the dinner course, and went straight for a la carte. We wanted to order the eel rolls with avocado.... and she refused to add the avocado. We asked kindly, if shed ask the chef to reconsider. Additionally, she stated that she had this restaurant for 17 years, and this is the way its always been. We never served it then, and we are certainly not going to change the rules now.... and to be most helpful, she recommended that we can order an avocado roll if we wanted, or eel roll by itself. WTF!!!!!!! I am fuming mad at this point...but I dont want to be difficult...so we opted for the eel roll by itself. The food itself is a solid 3.5 - 4 stars... it was good...but certainly not for the price. The overall dining experience took two hours and rated 2 - 2.5 stars. Of course theyd have to be attentive, again, to reiterate my point, its a tiny restaurant. If they werent attentive, theyd be out of business by now. Lets face it. DC just isnt known for sushi...Ive already tried all their supposedly top sushi restaurants in this area. How defeating and utterly frustrating!, Tried almost every sushi place in DC, the local Sushi Boy chain in LA can outdo even the most high priced sushi places in DC. Makoto is a gem among the slew of mediocre costume jewelry in this town. Ambiance is quiet and authentic and the omasake is a bargain!, Another east coast favorite... Ive been to Makoto twice and it is EXPENSIVE... I found out that if you just stick to the tasting menu, you will be financially okay. Just dont become enamored with the toro (BEST ever and Ive had toro in Japan and NYC) and decide to order another couple pieces of nigiri or a few slices of sashimi! Yikes! And just drink beer since they will charge you for the H2O anyway. But regardless, Makoto is the best service Ive had anywhere... the everything-will-floor-you food and impeccable service are worth the price. But even better, its a small, place... barely seats 20 guests. You walk in, greeted by the Japanese (theyre all traditionally Japanese) woman at the door and shown to where to remove your shoes.. then walk into the tatami floored dining area with bamboo seats and tables... aaah, the smell of bamboo... takes me back to Japan into my grandparents home! The women care for you while in their establishment like you are their child... wiping your glass, fixing your napkin... you dont get a chance to notice the condensation from your beer on the table because she swings over to clean it so fast~ bringin you the small plates and portions of mouth watering grilled vegetables or melt in your mouth orange roughy... Its a real experience for many foreigners to Japan. This reminds me of Old Japan... and I miss Old Japan., an experience. nothing like ive ever seen in dc. expensive, but worth it. we got the tasting menu. it was just one awesome dish after another. each dish was delicate, artistically plated, and some were quite challenging. the quality of food was perfect. the fish quality was awesome. we sat at the bar and that was fine. the sushi chef was right in front of us. the restaurant is small, but really ins that cramped. i say if youe going with just 2 people, request the bar. for more than two people, you will want a table. i especially enjoyed going to the bathroom in slippers. that was nice. the wait staff was incredible. their attention to detail was almost obsessive compulsive, and i appreciated that. ive never been to japan, but as far as i know, this is the most authentic japanese experience ive ever had. just trust the restaurant and get the tasting. oh, and dress nicely., Im giving it 3 stars and here is why:I called and made the reservation for 8:15pm on a Friday night for my girlfriend and I. Making the reservation alone was strictly business. I was told I had to wear a sport jacket and that I had to give them a credit card number in order to secure the reservation. Sir, yes, Sir!Judging from the impression of the militarily reservation process I wanted to make sure we got there early especially since I was warned that if we do not show or show too late that I would be charged $70 per person and if I were late, I would lose my reservation. So we arrived at 7:58pm; 17 minutes early. (note: I was reading the time from my cell phone which is connected to satellite so I know it was accurate). After waiting for several minutes a lady came to the tiny box of a waiting area and asks what my name is. I say politely, Last name is LEE. After studying her chicken scratch on a small post-it pad she found 4 other Lees that had reservations that very night. She quickly found my reservation and said, Your reservation is for 8:15pm, it is now 7:54. You wait outside. I what!!?? It was freezing outside. There was no room in the waiting room apparently and we were then kicked out into the cold. And yes, I felt as if I were kicked out. I was angered since I knew I was getting ready to spend some serious money on this meal and if they cannot tell me in a different tone and manner that I am early, sorry there is no space, please wait until your reserved time....I would have been fine. But no, I was told quite sternly to go outside. So, my girlfriend and I took a walk for 15 minutes and returned at 8:15pm on the dot. We were then told that our table was not ready. The sushi Nazi, Queen of the precision and strict rulings of Makoto was now telling me that there was no seat for me at 8:15pm on the dot??? Well, how dare. I never. Just kidding, sort of. I was annoyed again. After being kicked out and having this happen and not being seated until 8:35pm stung a bit. OK, so enough about that. But you get the point...which is, this simple customer service (or lack thereof) ruined the experience from the get-go. Further more, the family that also had a reservation waiting at the same time as us were making their threats etc etc as well.Onto the food: It was some of the best sashimi I have ever had. I upgraded to the Kobe Beef for $25 extra replacing the traditional rib-eye which is included on the basic menu. We drank a cheaper Sake which was actually delicious. The Chef from the 10 course tasting menu of the evening, also prepared one of the simplest yet tastiest Chilean Sea Bass I have ever experienced. In sum, neat experience. It requires you to put on your cultural understanding cap to be able to brush off the difference in service we expect in the US when we spend $250 on a meal for two. At places where we drop that kind of money we are typically treated quite well with the waitstaff ever so conscience that instant gratification and other American customer service expectations are carefully tended to. The food was delectable, the service could have been better in the beginning. And if you are taller than 5 foot 10 inches, be prepared to duck your head, squeeze in your legs, and mind the gap. (2 weeks of Bikram Yoga should suffice as proper preparation for being able to dine for several hours in these conditions). I glad I went but not sure I would aveto go back., Makoto is a tricky place to go to since my spouse and at least one good friend have fish/shellfish allergies. Now, thats not usually a problem at your standard restaurant, where there are many choices and/or the kitchen usually can substitute something to avoid an allergy. Not so with Makoto. Substitutions are not allowed and the primary feature of their menu is the 8-course dinner. I recently went (my second visit) with a friend who doesnt suffer from fish/shellfish allergies, so I was all set...Ive never been to Japan, but from what Ive read and heard about the culture, Makoto is a little slice of Japan in NW DC. The service is curt, but polite, exacting and unbelievably attentive. The cuisine is absolutely first rate. Foods I normally dont care for, such as mussels, I really enjoy at Makoto because I know that whatever appears on the small plate in front of me is absolutely the best quality product available. Every course was delicious and presented in a delicate and appealing way. The fatty tuna melted in my mouth. The Chilean sea bass was like butter on my tongue. The fried shrimp (not tempura) with seaweed was amazing. The small dining room is sparsely decorated in a traditional Japanese style and mostly quiet - a calm oasis of Asian civility. Its not cheap, but afterall, youre paying for the best. Highly recommended., This isnt a place to go if youre a picky eater, but if youre willing to be adventurous I would absolutely recommend trying Makoto at least once. It may be pricy, but is worth the splurge! I got the 8 course meal and there was only one thing in the entire meal that I wasnt a fan of. The first course, a mussle soup, was to die for. And the main course fish was cooked perfectly. Just be sure you dont eat much earlier in the day because youll start to get full half way through the meal., As someone said earlier, do not go IF ANYONE HAS A FOOD ALLERGY. I have a shellfish allergy and was sorely disappointed. However what I did taste was stunning, and absolutely delicious. The service is great and attentive, and will make sure everything is perfect. The sushi is absolutely amazing. I loved this place but I can only give it 4 stars for refusing to swap something, which is understandable but aggravating,, Wifey and I did the 10 course. Cant really add more than whats already been written, but I will reiterate that the Yellowtail Sushi and Fatty Tuna Sashimi was FRACKIN phenomenal., Went here for our 3 year anniversary/Valentines Day extravaganza and be forewarned; this place is not cheap. We had the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu ($45 for a half-bottle), both got the 10 course meal and made it out of here for a little over $200, which seems a *tad* on the steep side, but maybe I just dont get the 10 course meal enough to know. That being said, every course was amazing. Some of the highlights: the green-tea infused/chili pepper combo that came with the deep-fried shrimp on a stick things... the sashimi was ALL melt-in-your-mouth, the cranberry/Grand Mariner sorbet was so tasty without being too sweet. The atmosphere is great; I love how everyone yells a greeting whenever a new party enters the restaurant. This is not a place for crowds; there are TWO tables that could seat 4 people; besides that, plan on coming as a party of two.I would definitely recommend for a special occasion., Makoto is unaffectionately known as the Nazi Sushi Restaurant by my friends. Yes, the sushi is great, but it is very expensive with small portions. Youl leave still hungry after spending $100. What I dislike the most is the snooty and unyeilding attitude. The first time we went, we were admonished for not taking off our shoes immediately. Next, when I ordered green tea, I asked for sugar and was told they didn have any. Hell, what kitchen doesn have sugar? Yes, I know, traditional Japanese don put sugar in their tea, but I am American and I AM THE CUSTOMER and paying lots of money so bring me the darn sugar if I ask for it.Save your money and go upstairs for sushi. Same kitchen, lower prices, less attitude. Or even better, go to Bambu up the street instead., wow! one of the best restaurants in dc! no bento boxes here...after 8 courses, i stopped counting....so fresh and flavorful with exceptionally attentive service. the only downisde is that yeah, youre kind of sitting in the kitchen, so your clothes will smell like the kitchen for a few days., After much thought, I still dont get the removing the shoe part. In Asian households that I grew up in, you remove shoes cause the house is CLEAN, and/or you are about to enter tatami area. Makoto is neither. Asking for credit card for reservation is very mom-and-pop style. The tightness of the space and the rigidity of the servers makes the whole experience unforgettable. Perhaps that is why people like it so much, its a very different experience. It doesnt work for me. The food was decent, not the best. Raw fish is standard, no bluefin tuna. The portions are tiny. 10 dishes down and I am still hungry. The kitchen could be a lot cleaner (as well as chefs outerwear). To sum up, the rigidity of the servers gets an A for constantly poring stuff into my glass/cup. The whole scene about crowdedness, removing shoes, strict rules...etc is probably marketing ploy to make people feel its authentic. The food is okay. The value is okay. Now that Sushi Taro becomes a competitor, I believe Kaiseki menu at Sushi Taro has comparable if not better quality, greater quantity and the setting is much more comfortable. The only thing Makoto has over Sushi Taro are the servers that constantly keep your glass full. But I can do that., This is by far the best Japanese restaurant in DC. Simply awesome, and please try the 10 course dinner menu. My fiance and I had a very sore butt sitting on a hard wooden chair for the 2 hour meal, but it was well worth it. Dont go if you cant afford at least $100/person., Neat experience. So intimate and frisky. 10 courses. I was full. Wife was full. We were full. Menu is a surprise and different every time. We drank 8 bottles of Saki and I saw that fish again later at home.One negative: I hate the smell of feet so I was constantly weary of when I was going to smell someone else feet while I was eating. You must remove your shoes before going inside the hut., Outrageous but true statements:- This is the best meal Ie had in DC, ever.**(**Be advised that I have not yet eaten at Komi or minibar.)- This was a better dining experience than I had at The Inn at Little Washington. Yes, you read that correctly. The service at Makoto was more efficient, and the food presentation was more thoughtful.- The black cod here rivals (but does not surpass) that at Rasika.I don see the need to run down the entire list of what I ate, but I would certainly opt for the tasting menu. It so nice to have the chef do the thinking for you, especially when you can trust that everything you are about to eat is going to taste like heaven.A few notables, however: The mussel and mushroom soup served in a conch shell = best soup presentation I have ever encountered. As I was eating and slurping my soup, I kept thinking to myself Why isn all soup served in a seashell?. Fried softshell crab with rice cracker coating accompanied by green tea salt and chili pepper powder for more flavor. The salt and hot were perfect together. One part of a three-plated course was a cold, sweet, fruit-like squash in a citrus syrup. This was the best part of the meal. I not sure Ie tasted something better in my life. Soba noodles with mushrooms. This was served with a self-serve spice box, which added to the fun. To be clear, all of the food was outstanding; some of the above are just still making my mouth water.In addition to the food I also had warm sake (I usually like it cold, but it was a dreary and wet evening, so having it warm made more sense); Asahi; and the best plum wine Ie ever had. This review seems overburdened by superlatives, but when I say the best Ie had, I mean it. There are multiple items at Makoto to which that statement applies.As noted earlier, the near-perfect service is very Japanese. The sense of propriety and restraint expected in Japanese establishments makes the delights exiting from the kitchen even more surprising and charming. There are no missteps.My only complaints are that the spartan wooden box chairs are very uncomfortable after a couple of hours and that the restaurant was very cold. That said, I must have looked cold during my meal because one of the servers brought me a sweater. I am not sure to whom it belonged, but it sure was nice to stop shivering.Often when I hear of a must-try restaurant with a prix fixe menu I try it once just to see what all the fuss is about. Makoto is different in that I will be back again and again; I can wait to see what they serve up next time., this place has a cult-like following and rightfully so.i mean, their food is just so off the chart, its beyond phenomenal. it really really is.the best seat in the house in this tiny intimate restaurant is at the bar, where you can see the chefs cook up your meal in real time.you must make reservations here. also you must wear a suit jacket and slacks (for male). and yes, you must have your shoes off as well. and also provide credit card upon reservation. and yes,,, its all worth it.and those people terrified of feet smell... you do have access to slippers, so they help some what (although whether they clean those slippers with antibacterial antifungal spray i do not know).go and order the tasting menu. its worth it.imo, this is one of those must try places in dc. have deep pockets and enjoy., 1) I like all the dress code rules here. The pomp and decorum fits well with the embassy/diplo crowd Get the omakase. Its worth it to eat the random traditional Japanese dishes Fish is as fresh as it gets Ive been going here since I was 17 with parents, prom date, friends etc and Im always blown away I miss living in DC because of this place, The only thing I have to add to previous reviews is that the $60/person wasnt unreasonable considering how darn tasty everything was and the service., OMG YUM OMG. Had been dying to eat here for ages and finally did last Saturday night. My sis and I opted for the 8 courses, for $60 and didnt do any of the upgrades. They asked us if we liked raw fish and if we chose mushroom or veggie broth and to choose a fish (CHOOSE THE ROCKFISH!) for a few of the various courses. I (obviously) love food but have only eaten in a handful of the top restaurants - according to Washingtonians top 100 anyway (e.g., some faves being Minibar, Kinkeads, Zaytinya) My sister, however, spends a lot of money on really good food in the citys top restaurants and she said that this meal was the best shed had in a looooong time.I think I think Im missing a course cuz, sadly, I cant recall what it could be :( My sister remembers something with red bean paste, but I think shes crazy cuz I have no recollection of that. Here goes! (The order might be slightly off)Course 1: Mushroom and conch soup, served in a beautiful conch shell atop a bed of sea salt with a little flame on the plate. Deelicious. Beautiful presentation.Course 2: Three types of sashimi (skip jack seared just a bit, tuna, and the most freaking delicious spanish mackerel ever), served with a shiso leaf, fresh wasabi, ginger. Beautiful presentation and all of the fish was incredibly fresh and the best sashimi Ive ever tasted.Course 3: Three part square dish - left side was a green very crunchy, mountain vegetable, middle was a shrimp and scallop on top of some orangey-pink citrus segment/sauce, on the right was something tastey and rice-vinegary (Im sorry my memory sucks!) This was very good but not my fave course.Course 4: Tempura fried softshell crab, actually coated with crushed Japanese rice crackers and then tempura fried. It was served alone and the softshell crab tasted nice, but it was kinda dry. Prob our least favorite course, though it was super-creative!Course 5: Three pieces of sushi (I think they were tuna, yellowtail, and horse mackerel). Totally awesome, but I prefered the spanish mackerel (to the almost as delicious) horse mackerel.Course 6: A delicious little piece of salmon (cooked) in tasty broth (my sis had mushroom broth and I had veggie broth, both with seaweed). This was great. Course 7: My sister had the wood-grilled rockfish filet (specified at the start of our meal when the waitress asked us) served with some kind of radish. The rockfish was the most delicious part of the meal (next to the sashimi). It was soooooo soooooo, sooooo good. Best piece of (cooked) fish both of us had ever tasted. I wish Id chosen it, since this course followed the salmon in broth course, but my salmon was pretty awesome too.Course 8: A watermelon-berry like ice shavings...nice clean ending. I think this was actually course 9 (and Im forgetting course 8). Grrrr! I suck! Will update if I recall the missing course. The real standouts were the: grilled rockfish (insanely simple and delicious), sashimi (OMG that spanish mackerel), sushi (wonderfully fresh), and conch soup (flavor but especially presentation). I cant wait to come back., First, I have to say, the 10-course meal here was absolutely DELICIOUS!! The flavors of the stock in the conch soup and soba noodles reminded me of my dear oba-chan (grandma) authentic cooking. Also, the sushi and sashimi were so good and fresh...really cut perfectly too (that important!) And at $60 per 10 -course meal per person (without upgrades or drinks), it was a bargain!The reason I only gave Makoto FOUR stars instead of FIVE were twofold:One: We had to wait 40 minutes for our first course to arrive - that is not a good scene when you have already begun with sake! But once the first course arrived, the rest of the meal was timely! (and yummy)Two: Now, this is a long story but the incident is worth repeating to all you Yelpers out there!! The head chef of Makoto actually THREW OUT A CUSTOMER AND HIS DATE mid-meal who were sitting right next to me at the counter!!!! OMG!! Wha.....?This is the scenario: Husband and I are enjoying sake and waiting for our first course (aforementioned 40 minute lag time). Next to us are a Japanese man and his date, enjoying their first few courses when I overhear the man ask the head chef (in Japanese) for the fresh wasabi root so that he could show it to his date. The head chef states that the fresh wasabi is only given to the customer to use with the sashimi course - which was one course ago. Man states in Japanese, I know but am willing to pay extra for it. Head chef relents grudgingly but I hear him guffaw under his breath. Then, man tries to impress date with lecture on fresh wasabi root and then the date proceeds to grate the wasabi root over and over until it is just a little nub. Next course comes for the couple: the arare-covered soft shell crab. Waitress comes to take wasabi root nub and gratings away but the man states he wants to keep it. Again, head chef explains it is not for the crab dish- just the sashimi dish!! Then, when the man still insists to keep the wasabi root nub, all hell breaks loose. Pans are jumbled about, head chef is yelling, arms are being waved around and then, a very UNCOMFORTABLE scene envelops the counter and the counter patrons who notice this is NOT normal. Including me....I DON want to be a part of this! But the foolish man is sitting right next to me!Next, can you guess what happened? The head chef yells at the man and says SAYONARA!! You are not welcome in my restaurant, you cannot eat here. Man and date are in disbelief, as am I and husband and the rest of the counter patrons. Man and date sit there silently, not knowing what to do. Finally, after an eon, head waitress comes and informs the couple: sorry but your meal is over, please leave And they do!! Dishes, chopsticks and cups are hastily taken away as if the incident never happened.WHAT?? I have never seen a diner get kicked out mid-meal, and on what seemed like a first date too. Suddenly, the couple was gone and I had to pick my chin off the counter and be on my best behavior.After that, we had to buck up, enjoy our food, make sure we had our cell phones OFF and be good! Luckily for us, after the meal was over, the head chef actually smiled at us and thanked us....ah, Japanese culture is so interesting!, This place has great service and the food is very good. There is nothing that makes you want to live next door to eat there every day. However, as a special occasion kind of place to have a dining experience unique to the dc metro area, Makoto is a great choice.Sushi is fresh, presentation is excellent and service is top notch., As much as I appreciate reinvented sushi rolls or pan Asian trendy places with pizzaz, there something to be said for straight up old school tradition. Makoto boasts an amazingly authentic atmosphere and fish with can-be-beat freshness. If youe more of a I only do rolls named after states and cities person, prepare yourself for the Real McCoy. These are not fancified designer rolls, this is the real thing - fresh and raw ingredients. I am a fan of both kinds of cuisine, but must say Makoto takes the cake for an authentic experience. Both my parents (who tend to be tougher critics) were head over heels for this impressively legit Japanese gem., As the food courses have already been covered here, this will be quick.Excellent food. Extremely fresh. Extremely! I took my boyfriend who lived in Japan for 4 years and he was extremely pleased. Makoto is the place of extreme deliciousness. I threw in that extreme because I thought it would be more fun to have it in every sentence.Uncomfortable seats. Yes, thats right. Not comfortable. Very minimalist. Especially if youre a person with long legs. Minus one star for the seating!Also, this place is in the bum middle of nowhere. Not a problem for you lucky (except at 5pm on weekdays) souls who drive. But we were wondering where the heck our taxi driver was taking us.This is a place for those who love Japanese food, for foodies, and those eating their way through the District., My boyfriend loves sushi and Japanese food so we made reservations at Makoto basd on Yelps ratings. Im a vegetarian so I cant say I got a true taste of Makoto but I thought the food I had was very good. The pickled plum sushi roll was unlike any vegetarian sushi I had ever had before. Everything my boyfriend had he really enjoyed and said its probably the 2nd best sushi place hes ever been to (and hes been to a good amt).The service is great and very much part of the experience. The native Japanese ladies will barely let you touch your glass without refilling it for you and are very kind and helpful., I have written over 150 reviews with about 80% of them being food related. After dining here last night, I want to down grade all of my other reviews of restaurants as Makoto was one of the best dining experiences of my entire life. First off, Makoto is much more than just a sushi place. In fact, only about 1/4 of our food involved raw fish. The other dishes had cooked salmon, mussels, and there were even soups that you drank right out of the shell! There is saliva on my key board as I write about how AMAZING the food was. I really dont want to go dish by dish as I ordered the 10 courses with all the upgrades, but I promise you with all of my yelp heart that Makotos food is absolutely divine and perfect for either an opulent night of dining or just keep it low key. Its versatile in style but 100% perfect in taste!! As for decor, its not much. You sit on these small wooden boxes (which I will admit after 10 courses my back of killing me) and the size of the entire restaurant rivals that of my current condo (i.e. small). I will also add that the waitstaff is excellent with their service always ensuring you have tea (which by the way is AMAZING. I mean, who knew tea could be so great?!) and sake were always filled. On a side note, they dont speak English very well so its difficult to understand them at times so just roll with it. Who cares what it is... its just tasty! Arigato, Makoto!!, This restaurant offers an exceptional experience and the food is wonderful and creatively prepared. You will not be disappointed. If you go, definitely get the 9 course chefs tasting menu. It costs about $60 a person and definitely worth it, specially compared to tasting menus at other DC restaurants. This is a truly authentic Japanese dining experience. If you are looking for casual sushi, go somewhere else., Makoto is more than a restaurant; its an experience. Those with open minds, and appetites for novelty will appreciate it.Our courses went something like this:1. conch soup. shitake, white mushroom, conch, clam. in a conch shell on sea salt (decoration), next to a blue gel flame on a lemon wedge (decoration)2. avocado with miso paste. mussels in oil, vinegar, onions3. sashimi: flounder, seared spanish mackerel with a dab of ginger, tuna. wasabi, soy sauce.4. three squares: crab salad, shrimp & scallop in citrus, and crunchy vegetable in fruit sauce5. tempura soft crab with crushed rice cracker batter. green tea salt. chili powder.6. nigiri sushi: tuna, yellowtail? scallop?7. salmon with skin cooked in broth8. main course (salmon with charred skin, bones. crushed radish)9. buckweat noodle soup with seaweed10. ice shavings with raspberry flavor. hot green tea.I would probably go back, and order something more exotic as the main course. Salmon is already on the menu (maybe even raw and cooked), and the main course salmon was difficult to eat with bones & charred skin, and smelled unpleasant. I might not order hot tea, since it was included with the final course. My partner had two ichiban beers, so must have enjoyed them.Our reservation was for 6 PM, and we had to call to delay it to 6:15. We were the first guests (declining popularity? late diners?). The seats were uncomfortable, as were the waitresses standing by preparing to swoop in if we emptied our glasses. By the end of dinner, however, I had assumed good posture, and was completely comfortable with hovering wait staff :)Dress code is dress shirt & slacks. No t-shirt, jeans. The dining area is tiny, and by the end it was completely full. The waitresses actually impressed upon us a sense of urgency as our reservation was only for two hours!I was happy to pay $180 for two, but I dont know that it would be worth it again., After reading rave reviews, a friend and I got dressed in our Sunday finest and headed over to Makoto for a mostly positive experience (This was a Thursday night in June by the way). The decor as others have noted is very minimal, the restaurant is small, and the service is very attentive. But how was the food?For the most part stellar, our favorite being the soft shell crab which was eyes-rolled-back-in-the-head amazing. The conch soup and sushi were also top notch. Out of 10 courses, there were only 3 misses...but they were bad misses. One course was so salty that it was not edible. The grilled fish was over cooked and rubbery. Finally, the most disappointing was the Kobe beef (I had ordered the $20 upgrade). I was expecting a tender succulent cut of the that marbled massaged and beer feed flesh but what I got was tough with a lot of ligaments. I kid you not, after 5 minutes of chewing my friend could not break down the meat enough to swallow and so she discretely spit it out in a napkin. Luckily we had a good laugh about it. I hope that it was an off night for Makoto, but future diners beware.All in all, I paid $207 with tip (including 2 glasses of plum wine, and one kobe beef upgrade).
38|marcels-by-robert-wiedmaier-washington|I dont remember the food nor the service being spectacular, even though its supposed to be one of the top restaurants in the city. The entrance is pretty grand, but the inside decor isnt very spectacular. Very old school and not as stately as most other restaurants of the same caliber. Id say theyre due for a revamp.They seated us at an intimate table off to the side of the main dining room, which I guess was kinda cute but the placement of the table just seemed like an afterthought.The best part of the whole place though was the complimentary limo service to the Kennedy Center for a show we were going to see. And since it didnt seem like anyone else was on their way there, we had the limo to ourselves, back and forth. Pretty sweet., My first connection to Marcels was on OpenTable.com where I made my reservation for a romantic dinner while my girlfriend was in town. I must say that I have never had a restaurant acknowledge a note you add to the online reservation....Marcels was a first. Not only did they seat us in a special area for our dining pleasure, the waiter took particular interest to immediately ask my girlfriend if her trip to DC is going well right when we arrived. The service continued on a great note, as the polite gentlemen in formal suits spent the night caring for our needs. The wine selection was excellent and forty dollars later, we had a wonderful white wine to compliment our order, a Alaskan Halibut special and Salmon for the GF. The fish was fresh tasting, free of a frozen, washed, or fishy taste. The portions were French in size but also French is flavor. Rich in butter, garlic, and a perfect combination of spices, my Halibut was wonderful. After dinner wine complimented our chocolaty cake, which filled me up to the rim. The check helped relieve some of my wallet weight , being about a days worth of work to pay for the meal. However, we are in DC: I am willing to pay for a fine French menu and service. I would highly recommend Marcels for its fine attention to formal dining in every aspect of the food, service, and atmosphere., Marcel, Chef/Owner Robert Weidmaiers son and the namesake of his restaurant, is one lucky kid. While my dad is an excellent cook (props to dad), I certainly didnt grow up on food like this! The seasonal Belgian/French menu never disappoints. The Mussel Gratin was amazing, as was the Lobster Bisque with Lobster Salad and the Arugula Salad. I made my whole dinner out of appetizers. My companion had the Beef Fillet...and flipped over it. The portions are smaller (tres French), but I prefer it that way. I read somewhere that we really lose taste for an item after the third bite, so its better to feast on a few things instead. The dining room (having undergone a somewhat recent face lift) is very comfortable and inviting. The bar area is also a great place to park yourself for a spell. And since the place is generally very busy, the bar might be exactly where you wind up if you werent clever enough to make a reservation. Youll definitely PAY for your dinner, but you will also really enjoy it., OK so tried this nr 5 rank in DC. Expectations were high obviously! What can I say, service was attentive, ambience OK in an old Belgian style. Had mussels to start with, halibut for main and chocolate mousse for desert. A nice Alsace to go with the fish. Was it good? Yes! Was it very special? No! Was it expensive? Yes! Will I go there again? Probably not because of the $-quality ratio. But if they cut the price by 50% I may reconsider., I had heard alot about Marcels. Dinner reservation on a Saturday @ 7:45. I hated to have to pay $8.00 to valet. Entrance is OK nothing special...almost past right by in my car. Had a drink at the bar and was charged by the glass. I was overcharged $14 per glass of cheap french wine! Sat down for dinner and the menu was very exciting, ordered the steak and my wife ordered the veal shank. The steak was very good , but the portion was TINY TINY especially for $40. my wifes veal shank was small as well. Ordered the Fig desert for $14, and on a small plate was 4 tiny figs the size of quarter! The place is WAY to overpriced and no entertainment..nothing not even any background music..and very noisy too. Not worth the money!, This place really should have a higher Yelp rating. Im not sure why people are saying this place is so expensive...compared to other fine dining restaurants in the area, the prices are the same -- and its certainly not as expensive as say, Komi.My fiancee chose to take me to Marcels for my 27th birthday the other night. I was a bit hesitant because it isnt one of the top Yelp fine dining restaurants, but it should be!Everything was wonderful from the start. He had told the wait staff it was my birthday so right off the bat they gave us complimentary champagne.Our waiter was awesome. Really friendly but not over the top and attentive but not smothering. I really have a thing about great service and this guy was IT.We decided to order three courses each, although the menu was only broken down into two things, appetitizers and entrees. They also have a chefs tasting menu that you can order either a few courses or just al a carte items from, a nice touch.I had an arugula salad with great tangy parmesan cheese, a bowl of rustic, cream soup and a seafood stew. Everything was WONDERFUL, but let me tell you about this soup. It was a fall-themed soup (wasnt pumpkin, but it was something like that) and it was the best soup Ive ever had, hands down. Creamy, spicy, everything you want. The seafood stew was also really tasty, but that point I was stuffed and had to save room for dessert (it was my birthday, after all!) Since I wanted something light, I ordered the roasted banana ice cream. It was awesome. They brought it out with a candle in it, too, which was a nice touch. The ice cream was served in three little scoops, each one spread across a long plate. A great presentation for a really flavorful treat -- you know how some ice creams arent really flavored very strong with the theme ingredient? Well, this was.Overall, Id tell anyone I know to try Marcels. And yelpers should really reconsider this place and give it at least four stars!, I am LE SIGH that this place isnt lauded more vocally on this site. This is one of my fave places to eat in DC (and having lived in the area for more than 20 years, I am not just speaking out of my heiny). Im not entirely sure how you can beat a pre-theater prix fixe dinner thats actually tasty, with car service to and from the kennedy center... setting -- having dined at too many places where I have to scream at my dinner partner, I wholly appreciate being able to hear my companions AND enjoy my food. the place is divided into smaller intimate spaces with lots of fabric and carpet intervening. romantic vibe. piano guy in the bar heard throughout the restaurant was fun.service -- therere reading glasses on the foyer table, in case you forgot yours. we were asked about, oh, 10 times, if and when we were due for the Kennedy center, and we were On Time. butterfly service? do they seriously do that anymore? yes they do! and its precious!food -- delectable. pricey, yes. esp for DC, which I consider a wasteland of good food and at exorbitant prices. husbands butternut squash soup rivalled the best soup ever. the signature boudin blanc was creamy and airy (altho why oh why pair with overwhelming celery root puree and wine reduction? just gimme the sausage). rabbit loin moist and luscious. creme brulee disappeared in an instant. note re: the wine list -- veer away from the heavy hitters (ie napa cabs and A list bordeaux) and there are gems! this place is a diamond in a neighborhood where usually there arent very many good options. as a matter of fact, worth going to even if youre not going to a show., Took my fiance here during our let get engaged trip in December. As others have commented, the prix fixe pre-theater dinner with service to the Kennedy Center can be beat for this level of food. It has a quiet, romantic atmosphere...and the servers are very attentive yet we never felt rushed. Food portions were quite good compared to what you might find at other fine dining locales. She had Ahi Tuna and I had pork. Both were well cooked and very flavorful. The maitre dwas aware that it was our engagement trip and sent over a complimentary bottle of champagne and dessert. As an added bonus...we had our driver drop us off at the National Christmas Tree after the show at the Kennedy Center. He was delighted to do so and drove us as close to the tree as possible.All in all, a very enjoyable dinner and we look forward to dining at Marcel on our next trip to DC., Traveling by myself, but not wanting to waste a free night in DC, I chose to dine at Marcels; and am I glad I did! From the moment I arrived, I knew it would be an event. I was thoughtfully seated with a full view of both the dining room and the kitchen. The service was friendly and helpful. Not the least bit snobby. I enjoyed 6 courses which were timed perfectly. The sommelier expertly selected wines by the glass for each. My request for a copy of the menu was cheerfully fulfilled along with a special booklet of DC Chefs, featuring Marcels own Robert Wiedmaier. Next time I am DC, I will not go to Marcels alone.... Ill foot the bill for the additional plane fare and bring my wife to share the royal experience!, I love French-Belgian food. And like many of you, I love researching restaurants and seeing what others think about it. Which is how I arrived at Marcels the first time after reading much about Robert Wiedmaiers home of great cooking. I liked it. A lot. The food is good, the service is great, and the decor is tasteful. Make sure you try some of the nice and rich soups., part of the reason to go to all these medical conferences is to go to some fabulous new city and try some fabulous restaurant, and marcels did not disappoint--it wasnt my first choice, but its also gotten great reviews, so why not?the place didnt look terribly fancy from the inside, but i liked the fact that all the tables were spread out--so youre not listening to the conversations around you. the service staff was very very attentive.you can choose single plates, 3-, 5-, or 7- course tasting menu, with about 4 choices for each course...or you could choose multiple items from a single course and none from others. a very flexible menu with lots of variety.i had to bow out of the 7 course tasting menu, opting only for the 5....and while nothing on the menu sounded amazing, everything *was* amazing. i mean, seriously. from the super-fresh super-light hamachi to the filet that i could almost cut with a fork, my meal was totally rocking. add to that some halibut and foie gras in the middle...mmmm...so we then decided to split dessert. apparently if you order just one item off the menu, it comes at a ridiculous cost. the pineapple upside down cake with the pineapple ravioli was a disappointment...and it also cost $20. ugh!good place...but next time ill try another dc hotspot., The service was excellent. The space is cozy so it was a bit difficult to hear my dinner companion over neighboring conversations. I started with a goat cheese and beet entr39e, and then had an Alaskan halibut. My third course was a berry dessert. The construction of the dessert made it difficult to fork but overall it was tasty., One of the best meals of my life. I was lucky enough to have my wife treat me here on my birthday and it went above all expectations I had.The food was just amazing, in taste and presentation. We were both pleased with every dish they brought out, and of course tried some of each others food and were equally impressed with what the other had ordered. The wait staff was great in this department, answering every question we had about the menu items.Speaking of the wait staff, they were of the best caliber in DC: attentive to every thing going on at our table, and service that is refined without being arrogant or abrasive. We also brought two special bottles of wine since it was my birthday, and they were happy to decant each of them for me (tip: always share wine you bring with your waiter). The manager came by twice to see how our meal was and if there were any questions or comments we had. They do a great job of making you feel like you are the most important guest in the restaurant, even if youre seated next to Senators or celebrities.I have dined at some of the nicest places in the country (and many outside of it) and I cannot recommend this place enough, it is right near the top of my list. If you want an absolutely fantastic meal in DC and youre not afraid to spend some money you MUST put Marcels on your list., We went to Marcels on 8/26/08 for our wedding anniversary and had a wonderful time!We drove up and didnt see the valet, so we drove around to the back side and parked ourselves in the garage. When we came up, however, the valet was back out front. Oh well. No biggie. (They did retrieve our car for us still, when we were done.) We were very warmly greeted as we came in and sat down. The service throughout the night was top notch. Very friendly, helpful, and attentive.The waiter explained the menu - which has 7 courses listed. You can choose 3, 4, 5, or 7 courses. We both went with 4 courses (for $75). The waiter explained that each portion size was fairly small - though the portions for course 3 and 5 were larger than the others. I had the baby arugula salad, tuna tartar, new york strip, and the chocolate dessert. My husband had the corn and shrimp soup, beef tartar, phyllo wrapped lamb, and chocolate dessert. For us - the small portion size for each course was PERFECT. We left totally stuffed. We didnt even eat much of the wonderful bread they brought us.Each course we had was excellent. Everything was perfectly cooked and the flavor combinations were delectable! They have a pretty extensive wine list. The prices were OK. Not a great value - but some good choices. They had a large group in the back room. We didnt hear them, but we saw the staff walk by several times with some delicious looking hor douerves. I only mention this in case someone reading is thinking of having a group function there. Overall a great experience! I would definitely recommend Marcels for a nice evening out. However, if you are a big eater, the 4 course menu may not do it for you. I found the prices reasonable for this caliber of restaurant. It is pricey - but that was expected. It was a worthwhile splurge IMO. :-) Since giving it 4.5 stars isnt an option, Ill go with 4 stars. Top notch - but not the best of my life to date., Best meal Ive had in DC. Service was first class and perfectly choreographed. The food was special. Though we only ordered 4 courses, I counted 6 dishes placed in front of me. Each was a masterpiece, and I had serious plate-envy for the people next to me eating what I didnt order., this place is hard to rate. i was swinging back and forth between four and five stars. how can you compare this place to all the other places in DC? i think in the end Marcels is like Obelisc in a league of its own and within this league they might not deserve five stars, but if you are looking for the best restaurants in DC, Marcels should be on the top of the list. the place is old school in a way, and so are most of the people. the service is impeccable. there is not just one waiter responsible for you table, there is a whole swarm of them but just like in the great restaurants of the world you dont feel them around you, only when they put a new course on your table or take away an empty plate. while the food is exceptionally good, dont expect to leave the place with at least $100 less in your wallet per person (and that does not include tip, and will probably include one or two glasses of wine). but dont worry, the money is well spend. you will have no regrets. i had the five course tasting menu with the scallops (well make that one), the rabbit, the tartar, and for desert the apple fig tart. and each course was amazing ... words fail me to describe them. the tartar was out of this world ... i know it is not everyones thing, but if it is give it a try, you will not be disappointed, to the contrary you will saviour every bite of it. what is amazing about the dishes is that they are not over architected, but each bite is full of taste. so if you want to take your significant other out for a special date ... go to Marcels., I was very underwhelmed with the dining experience at Marcels. The food was just OK and the portions were small given the price. The service was also uninspired and the area we dined in smelled like an airport terminal. Overall, it was not a memorable meal. In fact, one year later I can barely remember the name of the restaurant. It is my opinion that there are much better restaurants at this price point in DC. I agree with other reviewers that the restaurant was noisy as well. To be fair, some have suggested that my bad experience was perhaps a result of the chefs attention being more focused on his other restaurant, Brasserie Beck, which he was launching around the same time I dined at Marcels., Tres tres magnifique - from the service to the sommelier to the meal!There is not enough to be said for their keen attention to detail and the old fashioned fine dining experience. I have been going to Marcels for the past 3 years and have yet to be disappointed. Whether I stop in for a glass of champagne and lobster risotto (which is to-die-for) or a large client diner, the staff is impeccably attentive. The duck confit ravioli and the boudin blanc are major highlights to the menu. It is not a cheap night by any means, but your money is well spent. Reservations are a must, but the bar is just as charming. I dont think their quaint bar (with live piano playing) gets the attention that it deserves, but I also enjoy that Marcels remains a sparkling and somewhat hidden gem from the boisterous dinning crowd., If youre ready to drop two or three hundred bucks for your lady, this is a good place to do it. We had a 5 course dinner with wine pairings. Few of the dishes were anything less than superb. The wine was quite well chosen. And the atmosphere had just enough touches of french-ness to make you feel like the place was worth $300, but enough intimacy and flourishes to feel like it was not a cliche.Im really giving it 4.5 stars as the service, which everyone else raves about, was kind of off (took 10 minutes for our waiter to visit our table the first time, they brought out the wrong dish for me). But even the mistakes were gracefully handled and we quickly forgave them., We wanted to celebrate Christmas early since we will be traveling to China on Christmas eve. Marcel only has price fix meals ranges between 3-7 courses. We got the 5 course meal. Our first course was the crab and the seared tuna. The lumped crab cake was delicious, it was not cake per se because there was no breading. the lumped crab was stuck together with the crab brain (male crabs) and seved on this chestnut cream tasted like thinly mashed potato. The tuna has a weird sauce, and could have been more rear. The second courses we had were Turbotin and Red Snapper. Turbotin was shipped from France and the Red Snapper was from some other country. Both were all caught in the wild instead of farm raised. Turbotin was thin with the texture of a sea bass, it came with asparagus and this olive oily soy sauce, very good! The red snapper came with a rich sauce, creamy and very tasty. The third courses we had were rabbit loin and boudin blanc. They definitely had the best and the wackiest tasting (in a really good way). the rabbit loin was like a sausage with rabbit meat, and the Boudin Blanc was a mixture of creamy meat but were delicious! (see pictures) The last course we had before dessert were duck and venison, the venison had a richer sauce than the duck, I was okay with the duck, nothing too special. The dessert was small but extremely rich flavored and plated beautifully. Overall the food was great, we spend about $300 with 3 drinks and 2 cappuccino. We also received 5 star service, the waiter was great with the wine selection, and provided detailed description to the food choices. We really enjoyed our meal :) and we did not even know till we walk out that Brasserie beck was like a sister restaurant to Marcel., I went here tonight with my sister and husband. The food is classic French. The ambiance is just so so for me. It looks like its a fancy fine dining place ( professional table settings, very well dressed waiters...), but its not intimate at all. We sat in the back room. The tables are really close together; you can hear everybody elses in that room and in the front room. Its very noisy.Its so much better at Inn Little Washington. Food wise, I wasnt wowed, but its very good overall. We ordered the 4 course; I got to try my husband and sisters dishes also. These are the best dishes I had tonite: the crab leg, boudin blanc, duck breast, and lamb ternderloin in phyllo. Ive been to Per Se, French Laundry, Jean Georges..; so I can not help comparing the food and service of Marcels to those places. Thats why I only give it 4 star., We had a pre-dinner tasting menu at Marcels. Were at DC to see the Boshoi Ballet performance at the Kennedy Center. From the moment we walked in, we were treated like royalty. After being seated by the friendly hostess, my girlfriend and I were immediately attended to by our charming waiter, David. He was very knowledgeable regarding the tasting menu and even gave us great recommendation. The food had the right portion and was absolutely amazing. David even served complimentary sweets to conclude our stupendous dinner. It was also convenient that they provided limo service to the Kennedy Center. Our driver, Syem is from Egypt and was very courteous.Overall, it was a fantastic experience. I highly recommend Marcels., MAGNIFIQUE!Cest lieu me rappel des amours pour la cuisine et un homme!Seriously, this restaurant is probably the most exquisite place to bring harmony, happiness, and joy with your beloved ones. You can never go wrong with the tasting menu. Its definitely worth trying the chefs different creations. The fish soup is amazing! The venison, fois gras.. everything!You might even get to see Clarence Thomas hanging out around :), Started with delicate duck ravioli and a crusted salmon in a sauce. Both were exceptional. Main courses were lamb in phyllo dough (3 lamb nuggets encased in a triangle of dough) and duck with duck confit. To finish, we had a pumpkin panna cotta with candied sunflower seeds and pumpkin ice cream and an assortment of 4 cheeses. Service is very smooth. My only qualm is the limited number of entree course selections - lamb, duck, venison, and bison (We like red meat so this wasnt a problem, but I expect to see some fish alternatives). The appetizer selection is vast because you choose from among four different courses. Service was exceptionally smooth. Well return. MAybe for an evening at the Kennedy Center if we go for an early meal., We celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary at Marcels with a 7 course chefs tasting menu (paired with wine). The food and wine portions were quite generous and each course was perfect! The staff is very attentive and friendly. I must have received 7-8 new napkins because I kept dropping them. I wasnt even aware that my napkins were under the table but the staff certainly was paying attention because every 30 minutes, they would come with a new napkin for me.We loved how the dining room was broken into sections with little steps leading to each room. The environment was upscale and very cozy. Next time we go, well try the 5 course menu instead. 7 courses with wine is a bit too much to eat and drink even over 3 hours :-), We went here for a special occasion and I gotta say. this is probably the best food Ive had in DC. but the price is double what I would have paid at a restaurant of similar quality in another city.Anyway, each course was meticulously prepared and plated in the most appetizing and artistic of ways. a veritable carnival for the senses, i must say. Will I go here again? hmmm... thats a hard one. probably not... since I can go to fleur de lys and get a prixe fix for 80s bucks a person when im back in SF or LV.but if you want awesome french food (okay okay belgian... but lets be honest... its really the same thing as far as this place is concerned) in DC, this is your place., Hands down still my favorite restaurant in DC. Robert Wiedmaier owner/chef since 1999. His previous stints include a 2 Michelin star restaurant in Holland, the Four Seasons, Aquarelle, and Morrison House.They are only open for dinner but 2 years ago I had my 25 yr. anniversary with my firm there with 20 friends for lunch. The food and service were amazing.I had the pleasure of dining there again with friends this past Sunday. We opted for the 7 course tasting with wine pairings and left the choices up to RW and our waiter Jessie. We all opted for the foie gras which was, of course, served with a golden sauterne but were treated to differnt dishes on most of the other courses. What a pleasure it was to taste so many different choices and the wine pairings by Jessie were excellent.RW has a signature dish that you shouldnt miss: Marcels Boudin Blanc. It is lite, airy and heaven on the tongue. Thankfully Jessie served this to all four of us. It should not be MISSED!We shared courses of salmon, John Dory, Bison, Duck, Lamb, Tuna, Shrimp all with the most delicate sauces, pan juices, purees, mushrooms, bean ragouts and other accoutrements to many to mention. His plating is also a visual delight.The cheese course is sublime only to be followed with fabulous desserts. My favorite the Mocha bar, ice cream cream fraiche cake with chocolate crunchies. The guys loved the cheesecake.The decor is beautifully french and elegant, the staff very well orchestrated, making the whole evening unfold like a beautiful ballet.Im still just trying to figure out why it took me 2 years to return., This place is amazing... When you first walk in, you are greeted by 3-4 people awaiting your arrival. Their sommelier is very knowledgeable and they have a great wine selection. Although our server could have been a little more presentable, her service was excellent.I went with the 5-course prix-fixe menu and everything was just as expected. Although the courses are small, they filled me up very quickly and unexpectedly. Will have to go here again soon., Decided on Marcels to celebrate an occasion with a special someone. Couldnt have chosen better. The maitre d was extremely accommodating and sat us 30 minutes before our reservation, since our reservation was so late. Our waiter very well versed in the menu and in pairings, and guided us through the rich selection of French inspired haute cuisine.Now as for the food, it was simply sublime. I highly recommend the ahi and risotto dish. We tried the skate (signature dish), which was delicately fried, accompanied by rich sauce that paired lovely with the texture of the skate. It was my first time trying skate, and although the prep was perfect, I was not a fan of the texture of the flesh. I also tried the sea bass, which was an addition in lieu of the red snapper, which was another marvelous dish. We also tried the butternut squash soup (must have). I highly recommend the creme brule for desert. You wont be disappointed. Overall this place gets a 4.5. There really inst a complaint to be had. The $$$ spent was well worth the food and the highly attentive service. And the prices are relatively reasonable considering the quality of the food. One can dine for about $60 (pre-theater) per person, which includes 3 courses. Short of Citronelle, this is about the best French haute cuisine you can find in the city, without the Citronelle costs., Very, very good. Advertised as French Belgian. We viewed in the category of classic French cuisine. The service is outstanding and they go out of their way to accommodate special needs. It is a fixed price menu but diners are allowed to choose any item as an appetizer or entree. You can choose from 3 to 7 courses. The portions are very generous. The lamb tenderloins in phyllo pastry with the cumin madeira lamb sauce was my favorite and most memorable dish.., This place reeks of arrogance. The food isnt worth the price or attitude. Do yourself a favor and walk over to Blue Duck instead., Im really not sure why many people are giving this place five stars. I took my wife here for her birthday and expected much much more from this place. The reason I chose this restaurant was because Michelle Richard had it as one of his favorites. He highlighted the Boudin Blanc as the ticket item here. I usually opt for the largest set menu but my wife selected the 4 course and I did the 5 course meal. The Hawaiian Blue Prawns were very disapointing as they were bland and tasted like they came of of boiling water. The side garnishment (pickled onions or something) were tasty. The two best items on the 5 course meal I selected were the Rock Fish with Baby Turnips. VERY VERY good...and the Boudin Blanc was amazing!!!! I should have ordered this for all five courses. The Pan Seared Tuna was not good at all. While the Lamb wrapped in Phyllo was just ok..the lamb was dry and not moist (and over cooked), the New York strip was VERY delicious (the presentation was excellent as well). The variety cheese sampler was also delicious. The restaurant has its ups and downs. The decor is nice and the space is not large at all. But for the price you are going to spend on the courses and a decent bottle of wine, expect to spend $300+ on a meal. For that kind of price every single review should reflect 4-5 stars with no questions or complaints. While we did enjoy the dinner I will probably not be back as I would much rather spend my money at Citronelle.I do have to say the Bordeaux I chose Chateau Mongravey 2007 was a very fine bottle., This place is good... really really good. The service was fantastic and they have a decent selection of wines by the glass. The one thing keeping me from giving the fifth star is the incredibly small portions. The food is expensive but the portion sizes really do not justify the cost. Everything was delicious, I just needed more of it. We each had three courses and we left hungry and out about $200., my new favorite restaurant. Its fabulous and everything is cooked to perfection. Marcels offers different menu options....I usually have the 3 course $65 dinner . Portions are correct and you leave completely satisfied. The service is wonderful! This is not a cheap restaurant but there is a lot of value here. Highly recommended! Not for kids., First, the good -- service! If I could rank them only on their service, I would give them 6 stars...super attentive staff, great fast service, the team seems cohesive as one unit (which I appreciate) rather than everyone working for their own tips.A second good -- the martinis! If you like slightly stronger than average martinis -- this place is a must. The onions are a bit on the small side, but overall pretty good (and yes, Im a martini peson).And the not so good -- the food. I had the Boudin Blanc as mentioned by many on yelp, and indeed, it was quite unique, the cheese plate was also quite nice, however the rest of my tasting menu fell a bit...flat. The presentation was excellent, but just as you feel the food should explode with flavor, it just sorta sits there., My date and I ate here recently, both opting for the multi course tasting menu paired with wines. Excellent food and service. I highly recommend this West End restaurant., I have been going to restaurants for a treat since I was able to afford the luxury and this place has it all. We were going to the Kennedy Center for Opera and decided to treat ourselves prior to the show by going to Marcels not based on yelp (beause yelp can be wrong with some younger reviewers not knowing quality over quantity) but from word of mouth through a respected friend/colleague. First thing-was greeted by the staff upon entrance and assistance to hang our coats without the pressure of coat fees. We were also greeted by the captain (of services, waitstaff, etc.) who advised us of the course menu, pricing, and made some very good suggestions. We took a long time to decide on the wine and decided on a very nice (expensive) bottle of champaign. We chose the pre-theater menu and since it was the spring menu - we had a nice pairing of veggies and meats. The captain recommended some dessert and we chose different ones to taste. The chef complimented us with a salmon roll to start and with a delightful treat at the end. Since there was only 1 of each, my bf asked if he can bring out another one for me to taste and he did. We were lucky that the owner and head chef was in that time (he rotates among his establishments every day at different times). The captain introduced us and we complimented him and took a picture with him as well. It was an experience and I think well worth the price considering the services, decor, plates, silverware used, the food, the sauces, and the candidness of the captain and owner.Well worth it and some place I will take special guests into town like my parents, relatives and best friends and special occassions in the future. We look forward to try his other more casual establishments in DC in the near future.(A perk is that they have a private service car to take you to and from the Kennedy Center when you tell them you are going to the show. Arrive at KC in style.), To start, the Valet Parking was very convenient. The staff was very friendly throughout our entire visit. My girlfriend and I opted to get the 5 course meal. Every dish was cooked to perfection and everything tastes fantastic. The waiter Jonathan was very polite and knowledgeable about every question we had. It happened to be my birthday, and the owner made it a point to wish me a happy one. The pastry chef personalized my dessert with piped chocolate, They were also very generous offering us each a complimentary appetizer, raspberry champagne, and a dessert sampler. This was an overall terrific experience and we both would recommend this place to anybody. Definitely worth every penny spent!!!!!, My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and it was one of the best presents I have every received. We both had the 5-course tasting menu. If you are going for a special occasion I suggest to Go Big or Go Home. Dining at Marcel is a truly memorable experience and worth every penny. I went over a month ago and still talk about the food! Back to the food...For the first course we had some yummy oyster, mussel, cheesy, caviar goodness! For the second course I had the scallop (delicious) and my boyfriend the lobster pappardelle (rich and yummy). I had the classic boudin blanc for the third course, while my boyfriend had fish (can remember which one). The boudin blanc was smooth and soft but it definitely is an acquired taste. The fourth course blew me out of the water... pork loin wrapped in parma. It was cooked to perfection and served with a fruity sauce on the side that was out of this world. The boyfriend had the bison, like everything else spectacular but he still kept asking for another bite of mine. Last was dessert, I the chocolate chip souffle and he the creme brulee, a perfect ending to our meal., I dined here for my first wedding anniversary last night and it was pretty good. We were greeted and sat immediately in a cozy corner in the back of the restaurant but with a view of the kitchen (which is typically my request). Our waiter was wonderful - he answered all our questions and was helpful with suggestions.The bread that was offered was delicious - I had a very warm whole wheat roll and my husband selected the dark almond slice. The three butters that were placed on the table were delicious - I am a big fan of the roasted garlic butter but also enjoyed the olive butter.We both did the four plate tasting menu. I ordered the diver scallop from the Second Course selections, the Alaskan Halibut from the Third Course selections and the Duck Breast from the Fourth Course selection. My husband ordered the baby arugula salad from the First Course selections, the Spanish Mackerel from the Second Course selections and the Rabbit from the Fourth Course selections. For dessert I ordered the special which was a coconut souffle with key lime ice cream and my husband had the blueberry cobbler with blueberry ice cream. With dessert I ordered a glass of Tawny Port - I selected the Forseca but the Sommelier suggested a different variety. All in all the meal was pleasant but I do have a couple of things that I need to point out where Marcels can improve. It took quite a long time for the waiter team to fill up our water glasses. On my halibut dish, I had three discs of roasted potatoes, one of the three was slightly thicker and therefore did not cook all the way through. On the Spanish Mackerel dish there were roasted zucchini which didnt appear to connect with the rest of the dish and they werent seasoned. I know I mentioned a few things that I think need improvement but I have to emphasize that our waiter was wonderful. He was very personable and we enjoyed talking to him. We look forward to returning and would highly recommend dining at Marcels to celebrate a special occasion!, Marcels is an upscale French-Belgian restaurant. Our waiter was extremely attentive and helped with wine and food pairing. I had the five course tasting menu for $135 plus champagne by the glass since i didnt feel like the whole bottle. The meal was outstanding, by far the best I have eaten in Washington D.C., in all honesty. I chose from over forty dishes, and came up with:- Poached egg on asparagus with wild mushrooms and Hollandaise- Langoustine mousse with langoustine tail, and salmon egg roe- Hazelnut encrusted Halibut with potato and mushroom- Medium-rare bison with mushrooms au jus and polenta cake- Chocolate mousse with blood orange curd, blackberries and blood orange sauceThe meal was delicious. Every dish was superbly presented, and tasted fantastic. The meal was accompanied by olive-infused baguettes and olive butter, and lots of sparkling water. The Sauternes was lovely and the espresso hit the spot. I will definitely go back there., Marcels is old school, traditional, lots of dark wood and substantial furniture but warm and while the wait staff could have been stuffy and rude, they were instead, extremely warm and helpful. We were there before a show at the Kennedy center and multiple people made sure to confirm when we wanted our town car ready so that we arrived on time. We werent too concerned about time because we wanted to be able to enjoy dinner and let them know. Id have to equate the whole experience to a well orchestrated play. They timed everything perfectly and while I choose the 3 course pre-theatre option, my companion choose the 4 course option and they timed everything perfectly. They didnt mind that we were sharing a course and offered additional plates to share the dish. Interestingly, we were able to choose any dish from the menu so you can mix and match however you choose. The waiter even suggested that we both order at least one of the larger dishes that he pointed out to get the best deal. Everything was cooked well and we were surprised to find that the waiter was knowledgeable about the wine list and was able to suggest a pairing. It was a 2000 Bordeaux that went exceptionally well with the scallops. We never felt rushed and the service was attentive but not overwhelming. The town car was waiting for us when we were done and at the front waiting for us when the concert was over. It was a nice little touch to make the night special., Marcels is as marvel as I remember. The service is excellent and outstanding from the moment we arrive. The charming Adnan had greeted us at the door with his warmest welcome, and take us in to our fantastic table, embracing my return to the restaurant with two glass of champagne for me and my date. And the food is definitely as amazing as I remember. It is an absolute reassurance since the top notch Chef Robert Wiedmaier is the best in town, my favorite. :)Not forget to mention, thanks to our fantastic waiter Jess, that has been impressively to make sure our dining experience as amazing as I expected and unforgettable. If you havent experience Marcels, I highly recommend for you to. The extravagant dining experience that will enhance your romance. Come elegant and dressy, be a King and Queen for the night in your romantic dinner date at Marcels.And let to the piano play the love song...L is for the way you look at me...O is for the only one I see...V is very very extraordinary...E is even more than anyone that you adoreAnd love is all that I can give to youLove is more than just a game for twoTwo in love can make itTake my heart but please dont break itLove was made for me and youLove is made for me and you Marvelous Marcels!, Eh. If you like having options, Marcel is the place for you. Not only is the menu Cheesecake Factory-esque in the number of dishes, you also have many choices as to how you eat them--three, four, five, or seven (I think) tasting courses, in any order, from any section of the menu, OR anything on the menu as an appetizer or entree. Not to be a total dork, but that number of permutations is mind-blowing!Sadly, I think for this reason Marcel suffers from lack of focus. There were a few real winners, and I think if you choose wisely you can dine well there. The seared diver scallop on pork belly with smoked apricot was FANTASTIC. Most times Ie had pork belly it tasted a lot like bacon, but this one was almost rib-like. I sopped up every bit of the sauce with my dinner roll. The boudin blanc was also amazing, as should be something that a) contains pheasant and b) has been *hand whipped for 3 hours* (seriously). The flavors were a bit too fall-like for July, but I will forgive R.W. because it is one of the restaurantsstaples and scrumdiliumptious. (And apparently a good source of hazing in this teaching kitchen.) The trio of flavored butters that came with the bread were also pretty good, as was the cheese selection. Solid dishes, although not particularly memorable, were the bison and the duck. The accompaniments to the cheese course were not bad, but uninspired--glazed walnuts and raisins. Woohoo.The rabbit terrine, however, made me sad. This is my favorite protein, but I am sorry to report that no bunnies should have died to make that dish. It was chunkier than I think a terrine should be, and frankly, I do not think the blackberry sauce worked. Perhaps another berry would have worked better, but somehow the blackberries paired with the rabbit ended up just tasting medicinal. It also was not a particularly appealing looking dish--a hunk of mushy, pink-gray in a pool of reddish-purplish sauce. I think the desert was a fail too--the apricot upside-down cake tasted like Fruit Loops, and they must have taken the toasted part of the toasted almond ice cream part seriously, because it was so melty when it arrived at our table that I couldn even taste it.Although the servers are friendly, knowledgeable and gracious, the service is slooooow. It took forever to get our menus, and to get each course--I think we spent nearly 2.5 hours on five courses, the last two of which were shared among three of us.I might go back, but only if someone else were paying, and I would stick to a single entree of the scallops or boudin blanc. I also would probably have a snack before hand, because the portions are not exactly generous. And this is coming from someone who wears extra-smalls.(x-posted to blog), Went here on my anniversary.It is a nice restaurant, but I find their menu concept a bit confusing. You pay for the number of courses, but then you can pick your courses in any order, while the menu has a first, second, third, etc. Doing it this way also makes a dessert or a salad the same price as an entree, since you basically can one in lieu of the other. Also with the way the menu is here, it is a bit tougher to know what you are getting, since they use fancy terms of calling an item. I also prefer more of a prix frixe menu where you picked 1 from each category instead of picking any items on the menu regardless of category or order. I went for a 4 course meal ($80) with the last item being dessert. All 4 items were great. I started out with the Gratin of Oyster, Mussel, and Cockles, Tomato Fondue, Crispy Parma, Oyster Cream, and then went on to the Sweet Soy Glazed Beaver Creek Quail, Bok Choy, Julienne Carrots, then the Martins Prime Angus Filet Mignon, Asparagus, Meaux Mustard Sauce, and finished it off with the Chocolate Banana Mousse Bar, Chocolate Sorbet As I mentioned earlier, I felt a bit guilty about ordering the dessert, knowing I could get another entree and it would still cost the same. I also would have gotten a cheese course if I didnt feel it would be as much as an entree type course.Overall though, all the food is good, and I would recommend this place., After reading many (not all) reviews of this marvelous restaurant I found that some had confusion over the menu.. I never look at one when Im dining here! The way to experience Marcels is to let the Captain know what kinds of things you like and dislike and let them take the helm from there! As far as the wine.. Moez & Adnane know which wines go with particular courses best so let them choose for you! Marcels is a dining experience and not your everyday restaurant (unless your name is on a brass plaque on the first bar stool). The Boudin Blanc is a dish that is not to be missed- If they have a lobster dish with pasta Get it! I have not had a dish here that was just OK. Even the salad is sensational!, The food, drinks, and service are all impeccable. I was blown away by how friendly and helpful the servers were --- I left feeling like the waiter was my new best friend. Id definitely go back here for a special occasion, or really any occasion - its THAT good., Robert b says it best. This is a dining experience. Fist you need to be prepared to spend some serious cash for this dinner. Secondly you need to chill and just enjoy the evening. It wont be fast and it wont be cheap so if these are your criterion dont go here. It will be fantastic. The Chef is to totally dedicated to the best food and the best service. You will get both here. We have been to Marcels at a private party and numerous dinners. It is our absolute favorite dining experience between Miami and Boston on the east coast. Go. Enjoy. You wont be disappointed., We were here for our anniversary, and this place had one of the best food ever. Id compare this place to LeBernardin in NYC...Id say Marcels was a bit better. Maybe because Im into French cuisine...I had the four course meal...I had the bison and scallop course. The sauce on the scallop was so delicious...almost similar to pesto flavor, but of course there was more to it. The cheese course was also very good. It came out with a small slice of bread. Im not a big cheese fan, but it was still very appetizing!I cant dine here too often because its expensive, but definitely recommend for any special occasion or for anyone who simply needs great french course dinner!, Whenever anyone asks me what the best restaurant in the District is, I say with great enthousiasm and without a moments hesitation: Marcels!The atmosphere is simple but so charming: great lighting, comfortable seating, pleasant decoration, nice-looking crowd. My dining partner and I each had a five-course menu which was, from start to finish, pretty astounding. Just really a wow experience! Great, great wine list: ask your server for a recommendation.Speaking of the servers, at Marcels they are the best youre going to find anywhere. Johnathan the maitre d deserves enormous praise: he took care of us for the evening and I was blown away with his service. Truly an asset to the restaurant and a blessing to us diners!Dress well, grab a boyfriend, girlfriend, or whatever, be prepared to spend some money (worth every penny!) and get thee to Marcels!, I believe that this is the best restaurant that DC has to offer. It is extremely nice and a little pricey. The people who work there enjoy what they do and it shows. The food was spot and served perfectly. I would have not done anything different. They also have something for every palate. Enjoy!, If you have a special occation and are looking for a top notch place to go, Marcels is that.... Marcels is a special occation in itselt. The staff makes you feel like a king, the wine is delicious, and the food literally melts in your mouth. The lobster bisque is a must if you go. THe only Con i can think of is the price. Just be ready to open up your wallet.... and youll enjoy., This restaurant was easily one of the best dining experiences I have had in a long time. I enjoyed the tremendous flexibility they offer in their menu. You can have a 3, 4, 5, or 7-course tasting menu. When picking each course, you can also pick multiple selections from the same course if desired. Alternatively, you can just pick off the menu a la carte. I can remember all the pricing, but we had the 4-course and it was $80 per.As recommended on yelp, the boudin blanc was fantastatic. The service was top-flight. The waitstaff was knowledgeable and eager to explain the menu. In addition, frequent attention was the norm. Delivery of the food was done with excellent presentation and formality.A must go in the DC area., I am new to yelp but I got engaged here on 7/27/08 and wanted to give credit to this restaurant. I originally reviewed the restaurant on open table 2 years ago and then went back in July of 2009 and once again had an outstanding experience. Here is the original review-This restaurant is absolutely phenomenal. From there delicious food to accommodating my boyfriends clever marriage proposal. Whether you are celebrating a special occasion or just looking for a romantic place to eat you will feel pampered. I enjoyed a four-course meal that became increasingly more appetizing. So if your looking to indulge in mouth-watering French cuisine and are interested in an overall delightful evening this is the spot for you., Went to Marcel last night for the pre-theatre dinner. AMAZING! The three course selection is anything off of the main menu which means you could potentially order three desserts, three cheeses or three mains if you choose. The meal started with an amuse bouche--I received a venison square and my friend got a lamb croquette-both really good. For dinner I went for the lobster bisque en croute, which was a special for the evening--a wonderful presentation for a soup that had a beautiful pastry on top and delicate chunks of lobster in the sherry and creamy broth, the pheasant which had a wonderful crispy skin, and the duck which was perfectly medium rare. My friend also had the lobster bisque, a huge diver scallop and the fois gras with blackberries which were wonderful. Three courses is more than enough food--I can imagine going through 5, let alone 7. To top things off we each had a lovely espresso that arrived with cute sugar sticks. As a nice treat, a tray of 5 petit fours(chocolates, biscotti and pate a fruit) came out our way. So it worked out that I didn get dessert :) Its a pricier option than many other pre-theatre dinners at $58/person, but for the quality of food and amazing service its totally worth it. I was delighted by the fact that at no point was the wait staff pretentious or snobby--they wanted to make sure our meal was enjoyed. Would recommend to anyone celebrating a special occasion. And the bonus? A complementary ride over to the Kennedy Center. Doesn get much better than this., I really thought they had mussels like the sister restaurants! But it was still a great meal :) They have several pre-fix options but you can order a la carte as well. I started with the lobster parpadelle, followed by lamb tendrloin in phyllo dough and then chocolate bar with pistachio.We went on a random Tuesday night but this place is definitely meant for special occasions., went last night for our anniversary dinner. First let me say the maitre d greeted us nicely and wished us a happy anniversary, so things were off to a good start already. The ambiance is romantic and reminded me a fine restaurant we went to in Paris last winter. The pianist adds a touch of elegance to the room and everyone seems to wear their best dressed. Weve been to several places with tasting menus and what makes this stand out is how were able to switch our courses out of the many selections they have off the menu, theres no restriction to it at all. The dishes were simply delicious, they were brilliantly presented, each came out at perfect temperature and felt like they melted in your mouth. My favorite of the night was the Duck Breast, each morsel of meat was cooked to perfection and the gamey taste really came through each bite. Overall heres my opinion, if you like French romance, French food and great service this is your spot. Our head captain Jonathan was very pleasant throughout service and made us feel like our night was extra special. Even customized our dessert souffle plate to say Happy 4 year anniversary written in chocolate. :), Went to dinner on Friday to celebrate the end of grad school. Restaurant has a nice atmosphere and most diners were mature...probably Gen Y people like me can afford to eat here on a regular basis. The service is fantastic and flawless. They promptly asked sparkling or still and if we wanted to see the wine menu. The wine menu is extensive and impressive, leaning towards the expensive (not too many wines under $80 per bottle). The meal is served based on a tasting menu concept. There are a few entrees that can be ordered a la carte, but what the point of going to Marcel if youe not going to try the tasting menu. I opted for a five-course w/ no cheese or dessert option: Amuse bouche - very good...bigger than one mouthful, but not complaining. foie gras - nice large portion (special that night - $12 extra charge) sole - perfectly cooked and fairly large portion  ahi tuna - fairly large portion...by this time, I was almost full because all of the portions were larger than I had expected from a tasting menu...  boudin blanc (the right size portion) because it their specialty - maybe I had eaten too much already because it didn live up to expectations. It was light and delicate, but maybe too delicate because it could have been more flavorful venison - perfectly cooked. Too bad I was already full to enjoy all of it.Lesson learned: Get 3 or 4 courses unless Ie starved myself for a week.Definitely recommend going here..especially if someone else volunteers to pick up the bill!, For fancy restaurants in DC, this is easily top 3 if not #1 in my book. Nice location (Washington Circle) allows for a walk through Georgetown after dinner. The bar at Marcels is nice, not too big, but good for a drink before dinner. The atmosphere is the restaurant is very nice...fancy but not stuffy. The service is really fantastic. Very well trained and friendly. Not too snoody and not too intrusive. I have not had a thing to eat there that was not out of the world delicious. My favorite is the lamb tenderloin wrapped in filo dough. Great wines too. Though a top end fancy restaurant, the prices are not astronomical. 5 stars plus., If youe looking for great French food, this is THE place in the DC metro area (better than Luberge Chez Francois in Great Falls). I hate getting in a suit for anything but work, but it worth it.You can choose from a 3 to 7 course dinner. Unless you want your pant buttons to burst or don eat as much as a horse, stick with 3 to 5 courses.One of the specials they had the night we were there was foie gras - it was amazing. My wife is not a fan of foie gras yet, she loved it.If youe looking for great French wine to go with your dinner, youe got a huge selection of great wines to choose from. We let our server choose a moderately priced one that would go best with what we ordered. He was on point - the wine was excellent and went very well with our meal.The service was excellent. The waiter(s) was on top of things yet, not in your face or hovering over your table. If you needed someone attention, a simple look in the direction of any wait staff for a matter of a few seconds was all it took for someone to notice and come to your table.Note: It ain cheap. The dinner is pricey and the wine is even more pricey (the wine selection is amazing).Great place to take your other half on a date night. Also good if you want to impress someone and/or lead them to believe youe wealthy (even if youe not).
39|mari-vanna-washington|Mari Vanna is a nice new edition to the Farragut North bar scene. It is a russian themed restaurant and bar, which means the bar is stocked with flavored vodkas (yay! the horseradish in particular) and baltika beer (eh).The thing I like about the bar in particular is the atmosphere- it is both cozy and bright, with a pleasant colorful russian touch. A nice place to pop in and sit. The food right now is only small plates, but I will be back to update this review when they have a little more substantial menu., I am so excited about Mari Vanna opening in DC - I had been to their New York restaurant multiple times and really enjoyed it. The DC one is bigger and better, and has a delightful atmosphere. The food, albeit for the time being available only from a limited menu (the grand opening is on January 17th), was delicious. The vodkas were tasty, the staff very friendly, and I cannot wait to go back. And the old schoolback to the USSR feel is nice., Mari Vanna is a beautifully decorated, three-story, Russian themed establishment. I was lucky enough to attend a private promotional event there last night, filled with complimentary finger food and drinks. So keep in mind, I find it difficult to complain about something I havent paid for. But whatever a night here costs, Im guessing itd be worth every penny.The decor is intricate, elegant and warm. It creates an atmosphere perfect for a date, a friendly dinner or just a night out for drinks. I cant imagine college kids stepping foot here, meaning the Mari Vannas crowd will (hopefully) remain fabulous. The first floor floor has a large bar and open kitchen, with bar and table seating. The second is a balcony that overlooks the first floor, with table seating. The third has a smaller bar, table and couch seating, with an area for a DJ table. The drinks were strong, the bartenders were quick and the food was tasty. Ill have to come back for dinner to get the full experience, but Im confident when I say this is the next it spot in the District., Instant classic. The horseradish martini they make will change your life., Beautiful place, great food but reservations are highly suggested, especially during weekends., Some friends and I stumbled upon Mari Vanna while looking for dinner in Dupont. We were drawn in by the cozy, beautiful decor and stayed for over three hours because we just couldnt stand the thought of leaving such a pleasant place. Id never had Russian food, so I cant compare it to anything beyond saying every dish exceeded my expectations. We tried blinis (a first for me and absolutely exquisite paired with their prosecco), borscht (delicious and warming on a freezing night), herring under a fur coat (not my favorite, but those who liked it really loved it), home-style potatoes (perfectly seasoned and cooked) and quail. Our waiter, Dmitry, was attentive without pressuring us to order more or leave and helped us appreciate the dishes from a true Russian perspective. The manager also came by to make us feel welcome.It was a perfect dinner experience all around. Highly recommend this place for a date, dinner with mom or gathering of friends!, Mari Vanna, what a nice addition to DC bar/dining scene! Beautiful inside out. Beautiful people, big open kitchen, great food, homey interior especially on the second floor, charmingly decorated bathrooms, superior service, an accordion music entertainment, and the dance floor bar on the third floor with nice club music. Looked like my group was the only non-Russian and made us feel like as if we were in Russia. Their free candies are strawberry flavor and really nice too.The food we tried this evening were:* complementary bread that came with scallions, radish and small bowl of sunflower oil. * Borsch* Pirozhok (a set of three - cabbage, meat, potato/egg?)* Beef Stroganoff with Buckwheat KashaAnd some Russian beer and Horseradish Vodka Shots.I would say everything we tasted were excellent, considering this was our second dinner for the night. :)Cant wait to try more of their food and drinks very soon!, Having lived in Eastern Europe for a few years I was excited to try Mari Vanna. However, I was less than blown away. The menu was very limited (may be due to the fact that it recently opened) and the item my wife ordered was not available. The food we did have was decent but overpriced. The vodka selection is one of the best I have ever seen and the horseradish vodka was awesome. The restaurant itself is pretty, but very compact. I am unlikely to go back., Mari Vanna is one of kind Russian doll house with so much positive energy and cheers. Food was great. Relatively small portion (compared to TGI Fridays) but you dont come here to get stuffed. You come here to enjoy the ambiance and have good drinks and get cheered up with music played by garmoshka (instrument). You can even dance polka if you are in the mood. At Mari Vanna, you are in Russia. Follow their rules. Drink, laugh and just have fun! You might get lucky to sit at the table next to Ovechkin (like me)!!Before you leave, look around and enjoy the details.. small pots every corner, lovely chandeliers, old fashioned glasses, pictures on the wall.. *Highlight of the house: Little girls room... It is so lovely ... You should visit even if you dont need to go p... :) *PS: Dress appropriately. Most people are dressed up well here., Great place, decor, food (being Russian, I can appreciate its quality and authenticity), drinks (though cocktails are a little overpriced). But I afraid that I won go there again. We were overcharged, and when asked about it, were given some lame excuse. I understand that the place is new and servers might not be fully trained yet, but I have a feeling that, in fact, this is service as usual for a Russian restaurant. It makes me sad since I was happy and willing to support a Russian business In DC. I wish them best of luck., Decor - 5 starsService - 3 stars - this one i have to explain. When we got there, the 2d floor only had 4 parties seated. we had a mixup with our reservation, it was 3 of us, but the host thought we reserved table for 2. the hostess walked us over to a 2-person table and asked if it was OK. When we stood there in shock, she sat us at a larger table. In about 10 minutes the hostess approached us again and asked us to move to another table, she explained that they needed our table for a larger party. We were clearly annoyed, but decided to comply. (the table we moved from was never seated during or entire visit). Meanwhile no one has even asked us for a drink order, at this point we were at the restaurant for 25 minutes. The waitress, Masha, was very friendly, and helpful - I would give her alone 5+++ starts. As soon as we got our drinks and ordered our entrees, the manager brought us 1 bottle of beer (which we did not order), I guess it was a gift. We dont drink, so we declined. A few minutes later another person brought us 2 dessert cakes. That was a nice gesture, but we have not even gotten our appetizers, and were so hungry, so we ended up eating the dessert before we got any food. Once our food arrived, everything was great from then on. I d say overall the service needs work.Food - 5 starsGreat Lamb, and sea bass . Great home made desserts. I only wish they had a variety of soft drinks and juices. Freshly squeezed juices would be even better :) . The home-made potatoes (potatoes with mushrooms) are highly overpriced in my opinion. There is also no selection for kids. Just the regular adult menu, which is somewhat limited. Ambiance - 5 stars., This place has a very genuine sense of decor and authenticity to Eastern Europe. However, the service is less than accommodating. Celebrating the birthday party of my best friend, we were asked to leave for a bogus private party because few of my friends were dancing around our table. We were asked to leave because the entire floor was reserved for a private event at 10:30pm. Interestingly, none of the wait staff knew about the private event and no other table was asked to leave. A very impatient bouncer (Tito) escorted one of my friends because he didn pick up his jacket fast enough, even when the rest of us were trying to close our tabs. When asked to speak to the manager, Mr. K. D. Brown defended his employee deceiving tactics, even when he realized these were not in the best interest of the restaurant. I feel the restaurant has the right concept of decorating the place but it needs better customer service from his manager to stimulate customers to return by avoiding circumstances that compromise the integrity and essence of providing quality service to us - the patrons.I will not return nor I will recommend., Awesomely warm, fun decor. Would not hesitate going back at all.Is this what Russias like? Because if it is, then I was grossly misinformed. I loved the environment, and I think itd be a great place for happy hours or bday parties (given lots of comfy seating). Honestly the food didnt appeal to me all that much, because it just didnt sound appetizing. But then again I know next to nothing about eastern European food. The only other knock was the service... They were super friendly, so no knock there, but they could have been more attentive. At first taking our orders they were great, but there was just too many lulls in between that and the check., Many restaurants claim to be authentic. And, in many instances, menus are utilized to illustrate that same point, the point of being authentic. However, the authenticity of a menu is as simple as putting the correct entr39e names on a piece of paper, the devil, I afraid is in the execution. And, it is in the execution that many authentic restaurants fail miserably. To contrast those miserable attempts and failures is the menu, as well as the cuisine, at Mari-Vanna. An unassuming restaurant on Connecticut, one need only look inside to realize that Mari-Vanna is different than its cookie cutter neighbors whose menus and interiors are driven by minimalistic, contemporary city architecture, faux-fusion cuisine, and whatever the last interior post-industrialist trend is. Mari-Vanna, in every single aspect, is unlike any place one might have been to in Washington D.C., simply because there are no other places like it in Washington D.C. The unassuming glass door allows entry into a warm and inviting first floor of a restaurant that takes one away to a village somewhere in Russia taken not from real life, but from the likes of a postcard with a picture of a place that should exist, but by all accounts does not, unless one is on Connecticut Avenue that is. Having arrived at five thirty olock, the first floor was packed to the brim with patrons and curious first-timers. I looked upon the crowd with some dismay as I was hungry and a table was nowhere to be found, until I looked up and saw a second floor with ample room available. I was promptly led by the extremely polite hostess, Julia, to my table and was introduced to my waitress Anya. I was given a menu that claimed to be po-domashnemu (like at home) right on the cover. Having just arrived from Ukraine two weeks ago, I was yearning for even a shadowy glimpse of that familiar cuisine. Having been to Russia House the week before and leaving sorely disappointed, I must admit my expectations were low. As such, I eagerly flipped through my menu and looked upon dishes that were of extreme familiarity. I quickly began to realize that as I turned the pages a very carefully planned feast was beginning to unfold in the contents of the menu.I began my selection by ordering Mors, a cranberry punch, which I half expected to be watered down and half hoped would at least be drinkable, a bottle of Vueve Clicquot, just as a precaution, a small shot of Nemiroff LEX vodka, and a glass of water. For my appetizer I ordered the Pickled Herring with Baby Boiled and Seasoned Potatoes, and Rye bread toastettes; as well as, the Blini, the Russian version of a crepe, with Salmon Caviar and Sour Cream. I eagerly waited for the appetizers, as the Blini and the Herring would more or less tell the whole story. After all, they are the basic staples of Russian cuisine. To my surprise the first plate to arrive was a simple bread board with Rye Bread and Dark Rye bread with baked in Cranberries, it was served with young green onions, radishes, sunflower oil and salt for dipping. I have never seen a more classic and authentic presentation of this before. I was beginning to become excited with the prospect that Mari-Vanna may in fact have some potential. My Mors and water immediately followed. The glass of Mors was bright red and smelled of fresh Cranberries, taking a sip I realized that this was in fact real pressed Cranberry juice, combined with sugar and water, just as it should be, just as I had in Ukraine only a few short weeks ago. After a few more minutes my Herring and vodka arrived. Served in a jar with onions, oil, and vinegar, the pickled Herring was more buttery and sweet than it was fishy, just as properly prepared Herring should be. On the side were slices of young potato, sliced thin enough to compliment the Herring, but not so thin as to become lost in the buttery flavor. I immediately drank a bit of the vodka and followed it up with a piece of herring with onions and potato. The flavor was unmistakable, without a doubt I had made the right choice. The dish was so simple yet so flavorful; I could hardly wait for my plate of Blini as I wanted to continue my experience., Mari Vanna was an unexpectedly nice discovery in Washington, DC. The food was delicious, although somewhat overpriced. The service was excellent - very friendly and accommodating staff. The drinks were perfect. The main reason I am giving the place an okay is the stuffiness upstairs. I had to leave early because it was impossibly stuffy. If they do something with their ventilation system, I am sure, many patrons would be much happier., Has anyone had the experience of fraudulent charges after using their card at this place? I had charges made online for Saks!, We were seated right away and the whole night the servers were very attentive. Our drink and food orders were taken promptly and the servers took away used plates quickly. The decor was beautiful and the ambiance was very pleasant. The food is on the pricey side, but definitely tastes authentic and is very good quality. The only thing I noted that was not very authentic is the portion size - Russian meals at home with the family are much more family style and not tapas. The bilinis for desert were a perfect finish to our meal. My favorite part of the experience was when a server noticed my purse was on the floor and asked if I wanted a stool for it - what a gem., Food is not exactly the most amazing Russian fare ever (coming from a Russian native), but it certainly not bad. Russia House doesn even come close to this place in food quality. Mari Vanna has a good selection, and great service, but the best thing about this restaurant is the ambiance and atmosphere. It so cozy and warm - you won want to leave! Props to everyone there who works hard to make it a comforting and authentic experience. Best thing on the menu: the dessert blinchiki (crepe-like pastries). Other things worth trying: herring under fur coat salad, pirozhki, and chicken kotleti. I coming back to try the borsh and pelmeni!, What is the point of making a reservation if you dont get seated until an hour later? This was even though there were open tables in the back of the restaurant. Apparently, you need to know the right people to get seated here. While most restaurants would be appropriately apologetic for such a failure, the hosts/managers were completely nonchalant, and acted as if it was our privilege to get a table there when or if they decided on it. This place has serious kinks to work out in terms of service. Our waiter was no better. We didnt receive two of the dishes we had ordered and there were large lapses of time where he seemed to disappear ...its too bad... the food (when we actually received it) was good and the atmosphere was delightful. The poor service completely ruined it!, I am a native Russian, so my review may be skewed just a tad. I went to Mari Vanna on a Wednesday night with 3 American girlfriends. Overall, DC needed a place like this because Russia House (and I say that as a dedicated patron) was not living up to the name AT ALL. I am starting with the CONS because this is how my night started out, but the PROS definitely made up for everything.CONS: * We had reservations at 8pm, but did not get seated until 9pm (even though a few tables remained empty, but reserved)* After we waited for an hour to sit, a whole bunch of tables opened up as well (so I would definitely recommend a reservation on the later side, close to 9pm (or something super early like 6pm) to avoid waiting)* There was no space at the bar, so we just sort of lingered for an hour* The whole place is a Russian-style chaos (but see this as a PRO below)* Once we sat down, it was impossible to get our waiter attention - he was moving around quickly, but also sort of aimlessly (instead of writing stuff down, he just memorized orders, messed them up, and ran, I assume, back and forth from the kitchen to fix his screw-ups)* The place is super loud, so if you are planning on catching up or having a romantic time, this is not a place to go* The drinks are $25 a piece (healthy size martinis, but def not fishbowls as one would hope for the price)* Since they just opened up, the menu is abbreviated - compared to the menu they have in NYC/Moscow/St Petersburg, they prob only offer 20% of the usual menu* No chef tasting menu, like in NYC, so you have to order items individually* Desserts are prepared with pre-made industrial-style crusts (or maybe the whole thing is outsourced to a factory), so I didn like them. But my girlfriends thought they were good. We tried honey cake (Medovik), layer cake (Napoleon), Kiev cake (I didn like that one at all), and non-baked chocolate truffle like balls (Kartoshka).PROS:* If you are after a real Russian experience, this is totally it, including chaos, some friendly/some aloof people with heavy accents* Continuing with the true Russian experience, the place is loud, or should I say bustling and feels like a party - accordion player randomly breaks into a song, they sing real Russian birthday song about Cheburashka, complete with tambourines. . . there was someone birthday celebrated every 20 min, I swear* The drinks were delicious and since we waited for an hour, we got them compd - saved $100 since there were 4 of us and each got a drink* Food was AMAZING . . . and heavy . . . . and really, really Russian. We did not order a single entree, because the main course is not really the main attraction, unless you are talking about peleni, which were not on the menu the night we went. It is all about cold and hot appetizers (zakuskas). We ordered one of each of everything and shared* Herring is yummy (both with rye bread and pod shuboi (in a fur coat))* Meat board was really good * Pierogies (you get: one meat, one cabbage, and one egg/onion) were also good but small. Egg/onion was the most popular.* My fave was salo . . . it is probably outside a comfort zone for some, but you should just go for it . . .it is heaven - it is super tender bacon from a piglet, with rye bread and spicy mustard. You are supposed to load everything together and chase your vodka with it. We had no vodka, but it was still good.* I observed people eat soup (mushroom and Borscht). The bowls are huge, so one would probably be enough for 4 people. If a group of 3 went and ordered 3 soups, to sample and share, they would be close to full after eating just soup. Anyways, all-in-all this place will be a success, I am sure. I would definitely recommend it to my friends. P.S. If you are a Russian expat with access to a Russian store and your mom cookbook, however, you will likely find these prices outlandish., For Russian cuisine in the district, its slim pickings. We have eaten at Russian House once, and once was enough. After having tried the Mari Vanna in NYC, we were excited to see them opening in DC. Valentines Day proved to be a very nice experience for the most part, very fresh, delicious food and infused vodkas. Only advice, service could use some work. Our gentleman server didnt bring us our wine for dinner until we were nearly finished with our meal. Will return., It all started when my friend G-chatted me. Free on Thursday? I want to get a drink at Mari Vanna. At first I was skeptical. A quick review of the website promised overly floral, grandma style decor and a menu that had nothing to draw me in. BUT, the yelp reviews were great and I knew that I had try the horseradish martini. I mean, seriously, how could I pass that up?Cue, Thursday night. I stepped through the front door of Mari Vanna and immediately knocked over two very tall, very skinny blondes wearing very tall high heels. The bar was packed and my friend was risking her life to guard a chair at the bar for me. First thoughts: not my scene. However, the whole night was a series of wonderful and pleasant surprises. We made a meal of appetizers that were delicious and OH MY GOD the drinks! Every cocktail is worth the $14 price tag and if you have the tolerance for it, the shots of infused vodkas are unbelievable. The bartenders were friendly and attentive and pour very generously. I thought it couldn better but it did - they have an accordion player who comes out at the top of the hour to play a couple songs. By the end of the night the general manager himself had come over to talk to us and invited us up to their third floor lounge which is gem in Dupont. It dark, cozy, and romantic and would be a GREAT second date spot. I highly recommend Mari Vanna. Even if you think it wouldn be your style, give it a shot and you might be surprised! I know I was!, Decor is very appealing and dacha-like. Impeccable service. However, it a pity that the food is nothing special. They use sunflower oil for cooking to be authentic, I guess, but it doesn taste that good in all the dishes. For the price they charge I rather eat at Range or Rasika. I had the cabbage vitamin salad that reminded of my kindergarten times with all the sunflower oil they poured into it. Yes, it did feel nostalgic, but not at $15 for an appetizer. The smoked salmon was too smoked on the top and half done inside. The desserts were amazing though with very good tea serving it the Russian train way. I would recommend coming there for drinks and desserts at the bar. Once again, the decor and ambiance are very pleasant., Food/decor was amazing. Authentic Russian food, great cocktails, and incredible desserts. We shared 4 appetizers, 2 entrees and 2 dessert between 5 people and were satisfied. I would have given them 4 stars solely based on food and decor, but the service was painfully slow. I asked 4 different staff memebers to please refill our water. I had gone downstairs right after ordering dessert and asked to have a candle/something special on the dessert for our 2 friends who got engaged, and even though they said theyd take care of us, we were just given our dessert as it is.. All about the food, yes it is on the pricey side, but you go knowing what the price would be so cant complain there. Id love for them to pay attention to service and it would be perfect!, Love It! Great service, good food and lovely atmosphere...cant go wrong on this adventure!, Great staff, good vodka, although the drinks are a little expensive. I would recommend the place if you like russian food though, the food was great. You are going to pay for it though., Ive only tried Mari Vanna for their cocktails and pickles - and I definitely enjoyed both! I really enjoy vodka cocktails and pickles! So Mari Vanna was a perfect fit for an after dinner drink and snack. I dont think there is much on the menu that is vegan-friendly besides the pickles, but they definitely do mark which items are vegetarian, which I definitely appreciated, especially for Americans who are not particularly familiar with Russian food. I had a pear cocktail, which was delicious though a bit spendy. Id love to come back to try the horseradish vodka - maybe not straight up, but in a cocktail. The pickle plate had an assortment of veggies, including cucumbers and tomatoes. The veggies werent overly pickled - the could have been pickled even more for my taste! My friend ordered a different cocktail and a dessert, which he enjoyed.The bartender was very friendly and was eager to offer suggestions and explain the menu to us. We were on the third floor, which had a nice feel to it - space to lounge at tables or the bar. The third floor bar wasnt very crowded for a Thursday night, though the first two floors were pretty full. I cant wait to try more vodka cocktails! They infuse their own vodka and definitely have some interesting flavors!, This place truly had turned into an old ladys drawing room, with extremely rude security staff. An individual called Mr. Chico reprimanded me for ordering drinks at the bar, standing around the side instead of the crowded front of the bar. While he could have asked me respectfully, he chose to do this extremely rudely. When the bar tender had no trouble taking my drink order, this guy had the nerve to tell the bar tender not to serve me! Needless to say, I wont be going back. Also, based on the crowd that was there, I wont be missing anything. Plenty of other places in DC for me to spend my money and get polite service., Mari Vanna has authentic russian food, served in a charming living-room decor. For starters, my husband and I got the herring under a fur coat - don let the name dissuade you from trying it, there no fur mixed in with this dish. It a very delicious layer of herring topped with shredded beets and eggs (the ur coat. For entrees, my husband had the pirozhok, about three baked dough buns stuffed with various ingredients, and a bowl of 10-15 pelmini, which are steamed dumplings filled with moist, minced veal. For me, it was the quail, which actually was two quail, somewhat boney, but stuffed with small pieces of pine nuts and pear. However, the highlight of the night, for me, was the blini with cured salmon and sour cream. The blini were light but substantial enough to hold a layer of cream and fresh slices of salmon. It is a must-order if you like salmon, and was somewhat of a mix between dinner and dessert (we passed on dessert). As you can tell, we ordered a lot, which was testimony to the relatively modest portion sizes. The food was not cheap (the one thing that makes me hesitate giving it 5 stars), but where else can you find authentic russian cuisine. As someone whose mother-in-law is a Russian cook, I can testify to the authenticity and high quality of the food (even if it may not be up to her caliber). Our waitress was attentive, and the restaurant at 7ish on a Saturday was not too loud. We will have to come back, though the prices are such that it will probably be saved for a special occasion., Goodbye boyfriend! I am taking my things and moving to Mari Vanna. I mean, how can you not fall in love with the mismatched china, shabby chic furniture, antique white chandeliers and the cheery prints on the server uniforms.It like they made a restaurant out of my dreams!I was in the city one summer day and was pulled in by the mini garden patio they had up front. I was neither hungry, nor had the time to stop in but everything looked so happy inside that I had to take a peek! $19 gets you a prix-fixe lunch that contains a soup and entree combo which is a great deal since a bowl of their borsch soup will set you back twelve ducks by itself. Since it was my first time eating Russian food, the waitress recommended I try the borsch and chicken stroganoff. My only knowledge of borsch is from the episode of the Rugrats when Tommy Pickles grandmother spilled it all over the kitchen so I had no idea what to expect. What came out was a slightly warm beet soup with tender beef cubes floating around. It was not super flavorful but it had a subtle sweet taste and a little extra crunch from stray beets. The chicken stroganoff came out over a brown rice/quinoa like grain. It was warm, hearty and perfect for a rainy day. What really impressed me was the service. They were attentive, friendly and helpful. At the end of my meal she presented me my check with a little Russian chocolate and a small traditional woven bag. To reference another nineties television show: My name is A.C. Slater and the A.C. stands for absolutely charmed!, Food is ok...depends how busy the restaurant is...the busier they are the worst the food gets....My beef strogonoff came out room temp. Service is all over the place...they are young and friendly but totally overwhelmed when the night is busy...its worth a try but not necessarily a return, I stopped by Mari Vanna on a Friday evening. What a great addition to the neighborhood! It really serves the untapped market of upscale casual (vs divey bars) restaurant/bars in the area. The decor is very kitschy and cute. Their TVs played Russian movies and the clientele was also pretty Russian. All staff members were very nice to me. The most funny part of the evening was the Russian, seemingly regular who sat next to me. As he saw my puzzled face looking at these foreign options he took it upon himself to offer me suggestions. I liked that he was so serious about his recommendations and he treated us like neighbors.  I had the strawberry cocktail which the bartender recommended. I was a little nervous to try this one since strawberry cocktails can just be really terrible, especially when made using syrup. Ick. However, my drink was delish! I think they used some type of infused vodka. The drink was sweet but not too sweet in the syrupy way. I left very pleased and cant wait to come back for dinner sometime!, Went for happy hour and stayed for dinner. First of all, it is as authentic as it is going to get. Seriously, tasted like my mom made my meal (which I can never get her to do these days). It is a little on the pricey-er side, expect to have to spend some $. Drinks - pickle vodka, horseradish vodka, specialty cocktails all taste like heaven. Seriously, make sure you get a couple of shots of the house infused vodkas in you. I was taught by my lovely Russian family to sip my straight vodka shots so thats what I do, goes great with the food. I ordered blini (blinchiki - russian style pancakes) with beef and sour cream. My friends got ones with salmon and caviar. Absolutely delicious. Perfectly thin and 100% how I would have made them at home. For main course I got pelmeni with beef and pork (Russian dumplings, served with sour cream). They have a tendency to get soggy especially if too much sour cream and these were just perfect! Highly recommend. Next time ordering more things and sharing them all. Decor - just adorable, super Russian, down to the cups. Look forward to going back...often., Adorable decor, adorable staff, adorable outfits on staff. Had a cabbage and pork soup -- light, at the same time full and flavorful. Also tried the beef stew with prunes over mashed potatoes. Great homemade taste. Really fresh dill here., Wonderful Russian food in a beautiful atmosphere. Service is excellent and knowledgeable in the food and the language (she was Russian). Looking forward to returning!!, Love love love Mari Vanna! From the very first moment I stepped in the restaurant and was surrounded by china, photos, wallpaper, and tables like my great-grandmothers home, I liked the vibe. Then when the accordion player arrived playing music that you couldnt help but clap your hands to, the amazingness of the evening was solidified. And I hadnt even eaten or drank anything yet. I got the cucumber gin martini to drink, which was not too sweet and very delicious. Then we got the salmon/cream cheese blinis to start, which were SO good, and I got the potato vareniki (pierogies), which were filling and delicious. And I only wish I had enough room to finish the honey cake. And our waitress was absolutely adorable. I have nothing to complain about and will definitely be back to try more of the infused vodkas--ideally on my birthday so I get a Russian birthday song like some of the other tables!, Really pleased with this addition to downtown DC. Decor is ... interesting. I felt like I was in a well-to-do Russian babuskhas home. Old family photos everywhere, dainty side tables and upholstered chairs. Very unlike a lot of restaurants in DC. A pleasant change.Service was great, which was a relief. Our server was helpful in explaining the dishes, and the traditional dressing for the Russian country salad (sunflower oil). And the salad: very refreshing, perfectly dressed, and tasty. Only complaint however, which Im sure will be solved later in the summer, was the somewhat mealy tomatoes.Pickle dish was great. Cherry tomatoes bursting with acid. And tomato soup like my grandmother used to make. Unbelievably red, and very tasty. Bread came served with this fantastic sea salt and sunflower oil. I can say with all honesty Mari Vanna also serves the best mashed potatoes Ive had in DC. Absurdly good.Minus 1/2 star because they did not have any dumplings or pierogies. And minus another 1/2 star because while this place is really good, its also really expensive., Summary: food was a 4+, logistics/service was a 0, so overall rating comes to a 2.This past Mother day I went to the newly opened Mari Vanna - I had read the glowing reviews, and was looking forward to a great experience. When we first arrived, they seated our party on the 3rd floor, and then told us the buffet was on the 1st, where we would have to serve ourselves. Happy Mother Day! To make matters worse, they hadn dealt with a major crowd before, and were clearly trying to portion the buffet food (small plates only). However, there were large yet very shallow soup bowls. Right away I got soup, only for it to spill (even before the trek upstairs!) When our party brought up the logistic difficulties of walking up 2 flights of stairs with your soup and plates that can accommodate two radishes, the man running the kitchen informed us that large plates were for dinner only. He wasn too pleasant about it either. No Borscht for you!The saving grace of this restaurant is that the food was tasty. Thin, tender, sweet (but not cloying) blini... pelmeni that actually taste like meat that they contain, and authentic tasting sour cabbage were the highlights, but really, just about everything on the culinary side of the house was excellent. Too bad the experience was ruined by management incompetence (the servers were apologetic, and tried to accommodate us with what they could). End verdict: don come here for brunch., Over-priced and mediocre food and drinks. Fries were dripping in fat, blinis were small (three strips of salmon for $16?) and oysters were strangely tasteless. Cocktails (which we didnt try) are Gibson-priced at $14. I dont mind paying for quality, but this isnt it. Which is a shame - the area could do with a quality addition., I was there tree times with surprisingly different results. Great idea, but management needs a lot of training and effort.Positives: - Brilliantly authentic, creative and fun decor, especially on the second floor; - Live music if you are lucky; - Relatively long menu with interesting mixture of Russian, Ukrainian and Georgian cuisines; - Wide selection of excellent infused vodkas, unusual Georgian wines.Negatives: - Quality of food is generally good, but not consistent: - VERY inconsistent and moody service: from highly professional, pleasant, and fast to infuriatingly slow (1 hour 20 minutes before the first course arrives) and sloppy (forgetting drinks, bringing one dish at a time, so that one is looking at the cooling plate while others are still waiting and waiting.)Overall impression:Interesting, can be great fun, definitely worth at least trying.Request second floor!Great for special events - they tend to assign the best people to the groups., I recently hosted my birthday at Mari Vanna, on the top floor. The decor and ambiance are unlike any other in the city, and are truly unique, sophisticated, but cozy all at once. My 40+ guests had ample room to have different experiences, yet intimacy all at once. Their music is always fantastic and exactly what you would expect in such a venue. Their staff was extremely accommodating and responsive in setting up my event, particularly manager Yana. I will always come back here for a getaway from the rest., Wow. This is my new favorite restaurant. Well my rich me favorite new restaurant. I came here for dinner with a friend, and it was a great time.The day was beautiful, and they have outdoor seating. But we opted for a table inside by the window which was perfect for people watching.The decor is absolutely beautiful. It reminds me of the boho restaurants I had encountered in Prague a few years back. I think Mari Vanna means grandma so the decor looks like your Russian grandmother house. Well your boho chic grandma house. Think Anthropologie or Free People decor -- I happen to love that kind of shit. Anyway, decor aside.. our whole experience was great.The Russian wines we had were amazing, just as described and just as we wanted. It was a beautiful summer evening so I opted for a white wine which the waitress described as a cross between sauvignon blanc and chardonnay. It was perfect.The place also infuses their own line of vodkas.... so when in Russia, you do as they do and have a few shots. I got the horseradish vodka shots, and they were soooo good. Well it was like a punch in the face grow hair on your chest kind of vodka, but it was good. My friend got strawberry vodka shots, and she seemed to like them. The horseradish vodka was their only non-fruit vodka, and I chose it because my body + sugar + liquor = no bueno. (Oh and if you check in on facebook, they give you a free shot. You just have to show your waiter, and no you can check in 3 times and get 3 free shots. Boo. But multiple people in a party can check in and each gets a free shot. Brilliant marketing, Mari Vanna.)The food was really tasty. It a foodie kinda place, with an extensive menu. We ordered dumplings, Cornish hen (actually called Chicken Tabaka and it apparently a Georgian specialty), and crepes for dessert. The garnishes taste homemade, from the sour cream that came with the dumplings to the mayonnaise (it was more of an aioli) that came with the Cornish hen to the jams/jellies that came with the crepes. The chicken was moist and tender and flavorful, and understand that I don normally like chicken. The dumplings were yummy as well. They were stuffed with pork and beef sausage and maybe garnished with dill, so it tasted both rich and bright at the same time (if that makes any sense). The crepes were great too, and if I weren so full, I would have ordered another kind. The dessert menu has a large selection of stuff I have not encountered anywhere before, and I would have liked to try them. I would have also liked to try their salads; they looked good. During the dinner, an old dude with an accordion was playing music, and everyone got into it and was clapping and almost dancing along. The place was very lively - but not so loud that you can hear people talk.The service was phenomenal - it was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable. Everyone was Russian looking and the girl waitresses had on these really cute flowered old school dresses and they looked so cute. Our waitress recommendations were very helpful (this was my favorite growing up or My grandmother made this for me every Sunday or Get this if you are really hungry.)I hate restaurants where the server doesn know what the food tastes like, and that not the case here. Service was very attentive but not annoying. We never had to hunt down anyone for water or whatever. The check came with Russian candy. Oh and when the manager noticed that our purses were plopped on the floor, he brought out a really cute little footstool for them. The people watching was hilarious. One way I can tell an ethnic place is serving decent food is the number of compatriots that frequent it. We saw soo many Russian looking people come by. You know - blondes with big boobs in really tight dresses and sky high heels and mean looking Russian dudes with really big muscles and tight shirts. The third floor apparently has a lounge that opens at 10pm; I never got to go, but I will check it out. Russians know how to party, so it probably a good debaucherous time.It was expensive, but I felt that it was money well spent. And I will definitely come back when I feeling rich again., If you want to take a quick trip to Russia head to Mari Vanna.I went here with a group of friends- including a few Russians - and we all left very impressed and perhaps a little buzzed from too much vodka. The staff was very fun and made some excellent recommendations. During dinner someone will periodically come out and play traditional Russian songs on the accordian. Everyone eating dinner gets into the music, dancing and clapping along. The place had very interesting decorations and it seemed very authentic. My Russian friends said the food tasted like it did back home and it was a very similar vibe to the places they would eat. The vodka was (too) good. There was a horseradish vodka that was far too easy to drink. Great time and I am looking forward to my next visit!, I went to Mari Vanna with some coworkers who are from the former Soviet Union. It was extremely helpful to have them there to explain the menu. We sat upstairs at the balcony rail. The first thing you notice is the amazingly awesome decor. I do not know who they paid to decorate their establishment but it was money very well spent.The waitress was Russian with only a slight accent and very helpful.I decided on the Pre Fix lunch menu for $19, which includes soup or salad and an entree. I opted for the soleniya, which are pickled vegetables. The pickles and cabbage were very good. I was not a big fan of the pickled cherry tomatoes. The taste was a bit acidic, similar to seltzer water, which I personally cannot stand. I like fresh raw tomatoes so the pickling was just way out of my cuisine comfort zone.I ordered the corvina fish for the entree. It is a white fish I have never had but it was very tasty and cooked to perfection. The tomatoe based vegetable sauce served with it was the perfect accompaniment.I also ordered the citrus lemonade. It is a hand made drink that I would not describe as a lemonade but more of a crushed juice drink. The drink alone was $7, which is way too expensive for what it was.Overall the food was excellent and out of the ordinary fare you are likely to find in the DC area. The service was good. The atmosphere was AMAZING! The prices were too high but this must be because they are still paying off the decorator. I will definitely go back to Mari Vanna as it is a very unique restaurant with good food. But I will be sure to go on payday when my pockets are full., I felt like I stepped back in time in this restaurant - it is so charming and beautiful! The cute and home-y decor took my breath away and really enhanced my dining experience. I got to the table, and they had a sign inside a picture frame that said Waiting for Helen! My friends and I ordered the pirzhok appetizer, which was so good, although way too overpriced. We also ordered the blinis with red caviar, which tasted amazing. The blinis came with just sour cream and caviar, but it was great, and I felt that we didn need other ingredients anyway. I ordered the borscht and loved it. My friend salmon was also good, and so were my other friend potato dumplings. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake, birds milk, and honey cake. I loved the honey cake - it tasted kind of like a graham cracker. The chocolate cake balls were good but very rich. I wasn really a fan of my birds milk because of the consistency, which wasn fluffy like a souffle. The check came to us in a cute coin purse. I would definitely come back one day, but make sure you make reservations very far in advance!, Ok, but I probably wont recommend this place for food. Good fun atmosphere but food was very below average. I tried several items from the menu., Came by this Russian bar in DC on a friends recommendation as it was described to me as a restaurant/lounge and overall cool place to hang out. It was a long holiday weekend so it was kind of slow here, we went directly to the top floor as that is where the action is supposedly. Im not a huge fan when a place blasts out the music before the crowd arrives, it makes the place seem hollow. Cocktails were on the high side, around $14 a pop. Staff was friendly. The patrons were mostly an attractive group of people in their 20s and 30s. The place did seem cliquey, everyone seemed to be secluded amongst themselves. I would go back to give it another try at some point., Although Ive never eaten at a Czarist eatery -- and probably never will -- I imagine this is what it would look and feel like. The first thing you notice upon entering (well, aside from some eye-catching patrons) is the decor, which looks like it includes a fair amount of recently taken-out-of-loooong-term-storage-and-cleaned-off authentic bourgeois loot from the Bolshevik revolution (that would be 1917, for those who dont know much about history). Even the bathrooms have samovar faucets and Russian literature and are decked out in Russian newspapers. The televisions (which, really, should show in black and white only, for greater verisimilitude) play various Russian shows. The music is a mix of American and Russian songs -- as would be expected in a Russian restaurant.My friend and I did not try the food, so I cant speak to that, but the beer selection includes authentic from-behind-the-erstwhile-iron-curtain beverages (like Baltica). Similarly, there are various Russian candies in jars at the bar.Service was friendly. Prices are what youd expect in a Russian restaurant -- a little pricey, but within reason. Fun place., I went to Mari Vanna after walking by it several time. The decor is charming and cute- a great place for drinks or a date. The waitresses are Russian which adds to the authenticity and were friendly, describing and recommending dishes to our table.Ive never had Russian food before, so my group decided on the prix-fixe lunch for $19. I got the Borscht which was really good (then again, I have nothing to compare to). The waitress recommended Stroganoff which was great as well. I tried my friends dishes, all of which were delicious. One friend did decide to go for your most typical non-Russian food of plain green salad and a sandwich which looked bland, unappetizing and overpriced, so please dont order that kind of dish. Another friend had leftovers which was packed in a box and put in a magenta knitted bag! I wish I had leftovers just to get the bag.Id love to go back again for dinner and try their drinks as well, especially the Russian vodka flights. The dinner price is more expensive though., Walked by and saw the pre-fixe lunch advertised for $19. (Yes it was written pre-fixe on the sidewalk ad board and not prix fixe). The menu said the pre-fixe included soup or salad, and sandwich or entree. I was a party of one. At the end of the meal I was charged $19 for the pre-fixe, plus charged for the soup and entree on top of it. The total was $52!!!! What the hell is pre-fixe then? $19 cover charge for no music? It took forever to to get someone to answer my question about how to eat a certain dish (couldnt flag anyone down until I had eaten it all.) It took forever to flag someone down for the check, then take my payment and then process the card. The check was just dropped off so I couldnt ask anyone about it. I had to leave and was just ignored sitting the corner. I returned the next day to rectify the check, and the problem was corrected. They said they have a new system. Dont know how a wrong receipt was provided to me in the first place; the waitress knew what I ordered. Food was good and in good proportions. Atmosphere was that of a 19th century country house. Staff were mostly Russian. I had the beef borscht (cabbage and beet soup with a little beef - was good), chicken stroganoff (it was creamy), and the birds milk dessert (more of a vanilla mousee with chocolate layer - doesnt seem particularly Russian but was good and sized for two)., My favorite restaurant in DC!! This is one of the very few restaurants that I have found in DC that matches the quality of restaurants that I found when living in New York. The drinks are amazing as they have many different flavors of vodka. The restaurant is beautiful and cute all at the same time - it feels like youve stepped into your Russian grandmothers house. They also pay attention to detail - the last time I went they had a sign on my table in a cute picture frame which welcomed me in English and in Russian and it had my name printed on it. I also appreciate the fact that the restaurant has no issue with you sitting at a table with friends and ordering a bunch of drinks instead of food. (Ive had one too many experiences in DC where my friends and I were told that we had to order food if we wanted to sit at a table.) I also enjoyed how theres a guy that walks around the restaurant and plays accordion music. Ive seen him a couple of times so he seems to always be there. I recommend this restaurant to all my friends in DC!, NEVER EVER EAT HERE.Ie worked in the food industry, so I am quite flexible when it comes to service. I know what is to be expected, but I know when zero fucks are given. Our server was definitely overworked for a Thursday night. Perhaps they need to hire another, I don know. But I do know that I didn see the manager/owner doing a damn thing to help out. It was impossible to get drinks because the guys bringing out food couldn take a drink order. Fine. But they also couldn send out waitress over. I saw her when she took our food order and that was it. After dinner, we tried to close out. How hard to you think it would be to run TWO credit cards? It took 45 minutes for our server to run the damn cards only AFTER we flagged her down TWICE and got a manager. So there we sat, for 45 minutes waiting on someone (anyone!?!?!?!?) to close our check. On our way out the manager offered, Oh, I sorry -the machine was down. That where I got pissed. First of all, Ie worked in the industry long enough to know that youe a liar. Second of all, I saw bar patrons closing out with their card. Third of all, The second our waitress walked over to close out our check, it ran fine. She just didn try for 45 minutes. In short Mari Vanna, your service was shitty, you lied to your patrons, and you were indignant about it. NEVER AGAIN. Your existence will surely be short-lived in DC.Do svidaniya, comrades!, Ive hit this place up twice now, suggested it to friends, brought my two Russian friends here and thumbs are WAY up allllll around! Dude walking around playing accordion with a techno Euro-pop soundtrack on.....check. Attractive Eastern-block waitresses with a mix of calm and cool demeanor and friendly attentiveness....check. Great decor that bright, lofty yet snuggley and Euro-tastic....check. Vodka, vodka-infusions, vodka-cocktails and Borscht.......check! It can get very crowded, the bill can creep up quickly and I heard theres a magical key that lets you in for special occasions....who do I have to kill to get that key......check!!!, Mari Vanni is like the softer version of my Russian grandmother.My Baba was edgy, rocked platform heels, chunky amber jewelry, faux fur coats and huge sunglasses into her 70s. If Baba was vodka on the rocks, Mari Vanna is a lavender infusion. Light colors, delicate trimming and dainty accents make up the decor here. The space is intimate enough to get the lay of the land in one quick glimpse, but the upstairs balcony will lure you to want to explore more. Both times that Ive dropped by, its been for drinks. The first time (on a weekday) I was surprised to see the bar fill up so quickly once 5:30pm rolled around. While it may not be a rambunctious happy hour, its definitely buzzing. As for the drinks, they have a great selection of Russian beers here. I gave the Baltica a try on my first visit and loved it. (And Im not even a big beer drinker!)Their cocktail menu is also excellent. I wouldnt normally order sangria, but I was not a huge fan of the Sauvignon Blanc I ordered. I was just going to suck it up and deal with the drink envy I was experiencing as I looked around, but the bartender was astute enough to tell I wasnt feeling it. He was so nice and attentive, he said he could just take it and make some sangria for me, which was AMAZING and so refreshing with fresh watermelon. I might be slightly obsessed with it since Ive caught myself thinking about it on numerous occasions since!They also have a bunch of vodka infusions, so have lots of fun sampling them all.Overall, definitely a place Id recommend to just about everyone to grab a drink in a beautiful, laid back environment., This place is awful. Food is overpriced. My food came out luke warm and bland. They wouldnt run more than 3 cards for a 15 person table, but did not notify anyone of this. And they took forever just running those cards, come to find out 30 minutes later that their machine was malfunctioning. Thanks for letting us know. I have no problem with bad service if there are legitimate reasons behind it, but to keep our party uninformed and waiting is unacceptable. Stay away., Mari Vanna is an upscale restaurant that serves traditional, but delicious, Russian fare. I am a big fan of their house-infused vodkas; my favorite is the horseradish vodka martini. I also sampled their pear vodka, which was quite good. I should preface the food review by saying I am from Polish and Russian stock, so this kind of food is what I grew up on. Mari Vannas borscht is decent but not the best around (for best borscht in DC, go to Russia House up the street); the charcuterie plate, served with bread, garlic cloves, and green onion stalks, is very rich but tasty; the pierogies with butter and mushrooms are VERY good; the stroganoff is also very tasty and satisfying. Friends I dined with were very pleased with their dishes (rabbit stew and roasted chicken).Highly recommended but be aware itll cost you., Mari Vanna is an upscale restaurant that serves traditional Soviet-Russian food. It has all typical Russian dishes: stuffed crepes, chicken tabaka, olivier salad, and others.We went here on Thursday night and it was packed. However, we were seated immediately (we had a reservation though) -- so, that was a good thing. Service is a bit slow although our waiter was nice and attentive -- since we were not in hurry, we were absolutely fine with it.Drinks are awesome. I had strawberry sangria and it was soooo delicious. My husband had a kuznechik -- a some type of cucumber drink, very good too.Mimosa salad was done well: both taste and decoration.I loved my crepes with sour cream -- yum, recommend.For entree we ordered sea bass and chicken tabaka. Chicken tabaka was to die for -- recommend. Fish was good too but not as awesome as chicken.For dessert we tried medovik and Kievskiy. Kievskiy was good but medovik could be better -- for our taste it was a bit dry but if you have never tried this cake before, youd probably love it anyway. Our absolutely favorite part of the evening was live music: an accordionist plays for patrons two-three times during the dinner and, man, he is good! Overall, great experience. Will be back for sure., I was excited to introduce my American colleagues to Russian food. Ive been to Mari Vanna once before and the food was good (albeit overpriced) and waitress was friendly.Unfortunately, I was embarrassed to have suggested Mari Vanna for lunch. The food was really good, but the service was extremely slow. It took nearly 20-30 minutes to pay and leave. The Pelmeni Tuesday ad that they ran on their website did not apply to lunch - although there was no indication of that on the website.If youve never tried Russian cuisine, I recommend that you try Mari Vanna, even only if there are no better alternatives in the Wash DC area. The food here is actually good but the service is hit or miss. There are also no descriptions on the menu, so you will need someone to explain each dish to you. Good luck., Mari Vanni is number one exporter of Russian food all DuPont! It GREAT! With a menu keeping it real on the Russian food front, I wasn disappointed with the apparent authenticity of this relatively new DuPont establishment; however, I found lunch a bit dull and service spotty on a recent trip. Dinner has usually been on point with great Russian service and goodies, and a great Vodka selection (same as the only competition around, Russian House). What this place has that Russia House doesn is a kitschy atmosphere that does (as others have noted) make you feel like youe at grandma house. However, unlike Russian House, this place was never a hang-out for KGB agents during the cold war, so... keep that in mind. I recommend for dinner, but not for lunch as their set price menu is limited and can leave you wanting for selection. Happy hour and the desserts are always worth a look, but I skip it on Friday/Saturday nights unless youe looking to party with Caps players. As alluded to above, weekends this place turns itself into a disco/bar which is great except it still feels a little like Grandma house., We took some colleagues (one of whom recently emigrated from Russia) for lunch -- and were totally embarassed. Russian colleague indicated he had never heard of most of the food on the menu - did not know what many of the dishes were. Borscht was tepid, had very little beef or beets in it and was greasy. Bread was not served until we asked for it, and was stale. People who had them said vegetable juices and lemonades were tasty - but way overpriced. Service was the worst part - waitress took our order and disappeared; it took 45 minutes to get food; and took another 30 minutes to cash out. Dont go here for a business lunch if you need to get in and out quickly.
40|masseria-washington|As the first free standing restaurant outside the popular Union Market, Masseria welcomes you with a courtyard with high-timbered walls and relaxed outdoor seating which include flower planters and low-slung gray sofas. Walking in farther takes you to the pergola, a patio where tables and chairs gather on top of blue and white tiles and under strands of light bulbs and a retractable awning next to the indoor/outdoor bar. As the sun sets, soft lighting comes on and the space is transformed as you dine on the patio or smoke a cigar in the lounge area. I was reminded of Masseria having a cigar menu for outdoor diners to peruse and enjoy when I got a waft of cigars after leaving a three hour culinary experience under twilight. Masseria is a reference to charming country houses throughout the Italian region of Puglia and is also reflective of the neighborhood it calls home. A rustic, modern industrial chic atmosphere is an aesthetic I very much enjoy and find palatable with the cuisine being served here and is a theme evident throughout: distressed cement and wood, exposed brick, a Restoration Hardware looking chef dining table, pendant lighting, walls of wine bottles and boxes, and marbled counter seating facing the open kitchen area and bar.A gentleman greeted my friend and me and checked on us at least once during dinner. He opened the door to the restaurant where a hostess asked whether we had reservations and then asked if sitting at the open kitchen counter was ok. I was very much amenable to that as it was an opportunity for a much livelier view.Amy gave my friend and me a few minutes to decide whether we wanted to order anything besides water (we did not) before she took away the drink menu and present the dinner menu. The dinner menu is an ambitious one - a tasting menu only. During the soft opening, they had a 3 course ($62) or a 5 course option ($84) which was/is being offered at 50% off. You can build your own experience.They also offer free corkage during the soft opening, and I noticed a couple of girls taking advantage of this, pulling wine bottles out of their purses the second they sat down. Between the two of us, we were able to sample an eclectic range of dishes, some of which were complimentary, and listed in order of presentation:- complimentary burrata and heirloom tomatoes, sprinkled with freshly ground black pepper (delightful mix of salty and sweet)- complimentary tomato fondue, homemade pretzel rings with black fennel seeds, and focaccia bread (interesting tomato paste like consistency, pretzel flavors, and soft, herbful bread)- crudo and agnolotti (refreshing notes of lime on white fish, reminded me of ceviche; crunchy breadcrumbs mixed with pasta and hints of seafood flavor)- pasta sfoglia (open ravioli, generous portions of shrimp, beautiful thin slices of squash, delicious puree)- orata (crispy fish on one side, soft and tender on the other, interesting sauce, great taste of cooked cherry tomatoes)- anatra and vitello (crispy duck skin, tender duck meat; another great taste of cooked cherry tomatoes, leeks, and spring onions; tender veal, delicious chantrelles)- complimentary palate cleanser which was a saffron, cornflower sorbet with peaches (refreshing, cool sorbet)- oro cioccolato and fruitti di bosco (delightful mix of textures, flavor; soft, fluffy cake, cool, clean sorbet, tangy fruit) - complimentary cannoli and Italian flag cake (crunchy and oily shell covering cream; light fruit flavor (apricot was yellow, red was strawberry (I think), green, unsure) sandwiched between thin chocolate layers)Between calling several times and emailing, I finally got through to someone on the phone who placed my reservation on OpenTable (although if you were to look, OpenTable was only formally accepting reservations after the restaurant official August 4 opening). My other friend was here too and she ended up getting an email confirmation without speaking to someone about the same dinner reservation time.It took a little longer than I expected to place our orders. There are only two unisex restrooms. I saw waits throughout the evening as the restaurant slowly filled. It was easier to look for their neighbor, Solid Gold Inc., than it was to look for Masseria itself.6 seat chef table - $150 for 8 to 10 courses With more than 20 people working, no detail is left unnoticed. From complimentary items presented throughout dinner to staff making way in narrow passageways by the front door and bathroom, everyone was attentive. Glasses were promptly filled when water levels were below 80-90%. Napkins are folded and placed on the table when diners leave to use the restroom or step out for a breath of fresh air. We were checked on a couple of times. Dishes were served from our right and cleared from our left. Servers would wait for my friend and me to finish our sentences before introducing the dishes., Everything Veronique L. says in her review is true, but ... We arrived a few minutes early, and were told wee seating on time, which seemed an unnecessarily antagonistic way to greet people who were clearly eager to try an exciting new restaurant. Upon finally being seated, we received drink menus only. We waited 30 minutes for our drinks, or rather, drink; I had ordered iced tea, only to be told, rather haughtily, that we don serve iced tea. Our waiter finally took our meal orders 45 minutes after we sat down, providing only a perfunctory sorry for the delay. We received our first food 75 minutes after we sat down (yes, at this point I was timing things), while our main course arrived 2 1/2 hours after we were seated. I guess I just too much of an American; I really not used to spending 3 hours on a meal. The use of concrete in the dining room is an interesting design choice, but it means that the room is very loud, and after 3 hours, I was almost numb. The food was very good, but, frankly, not exceptional. The fois gras with figs was a great starter, probably my favorite part of the whole meal. Linguini had some bite, but the sauce was undistinguished. The dorado was excellent, both crispy and tender, with a wonderful sauce. The dry-aged duck was good, but rather bland. Overall, my wife and I agreed that the dishes were a bit too rich, and that a little less butter and olive oil would have allowed the flavors of the other ingredients to show through more. We attended during the soft opening, so that I can understand there were some kinks to be worked out. In the end, I suppose what made this such an off-putting experience was the general attitude of condescension from the staff -- you are so lucky wee allowing you to eat here, and youl wait until wee ready to serve you. Masseria shows promise, and the chef is clearly talented, but this meal at least was not a pleasant experience. On food alone, I would rate Masseria at four stars, with the potential for five, but the service was so unapologetically dismissive that, for this visit at least, Ie rated it at two stars only. Because the restaurant does have such potential, I really hope they are able to bring the service (and the attitude) in line with the quality of the food., Masseria brings a whole new dining experience to DC. The location is straight out of the NYC meat packing district before it got cool. The Union Market area is exploding with new development, yet the strip of 4th Street where Masseria is located has yet to be touched. You drive warily through century-old warehouses until you spot a lit sign. You park anywhere (free!) as there are no street markings or no parking signs. The restaurant is an island of chic. You enter a private courtyard of nicely arranged outdoor lounges, where the fashionably hip drink cocktails and smoke cigars. You step under a roof where beautiful tables of reclaimed wood await. We dined on this patio, perfect on a sultry Washington evening, although ceiling fans would have been a welcome addition. We started with a lemony Gavi chosen from a thoughtful selections of Italian wines. You are offered a 3 or 5 course choice - portions are smaller for the 5 course dinner, which we chose as it forced fewer hard choices between delightfully described options on the pre fixe menu. The dishes were exquisitely prepared. The portions consists of small, delectable bites, artfully displayed. Crudo was a citrusy opener. Linguini was spot on perfect, topped with a surprising and delightful crunch from what seemed to be ground rice or something of the sort. Red snapper was fresh and tasty. The dry-aged duck was a nugget of goodness, wrapped within an enjoyable crusty layer of fat.The deserts were the mind-blowingly delicious cap to the meal. The choccialato plate featured an stunning arrangement of chocolate delights, each with distinctive flavor and mouthfeel. The berries and cake plate exploded with flavors.The service was... a little spotty. The host/waiter was excellent, professional, well informed and welcoming - 5+ stars. The main server for our table seemed more intent on fast delivery (once the food was ready) and rote recitation of ingredients than warmly hosting the table. There were rather long delays between the courses, and the servers were repeatedly confused about which diner had ordered what plate, and even whether they were at the right table. It was the last night of the restaurant soft opening, so you have expected the staff to have the system down and be a little more sure of themselves, which will earn Masseria that fifth star above. Theyl get there though - they all seemed very intent on delivering a spectacular experience - which they did., Just came here and its closed, even though the website says its open. No one is picking up the phone., Ambiance - 5 stars - The restaurant has a cool LA/Brooklyn feel and the outside patio with the indoor/outdoor bar is great for a cocktail or cigar.Food - 4 stars - There were 4 of us and 2 were vegetarian. If you are feeling hungry and have enough time, I recommend the 5 course tasting. Let me start backwards - the chocolate dessert was very good. The cheese plate was a highlight and I was a big fan of the apricot bread and try the HONEY! The pasta dishes were better than the meat entrees and the restaurant has nothing on Rose or some of the other new tasting menus. Il give them another shot after theye been open for a bit. Vegetarian dishes were a bit lacking and after a bit of a complaint about what was sauteed veggies they waiter brought an extra vegetarian pasta dish that improved our feeling about the restaurant.Drinks - 4.5 stars - Ie had drinks from at least 3 of the establishments that Julien has worked at. I was a bit disappointed with the drinks on the menu (but not the creative names). Julien made us a custom drink and it was much better than the others. The price of the drinks was a big plus - at $12 this was better than many similar restaurants like Rogue. Wine was also good and reasonably priced.Price - 3.5 stars - It better than many of the other tasting menus for what you get, but it still not cheap - especially for the area. The grand opening wasn busy at all.Service - 5 stars - Wait staff was excellent and I enjoyed speaking a touch of Italian with some of the staff.Good for a cocktail and stay for dinner. You won be disappointed, but you will not be blown away., I had an incredible experience at Masseria. The five course meal was awesome. I would highly recommend anyone to experience what Masseria has to offer., This restaurant substantially exceeded my expectations and is definitely the best meal I have had in D.C. to date. I dined alone yesterday evening and the restaurant could not have been more friendly or accommodating. When the Washingtonian republishes its top 100 restaurants, I suspect and sincerely hope this place enters the list near the top. Ultimately, the only deficiencies are a few minor kinks that I suspect will be worked out with time.As I entered the restaurant, the hostess was not immediately available to seat me, but one or two members of the staff immediately located her and I was seated overlooking the kitchen, with a nice amount of space between me and an elderly couple to my left. The view of the kitchen made the usual aspect of solo dining a lot less awkward and for that I applaud them. As for the menu, they have a 3 and a 5 course prix fix option, but I ultimately did 4 courses with the wine pairing. The meal began! First, they brought to the table the most lovely wooden box of foccacia, along with these little crackers that were cylinders and on a really neat piece of china. It came with a tomato fondue and I cannot even begin to explain how awesome these were. I wish the tomato fondue was involved, but some butter or extra olive oil as well.Then, an amuse bouche involving heirloom tomatoes, homemade burrata and basil. This speaks for itself, I could have had 10 of them!At this point, I stood up to use the restroom, only to find that the doors to the bathrooms in the back simply dont lock making for some awkwardness. This is one of those kinks! I came back to a perfectly folded napkin and seconds letter a glass of wine was brought to me. A sicilian red that made me crave the sun and the sea. The sommelier was knowledgeable, albeit not the most approachable. The first course came seconds letter - the most enjoyable tortellini stuffed with duck and with grilled peaches and parmesan on the side. My only complaint is I wanted more. I think the addition of some peach inside the tortellini would go a long way, possibly reducing the number of peaches on the plate in favor of an additional tortellini or two.The next wine emerged - it wasnt oaked and was relatively acidic, providing a degree of balance for the next dish, soft shell crab. Herein lies another kink, too much salt! Whoever was manning this station was being too liberal with their fingers. The summer corn pudding was to die for and the crab itself was nice, although I wish some of the less desirable pieces of the crab where removed prior to it being served. Then, the main course. A lamb course, perfectly cooked, seasoned and flavored. The onion was a bit awkward and the pistachio could have used a more prominent place. The roast garlic on the side was disjointed relative to the overall story of the dish. This was paired with a Cabernet from the North of Italy, close, relatively-speaking to Serbia. The size of the glass was immense and this definitely put most Napa cabs to shame.I then ordered dessert and a cocktail. These two items felt like they came from a restaurant that had done something perfect. The rest of the meal had the tools to be a Jean Georges or similar establishment, but failed to execute fully, but the dessert and drink could have come from any of the worlds top restaurants. The dessert had several different flavors, each better than the next. The plate was beautifully constructed and the hazelnuts, ohh the hazelnuts. The cocktail involved scotch, chocolate bitters a cherry. It had all the flavor, a marginal amount of sweetness, but did not rely on sweet as a crutch. If this bartender opened an independent cocktail bar, I suspect it would be exceedingly profitable. This portion of the experience: five stars.Finally, cannolis, lovely cannolis. The rest of the meal was, not considering price, also five stars, but as a relative matter four. So, as a final matter this is a 4.5 star restaurant. I hope this place takes off because it deserves all the compliments it can receives, so five star rating here you go! Cheers., I went there for dinner last week. The ambiance was great, the decor was modern and hip, the staff friendly and professional. The menu however was a disappointment. It is not a cheap place which is fine as long as I feel like I am getting my $$$ worth. They have 2 options where you are made to pick a certain # of dishes and one has to be a desert, mandatory desert even though I never order desert. Anyway my friend and I opted for the 3 course meal ( 2 dishes and a mandatory desert). I got an appetizer and a main course, all portions were appetizer size. the food was not bad but not the best I have ever had. The portions were so small we were both still hungry after the 2 courses. Desert came and it was larger than the 2 main courses put together and really good so I filled up on it because I was still hungry, after which I felt sick from all the rich chocolate. Bottom line is dont go there if you are hungry unless you want to fill up on desert or pick up a pizza on the way home. Otherwise its a great place for ambiance., My husband and I went for dinner last night (Tuesday), and we had a great experience. Its definitely in a transitional neighborhood, but the ambience of the restaurant is wonderful. It feels like you are in a little oasis. We arrived about 15 minutes early and they immediately seated us, bringing us the wine and cocktail menus. We each ordered a cocktail; mine had a lemon sorbet with prosecco on top, yummy! It took a little while to get dinner menus; I think they thought we were waiting for a 3rd person despite only having a reservation for 2. Ordering was easy, you either pick the 3 or 5 course option; I chose the 5 and my husband did the 3 so we could have a total of 8 and share them all. As many have said, the amuse bouche and the bread is wonderful. The amuse bouche involves heirloom tomatoes, homemade burrata and basil. There is some kind of salt or spice that is just fantastic! The bread (focaccia) was amazing, and the tomato fondue was the perfect compliment. I didnt love the crackers they brought but my husband did. I also noticed that the bathroom doors didnt lock; a little weird for sure especially because they are not gender specific. Once the food started coming out, while it was wonderful, there seemed to be too long in between courses for our liking. It was a Tuesday night, not necessary a long weekend evening, and we were there from about 7:45 to 10:15...tough on a school/work night. But the food was great -- we tried the tartare, the sweetbreads, the tortellini stuffed with duck and grilled peaches, the soft shell crab, one of the fish courses, and the duck filet. The tartare lacked the truffle taste I was hoping for; it was good, but not amazing. The sweetbreads had a really interesting dill taste, and they were great. The tortellini was lovely, and the soft shell crab was nice; the summer corn pudding wonderful, but I didnt love all the legs on the crab. The fish (3rd on the menu but I cant remember the name) was lovely and the brown butter sauce was amazing. I loved the duck but my husband felt it was a little tougher than expected. Then came dessert; my husband ordered the chocolate and I got the cheese mouse with blackberry sorbet. The chocolate dessert was by far the best, but the blackberry sorbet went nice with the chocolate. After we thought we were done, they came out with complimentary cannolis and house made 7 layer cake. Yummy!Overall, a wonderful meal, pricey but you get when you pay for. I just think the staff could do a better job paying attention to the individual clientele to determine the pace of the courses. Toward the end of dinner, I think it became obvious that we were a little antsy to get home., Great looking atmosphere. Terrible music- playing hip hop the whole time which does not align with the place at all. Beautiful platings and beet salad was good. Way too expensive and terrible service. Food is mediocre. They over charged us for items we did not order and would not make good on it. Will probably not go back unfortunately. Too bad- had a lot of potential., We were so excited to try this new restaurant and were delighted by the atmosphere upon arrival, but the service experience was one of the worst I have ever encountered. When our bill arrived at the end of the evening, we were charged for an $85 bottle of wine we did not order, a beer we did not order, and four $10 surcharges for those of us who ordered a savory dish for our 5th course instead of a dessert. Our server did not explain this surcharge but rather told us that a highlight of the menu is that you can order any five dishes in any order. Upon flagging these issues, the server courteously apologized for not properly explaining the menu and told us she would take care of all three errors. Ten minutes later, the restaurant manager returns, owns up to the extra wine charge, but then proceeds to imply that we are lying about the other two charges and says he is unwilling to refund them. Seriously? He was weirdly, passive-aggressive and rude -- and absolutely stalwart in his refusal to make right on the situation. Why he would choose to fight with us over $50 is beyond me.The restaurant is in soft-opening, so mistakes are absolutely acceptable and servers are still learning how to properly explain the menu, but not owning up to the mistakes, charging customers for items they did not order, and being passive-aggressive to customers is wholly unacceptable. FOOD: Some dishes were exceptional, others were average. ATMOSPHERE: Overall a very cool LA vibe, but the up-lighting was too bright Need to dim it down. Also music went from lovely lounge music to 90s rap/hip-hop midway through dinner, which felt out of place for the setting. If youre looking for a hip new dining experience in DC, there are plenty of other great spots on H Street (Maketto, Ocopa) that serve great food without the attitude., Ive had the pleasure of dining here twice and look forward to going back. Chef Stefanelli has created a very special place unlike anything else in DC. An excellent wine list compliments the five star cuisine. This is an absolute must for anyone who enjoys fine dining in a beautiful atmosphere.I have read a few reviews here that are not only inaccurate, but also reflect the quality of the diners more than the restaurant. Ignore them. This is a tasting menu, and some amateur diners do not understand the concept. These reviewers do not belong in this level of restaurant.On the other hand, those of us who understand and appreciate excellent food, and superb service, truly appreciate this gem of a find. I have had the five course tasting menu twice, with wine pairings, and both times the service and experience were amazing. A very professional staff, terrific GM and hostess, and excellent bartenders compliment a well trained and attentive serving crew. Do not miss this restaurant, and go now, because by the fall I suspect a reservation here will be hard to come by., Overall: uneven experience with a lot of potential. Until they get their sh*% together, I would only come back here for a drink/cigar in the patio or a drink and dessert at the bar.food/drank: 4 with potential for 5 -- all the first courses i had were great, especially the tripe w/lobster. who knew i could like tripe? still dreaming of the foie gras on hazlenut cream. sweetbreads were cooked nicely although theye not my thing. entrees: linguine with XO sauce was inedibly salty -- i had to send it back for something else. my replacement agnolotti w/quail egg and pancetta was superb. softshell crab was very salty on some sections and fine on others, but i felt bad sending another dish back, plus the creamed corn that came with it was divine, so i kept the dish. tried the lamb, duck, and veal -- and all were fine but nothing special. the chantrelles with the veal were decidedly un-tasty. something on top of the bone marrow or the salsa verde (v different from what most people refer to as salsa verde...fyi) was weirdly chalky/gritty. coffee grounds? cacao? it had no flavor and a bad texture.desserts: are BOMB, especially the oro cioccolato. frutti di bosco was also great. no one does desserts in dc like fiola/fiola mare but masseria may beat them at their own game.drinks are fantastic. the lemon sorbetto that comes in the prosecco cocktail is outstanding but i feel like the prosecco itself is undeserving of being paired with it. the passionfruit cocktail is also amazing.service: 3.5 -- a whole star goes to the hostess, whose fantastic attitude and propensity to HELP were surprising, to our delight. we showed up for drinks on a Friday as all tables were booked, but she kept her eye on the bar and let us know when a small group was about to leave so we could snag their seats. it was extremely busy so we very much appreciated her constant attention and positive attitude. my cocktail waiter from the patio took 35min to bring my first drink but he comped it. i imagine he forgot that one, but the bar was also very slow that night. i forgive them since it was soft opening. once we got to dine, our plate servers would bring the next course without taking our old plates off. there was definitely some tension between the bartender and the servers. i appreciate a good amuse bouche but it awkward to be told, this is to buy the kitchen some time. and indeed time was needed -- our 5-course meal took three hours.ambiance: 4.5 -- i foresee a zillion instagrams of the tiling of the covered portion of the patio. very cute interior. music is whatever. *i* personally liked the song choices but i kind of tired of white dudes pretending to be down by playing 90s hip hop and r&b.. let not pretend this isn a very upscale establishment with middle-aged/old rich white dude clientele. the rest of us can typically afford $100 smallbites.Suggestions: -patrons should be allowed to choose a non-dessert for their last course if they so choose. I thought their desserts were the stars of the dinner but a lot of folks don eat dessert-a small snack menu for the patio to accompany drinks-turn the music down a bit. keep the hip hop on the patio or late-night only., This restaurant is fabulous! Weve been twice. The first time we dined under the stars on the patio and the 2nd time at the bar overlooking the kitchen. Weve had both the meat dishes as well as the seafood. Weve opted for the 3 course savory menus which means you can forego dessert for a $10 surcharge. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. After dinner last night we asked if we could have a drink in the outdoor patio and the server was more than accommodating, and kept popping out to check on us even though she was serving the inside. Our servers Holly and Ann know their stuff. The vibe is very LA and on Saturdays the ladies are chicly dressed. (Guys, do your part). And Guiseppe is a wonderful host. We will be back!, Ive been to Masseria twice and both visits were exceptional. Delicious food, great service and I appreciate the thoughtfulness that went into creating a really beautiful, authentic space. Well done and will be back., Had a phenomenal dinner at Masseria last night, everything from the pre-dinner cocktail service in the courtyard to the final dessert tasting compliments of the chef! The Hennessy Jed and the Skiing in a Sombrero were the most imaginative and delectable cocktails Ive had in years! Would never believe that tripe would go with lobster, but their appetizer made me wrong! The linguini with the XO sauce was very tasty and unique while the veal was very rich. Looking forward to another visit soon, even just for the cocktails!, This was the best meal we have had in months, and I would compare the quality to Rose Luxury and Crane & Turtle. It was the perfect venue for a special date night. My husband and I both went for the 5 course option, and as a small eater I just picked carefully to keep each course light. I had the seafood crudo (the portion was quite generous - incredibly fresh with a unique citrus flavor from the pickled watermelon rind), the summer vegetable salad (the most beautiful and delicious salad I have ever had - literally ever), veal ragu pasta (the real deal - - - not many places in DC get this right), and the seafood entr39e (perfectly crispy skin on top - yum). I can say enough good things about the food, atmosphere and service. We sat at the counter to watch the open kitchen - very fun to do that. What I appreciated most was that, while we spent $200 on the meal with wine, it was an evening of food theatre that would have cost us twice this much to try to create at home (not possible). Inventive, creative, and delicious. Bravo!, The food is great! Small portions make the 3-course sampler the best option. I had the XO sauce linguini which is amazing! My wife had the octopus and I had the lamb, both were fantastic.Highly recommend for a date, great spot, will return., I loved dining at Masseria -- the food is absolutely delicious and the service amazing. Its a fresh new take on gourmet -- superb ingredients, artfully presented. I loved every single bite!!! And the cocktails are amazing -- so creative and yummy. The setting is hip and happening, yet comfortable, at the same time. Such a brilliant step forward for the DC food scene!!!, The atmosphere was exceptional. Tucked away in the Florida Avenue Market, it felt like you were sneaking off to a private getaway. The food was also amazing. Why? Because its chef driven and clearly cares about making outstanding food and providing excellent service. You can tell the chef and whoever designed the place put thought into every detail. We sat at the chefs bar which made the experience even better. It was like watching a play. If youre looking for thought provoking food thats more inspirational than most other restaurants in DC, with a great atmosphere (you can be relaxed and dress accordingly!) and a chef that clearly cares about your full experience - this is a place for you., Bottom line: food was executed perfectly in a beautiful location; however, service left a lot to be desired and dinner was over-priced.I dined here for a friends birthday. We arrived and the restaurant is truly beautiful. However, it was a slowish night and we stood at the hostess stand for server all minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Several staff walked past without even saying hello. For a high end restaurant I would never expect such a cold welcome. We were seated at a broken table (eventually remedied), but just one of those things that shouldnt be overlooked on a quiet night. Our server was very warm and friendly. To be honest, he seemed to be the only genuinely friendly staff member working. He walked us through the menu and I was irked because on the menu involved an up charge. Its not really price fix when you have to keep paying more. I felt very nickel and dimed.Food was excellent, executed perfectly. Although the plates were small.In the end, DC has too many great restaurants that cost less. I wont be returning., Made reservations at Masseria for 8pm for New Year eve. Never mind that when I called to make the reservation the person who answered the phone could barely hear me over the noise and incorrectly told me that there would be the regular menu on New Year eve. I called back a few days later to confirm there wasn a special menu, and come to find out there was a special menu for the later seating. Nonetheless, we were looking forward to our plans for New Year. I get a call on 12/30/15 to confirm our reservation for 6:30pm. When I made it clear that our reservation was for 8pm, there was nothing more than I sorry for the disappointment about the evening. The 6:30pm seating wouldn give you the opportunity to stay and ring in the new year there. Never mind that this mistake is completely unacceptable but the person on the phone did NOTHING to try and make this better. Ie read a lot of reviews about the customer service being poor at this restaurant, and this clearly proved it. A small gesture of customer service goes a long way, believe me. No graciousness or attempt to remedy the situation by saying, come in other time, wee so very sorry, come have a drink on us. For a place that trying to be such an upscale restaurant, their customer service leaves a lot to be desired. A restaurant is more than just good food. Sorry to see this place has no interest in being gracious to their patrons., Would give a 4 1/2 if I could! My family and I came to this restaurant as a pre-Christmas eve dinner! (Its a tradition for us) FIRST OF ALL, Finding our way INSIDE the restaurant was kind of confusing. We walked through the front outdoor patio area but couldnt find a door so we came back out and drove to try to find the other side. We failed. When we came back to try again, there were 2 other dinner parties confused on how to get in also. The door doesnt look like a door, but actually looks like a window... SooooOooOoo...Anyways, Everyone in my family (4/4) decided to go with the five course (there is an option between 3 & 5). We were able to choose from a long list of antipasti, entrees of pastas, meats, fish, and desserts! Be aware: everything sounds so good. I went with a mushroom appetizer, white clam appetizer, ravioli, a poached fish dish, and an apple based dessert! Everything was mostly really good!The pastas in general (I tasted others) were a little salty but really good in flavors. Ive never had fish cooked in the way that it was for my dish and it was interesting. The fish was very soft and almost gelatinous in texture. However, I think I prefer it cooked on a skillet with a crispy skin, but thats whats great about tasting menus!You get to taste a whole array of foods! Masseria is a great new restaurant that seems very hip (all the chefs were very young looking), and offers great flavor in their dishes! If you want to try a great up and coming restaurant in a unique location, this is the place for you!By the way, the desserts were to die for., Really 2 1/2 stars, but I wont round up and that should say something.We went to Masseria with family for a birthday dinner on a Tuesday evening, ill give them 5 stars for their Courtyard (think Southern California), the heaters were a nice touch and the music was on point...this is where the five stars end, though.As noted, this was a Tuesday night and not busy, the dining room was about half full but we experienced pretty poor service. The food was good, but not up to their prix fixe prices.Id highly recommend Masseria for a cocktail or two before dinner, or even starters (do they serve starters only?) if you can sit outside or under their covered dining area, but Id save the ~$500 or so that a dinner for four costs and spend it someplace else in DC, just wasnt worth it., We had an amazing experience with Julien at the bar. I dont know what its like to sit in the dining room and do the wine pairing but I can tell you that he was honest about what was the best on the menu and sincerely enthusiastic. He also urged us toward 4 courses rather than 3 as he felt it was a better value and we 100% agreed. Favorites included the lamb tartare and the squab (apparently Gordon Ramsay ordered two of them, so it has to be great). Ambiance is modern and sexy, cocktails were 100% incredible (Julien is arguably the best bartender in the district) and wine list interesting. We mixed it up with wine and cocktails and had a lovely experience overall, and felt it was a good value. Will return!, I had high hopes for Masseria, but I sadly have to say the food was a let down - I was disappointed more than I was wowed. I do have to say I loved the ambiance of the place. Also high marks to the sommelier, who was incredibly patient with us until we found a bottle of wine we loved! My husband and I both did the five course tasting menu ($85). Heres what we had:-The bread service is a nice tough. A+ for presentation, B on the bread itself.-Amuse bouche was some sort of fish croqueta - pretty good, salty.-Beet salad with grapes, walnuts and anchovy: skip it. I love beets, but the beets were bitter.-Burrata- standard burrata, creamy, good flavor. -Lamb tortellini: generous enough portion, but the flavor of the pasta and sauce was just average.-Foie Gras with pistachio and persimmon (+$10): generous portion of foie gras. I absolutely loved the plating - amazing flavors. The foie gras itself was a bit too oily for me, but you might like this.-Pennoni with spinach, pine nuts, raisins and pecorino: beautiful presentation, pasta was sadly bland. Tasted like it came out of a box.-Agnolotti with coffee and fennel sausage: this was one of my favorite dishes - fresh pasta, sauce nails it.-Lamb loin, lamb belly, garlic and spinach: this was so disappointing. The lamb was so tough I could barely cut it, let alone eat it. I always finish my meat dishes, but not this one. -Corvina with brussels sprouts and brown butter sauce: we really liked this one. the fish was tender and the brown butter sauce was to die for.-Beet gelato with oranges and some kind of bread crouton like things - I liked the beet gelato - like I said I liked beets. But overall this dish was pretty weird.-Flourless chocolate cake with tiramisu gelato, chocolate foil and some sort of toffee pop rocks - this was amazing. There were a few standouts, but as you can see most of the dishes were just okay and some were disappointing. Also, dont get excited about the text about the truffle and game menu you must try - its not actually available. I like that they let you pick and choose from any of the courses, but I do wish that dessert didnt have to be one of them - I would have preferred one dessert between us. Also, when deciding how many dishes to order, keep in mind that youll get bread service, an amuse bouche, a sorbet palette cleanser and a mini cannoli bonus dessert. Overall, while the space is beautiful and the food was beautifully presented, the quality of the food just wasnt up to par., Love this unusually high class spot located next to the food warehouses of Union Market. Its easy to miss but plan on a visit (no open table). The deal is you sign up for either a 3, 4 or 5 course meal. Price obviously higher the more items you get. And be ready because the 5 course option is a lot of food. Cod balls as a starter, fresh but slightly salty. The rabbit Ragu may be the very best item on the whole menu. Tasty and fresh and not overwhelming. Main entree of skate is delicate and accompanied by a wine sauce. The desert at the end is worth it. Try the beer gelato., Beautiful concept but it misses the mark in several ways. Kudos to the owners for opening this up in a barren sketchy area- a place this gorgeous and unusual is sure to attract other businesses and hopefully spark some revitalization in the neighborhood.We were happy to be seated quickly despite not having a reservation (came in on a Tues night around 8:30)Firstly design- the courtyard is gorgeous and the overall aesthetic of the place is nice. But there were just too many textures- white/grey marble bars, shiny aqua tile wall, stucco wall, one stone, wood walls in the courtyard, stainless steel thing above the kitchen, an oriental carpet, plus fluorescent tube lights. Whoah, it was too much. What is the common design thread here? Being a New Yorker I was surprised at how underdressed and unattractive the patrons were. But thats not the restaurants fault, thats just DC for you.I liked the open kitchen concept and enjoyed watching the chefs prepare the food. The food was tasty but not amazing. Burrata was nice but theres no need for oysters on it. The two just dont go together. Loved that the bread came in a wooden box, but it wasnt good bread- tasteless and the tomato paste that came with it did nothing for me. The funghi plate was very good. Corvina fish was nothing to write home about, and the squab was overcooked and a bit dry. It came with very rubbery bland parsnips filled with parsnip sauce, but it needed something tangy or sour to bring it to life. Overall the menu could do with some fresh greens.Exceptional service by the waiters who were very attentive and knowledgeable about the place, food and wines. The sommelier was very good and I loved the wines he paired with each course, especially the Masseria Verdeca. But the bartender was kind of a jerk to my friend! He ordered a cocktail but asked for a different liquor in it. The bartender spent like five minutes telling him how expensive the liquor was and that he wasnt sure how it would turn out because hes never mixed with such an expensive liquor. The price wasnt of concern to us and were in the middle of a conversation, but the bartender kept going on and on about how expensive it was, and was he REALLY sure he wanted that one? Absolutely positive? It was totally over the top and I was so irritated, especially when he told us it was $30. Ok, Id understand his concern if it was like $100 but really? In any other setting Id call it flat out racism- that a brown guy cant afford a $30 drink? But the bartender looked like a progressive little hipster: mustache, pocket square, bow tie and all, so Im hoping something else was going on.All in all Im glad I went, but I was underwhelmed., Fantastic, fabulous food and scene here at Masseria. Best know your food when you come because these guys sure do. Very elegant dining in the coolest dining room in DC designed by the stylish chef and world famous kitchen designer. Food is off the hook! Carefully thought out appetizers and wonderful pastas both home made and Gerardo DiNola dried pastas from Gragnano, Italy. Dishes are carefully orchestrated to perfection, they look and taste fabulous!Dining here is for diner not amateurs, if you want to cut your teeth in fine dining circles this is the place to do it. The staff is awesome, nice, friendly and accommodating. This can be your best dining experience in DC., Dined there last night with old friends and the tasting menu was really creative and impressive. I think the pricing is reasonable for what you get. Everything was presented creatively and the food preparation keeps on surprising us with pleasant contrasts and balance. Do try this place out if you are up for something out of the ordinary. I will come back!, We went here to celebrate birthday for my wife and once they knew, they made her feel special with extra treats. The waiting staff really knows the menu and the service is really good. The layout is pretty nice with an enclosed patio area for groups and cocktails, the interior is a pretty open and quaint layout for dining in smaller groups. The kitchen is completely exposed to the diners and we chose to site at the back facing the kitchen. The kitchen staff is very quiet during this whole process and it was a very neat experience. We needed a gluten-free dining experience and they had many options for us. The only negative was their gluten-free linguine pasta was too thick. Many people have tried and failed to make a good GF pasta. All of the food was very good and a great experience for us. Their website says dress attire Casual Elegant, no sports attire and sneakers. But the staff is wearing jeans and grey Converses. So it trendy., I looooved the venue...London meets Manhattan. Presentation was excellent as well. I also appreciated the variety of food to select from. All that said, here are some major flaws that makes it disappointing for a $300 meal:- they had nowhere to put our coats because they ran out of space -the front room was freezing - we were seated by the doors and both my feet and my food suffered-the waiter seemed annoyed with my questions -the food was good. Thats all. Nothing amazing, nothing bad. Good food beautifully presentedWe happened to be in the great company of good friends so it was a lovely evening overall but theres room for improvement., Beautiful restaurant, beautiful presentation, and a few beautiful tastes make Masseria a pretty special place to spend an evening. The design of the place stands out to you first, especially since its planted in the middle of a shady looking industrial complex. Worn brick building, wood and concrete courtyard, colorful encaustic tile floors - its got a really cool vibe that you just want to be around. Youre basically stepping into the trendiest condo youve ever seen. And the indoor/outdoor aspect works well even on a cold February night. I was a little worried about taking my wife to the area, but I found it perfectly safe with plenty of parking right in front.And what a great time we had. To start, our server was attentive and extremely knowledgeable about the menu, and the table staff (food runners and busboys) was as efficient and professional as they come. Its a tasting menu, so my wife and I each had a three course meal. I probably should have had a cocktail or two, since the beer menu was short and pricey. But I was happy with my Italian blond ale selection and even happier when the bread and tomato paste they gave us was legitimately delicious. Whatever savory combo of flavors it was, I could eat a whole meal of just that paste and the bread.The food was as pretty as food gets - clearly, they care about presentation. It was filled with flavor pairings I had never had before and made for a really unique, tasty experience. We started with the cheese plate (very solid, with a sweet coffee/fruit pairing) and Veal Tartare (tasty and umami like, a little too much salt) for our first course. Second course was rockfish I think (perfectly cooked, crispy skin, again a little too much salt) and Venison. Ive had plenty of Venison, and this was the best Ive ever had. Tender, flavorful, and the plum sauce was perfect. Italian desserts are usually more miss than hit for me, but I really enjoyed the last course. One was fruit focused with beignets and pistachio gelato, the other was chocolate focused with flourless chocolate cake and coffee gelato. Both were tasty, and I was full enough by the end to be glad we only ordered the three course meal. The check came with a couple of small cannolis, tiny and classic, making me a happy camper. What was there to nitpick? Well, one of the cheeses was parmesan, and I wanted something more unusual. The beer selection is small and pricey. A few dishes were perfectly salted, but a couple were over salted. And I think a fourth dessert option would be nice to have. But these are pretty small issues - the meal was great, the night was great - it should definitely be on your list of restaurants to visit in DC., A few friends and I went to my Masseria for dinner, and overall, its my new favorite restaurant in DC - great vibe, great drinks, and very good food.The atmosphere is very intimate and classy, but its still a great place for groups. They have a large two-sided bar where you can have a drink while you wait for your table if youre early. I would recommend that, because their drink program is very impressive. The standout drink for me was the vodka and blood orange sorbet cocktail. It was kind of an odd drink presented in a champagne coupe with a scoop of sorbet with Prosecco, but the flavor is so concentrated and then they dissipate in the process -- it was a very good drink.I really like how they have the prix-fixe menu set up. You determine how many courses you want (one has to be dessert) but the rest can be anything you want - if you want the three meat dishes, you would be missing out, but you would get some good food. Because we were four people and opted for the five course menu, we were able to try 16 of the 20 dishes. A quick highlight reel of our favorites include the roasted mushrooms, agnolotti with chestnuts, tripe with lobster, and the beautiful foie gras. Really, all the dishes were good, and thats impressive to do after 20 dishes. There was a lot of creative use of ingredients, and they were all very well executed.The open kitchen was a treat to see. We were seated in the back near the kitchen, and I enjoyed looking at all the chefs scurrying about. The service was very comprehensive and knowledgeable, and they knew the dishes inside and out.Overall, I really liked Masseria. But be forewarned, even without the wine pairing in just two cocktails, it was about $125-$150 a person., Excellent, of course. Best Italian in DC? No, but DC options are really limited on this front. So it is just as good as the other top Italian spots in DC. Cocktails are amazing. So definitely start with one. Wine list is decent although not mind blowing. Service of course also excellent. This is not an everyday restaurant - be prepared to drop over $200 per person (on the lower side)., I will give this an A for the vibe, location and decor. Would make an amazing summer hangout. I give it a D for food. The money they charge for pre fix does not come close to being justified by the amount of food they give. I had their fish stew as my main course and no lie this consisted of two pieces of shrimp and one 2 inch chunk of fish. Maybe a mini shrimp cocktail but nothing special and not a main course by any stretch. Two glasses of wine later and two pre fix dinners later we spent $300. Restaurants in DC are getting a little too greedy. Bring back normal portions and normal food., I had high hopes for this place and it hit the mark on some points. However, this place really needs to learn how to make a dirty vodka martini-mine was bad so I decided to go with a plain vodka soda towards the end of the meal. Cant complain about the drink itself (hard to screw up that one) but charging $16 for a vodka soda??? Really? I understand that a restaurant needs to make money but after paying over 300 dollars for a dinner for 2, paying 16 bucks for a vodka soda drink? Thats just outrageous. My other pet peeve was that a manager or anyone else for that matter never came up to see how we were enjoying our meal. Our waitress was nice but didnt speak English very well so we couldnt understand half of what she said and we had some questions about the menu. Overall, it was quite a miss for me., I had amazing expectations for this place after my fiancee told me he was taking me for Valentines, however, I almost died while eating here (true story). First: Restaurant is gorgeous. Very modern. Heating not the best because the walls and part of the ceiling is zinc and the front part of the restaurant is freezing cold. Second; Cocktails are really good. Would come back just for these.THIRD AND WHAT RUINED MY NIGHT: They are not on Open Table so we made reservations through their system. I am deadly allergic to shellfish (I carry and epi pen with me at all times) and although we usually put a note on reservations this time he made them by email/phone. They have a fixed menu and I ordered the Crudo, the Linguine and Striped Sea Bass. The Linguine was described as XO Spicy Sauce and had some other ingredients; NO SHELLFISH IN THE DESCRIPTION. After the pasta came, I was about to put it in my mouth and my throat and neck started to feel itchy so I asked my partner to smell the plate for me, turned out their spicy sauce had shellfish and we confirmed with the waiter who replied yes, and I didn read anything in the notes that said you had a shellfish allergy. That was it. No apologies, no we can get you something else, just its your problem. I know it my allergy but I have been to hundreds of restaurants, including Michelin Star restaurants and best practices include asking guests for any allergies while making reservations or in the restaurant. Also includes DISCLOSING when sauces have shellfish or peanuts since there are people out there that can die from eating them. But that was not even the issue, he did not apologize even out of courtesy, basically blamed us, and did not offer to REPLACE my dish. So I ended up skipping and ENTIRE course because I did not like what my Fiance ordered. OKAY ITS MY ALLERGY BUT I AM SPENDING $250+ for Valentines dinner and you cant offer to replace my course or say at least sorry and also blame me? Needless to say that after that scare and the waiter reaction, the rest of my meal was ruined. The bass was good. The wine list okay. The crudo, Ive had better (im talking about yours Joe). Will consider going back if they train their staff on how to be polite or start having better practices for patrons. YOU are a high end restaurant (your prices say so) so your practices and staff should be trained likewise. You almost had a guest go into cardiac arrest and didnt do anything to make them feel a little better. I did not feel good about having just two small courses and spending $150.00 for them and not to mention the possibility of something worse happening. #valentinesruined, Probably the coolest, elegant restaurant I have been to. Service and food were awesome. Definitely coming back. A hidden gem!, I was so excited to try this out for my birthday dinner and was very disappointed. First, the good: the cocktails were excellent and it was really fun to watch the bartenders at work. The space is beautiful, and I loved the courtyard and its firepits.We spent an hour after our reservation waiting for our spots at the chefs counter. There were at least six people behind us who had been waiting nearly as long as us who were just as frustrated. The hostesses, who were flippant when asked when they expected to seat us and were way underdressed for the venue (one was wearing a jersey and the other a crop top and converse sneakers. All of the servers were impecably dressed, as were the bartenders), did bring us two glasses of prosecco while we were waiting. It was a nice gesture at the time (about 20 minutes after we arrived), but didnt make up for the wait. At long last we were brought to a table squeezed in between two couples instead of the chefs counter we had reserved without an explanation or apology about the change in table. We were told we could wait more, but it would be at least a half an hour more. After an unsatisfactory conversation with the manager, we decided to leave instead of giving the restaurant more of our money.We were prepared to drop significant (for us!) money on dinner and drinks and were really, really disappointed in the service we received. We asked a few times about the status of our seats and were told the couple eating was just finishing up, that they had just dropped the check, and then again that they were approaching the end of the meal. It was clear they gave away our seats at the chefs counter to another couple who had been waiting.Ive never been to a restaurant with prix fixe menu (or really any restaurant) run so far behind. Im not sure what the point of a reservation system or a prix fixe menu is if the restaurant cant stay on schedule. It may have been an off night, but we would have been understanding if the hostesses or manager had given us an explanation. Instead, the hostesses seemed annoyed to interact with us and other patrons. We ended up at Maketto, which wasnt the meal we had wanted but was delicious and quick. The service there, as always, was fantastic and the everyone incredibly friendly. There are so many options in DC but everyone at Masseria behaved as if they were the only game in town., What a disappointing hospitality experience. My husband and I arrived at 6pm for a 6:30pm reservation and asked the hostess to sit at the bar until our reservation time. The hostess approached us within minutes of ordering a drink at the bar to seat us. We declined and reminded her that wed like to wait for our reservation time. Minutes later, a second hostess informed us that we would lose our table if we didnt sit immediately, almost 20 minutes before our reservation time. There was no explanation provided nor complimentary cocktail offered for our inconvenience. My husband and I were horrified at the lack of hospitality and further disappointed when we complained to the manager who did nothing to correct the situation. I had much higher expectations for a dining experience of this caliber. Will not return or recommend., Innovative twists on Italian cuisine. This is modern, small menu, small portion, creative cuisine that leaves you satisfied and wishing for just one more bite. Presentation, flavors, and aromas that are stimulating.Strong wine list, curated by great Somm. Perhaps could have a few more mid priced options. Quit a buzz but not as loud as some places. Friendly, attentive staff across the board. Open kitchen and chef controlling everything. Location reminiscent of Manhattan meatpacking district. Plenty of free parking., I usually dont write reviews as I never really have the time to nor had the urge to.In the case of this restaurant I would like to make an exception as our experiences were just not up to par.We dine in various fine dining restaurants throughout the world and know our fair share on palate etc.First of all I must say the place looks amazing, beautiful outside garden and nice open kitchen.We usually enjoy the hectic in the kitchen and so we booked a kitchen table. When we got there however we were placed on a regular table and nothing was noted to us. When we mentioned that we booked a kitchen table they looked around and had to discuss it with a manager as there were no seats left at the kitchen. We patiently waited and no one came back to us with information on what the plan was. This took long and after they moved someone from the table we were able to be seated. No apology for the wait nor for the mistake made however.We decided to enjoy the 4 course menu. The food was very plain, nothing special. Appetizers (tartar and sweetbreads) were normal and not anything to write home about. Then we had pasta and the risotto with black truffle. The risotto was nice, however although the pasta was cooked al dente the flavors were just not there.Main course venison and shrimp, both nicely presented, flavor good, but again for the price and surcharge, Ive had way better. Dessert, well after all disappointments I did not expect much.. the dessert was actually a highlight and was presented nice with a good taste.Rating:Price -1quality 2Service 4I did mention during the meal that the food was below average, but besides a simple apology from the waiter I did not feel like the restaurant cared. For the price of the restaurant (check of $300.00) I would expect differently and would expect a manager or chef to check on the table...Overall if you prefer Italian, there are so many restaurants that are around the same price or even cheaper and are worth it.Masseria unfortunately isnt one of them.I will not return nor will I have our team send any other guests over to the restaurant., We went to Masseria last night for my birthday dinner with my family and it was such a disappointment. The food, for the most part, was good but service was bad. We were seated outside in the enclosed patio area, which is just sub-par in the winter despite the heaters. It cold and so loud when full. It also just a huge bummer to be seated outside when the tables inside are better and cozier. Our waitress was clueless about the food and provided useless info in response to our questions about various items on the menu. The restaurant has a policy for parties of 5 or more that everyone at the table must order the same number of courses from the tasting menu (3, 4, or 5). Two of us wanted 3 courses and 3 of us wanted 4, and although we explained that the two people who only wanted 3 courses wouldn mind sitting a course out, per se, the waitress was inflexible on this. As a result, we all just had 3 courses and the restaurant lost out on a bigger check. The responses to our both our requests, to be seated inside and to adjust their recommendation that we all have the same number of courses, were met with the weirdest, stuffiest responses. It almost too twee to describe. They are just hugely inflexible and snooty about it to boot, and it the main reason we won be returning, even though there were some great surprises on the menu. The food was good but portions tiny. Service between courses was SO SLOW but then everything would show up at once. I think the bread course was deposited just moments before our first course. The only thing I really liked about this waste of a what was meant to be a nice dinner was my prosecco cocktail with blood orange sorbet. Overall, I bummed we spent my birthday dinner at Masseria instead of a proven restaurant with excellent service., Went to dine on 2/26. Send the email below after few days to the email address on their website. No answer. Sent a private message on their Facebook page. No answer. Wrote an old school letter and mailed it to them. Guess what? Exactly.Mister Stefanelli, about one thing I am wrong: there is something bigger than your immense talent: your arrogance.Dear Chef Stefanelli,my name is Biagio Cepollaro and I dined at Masseria last night, Friday the 26th, along with my wife and another couple. I sent this email to the address provided on Masseria website and I want to make sure you received it.Let me start off by telling you how good and exquisite the food was (the persico, the wild board ragu, the different desserts we had) and how great was the service offered by Mo and his team. The restaurant per seis beautiful, the beverage program is well researched and perfectly executed. An home run.I do have one note for you though: I had a reservation for 9pm for party of four and three of us were at your restaurant at 9pm sharp. I personally received a text message at 8:30 informing me that my reservation was due in thirty minutes. We were informed upon our arrival that we are little behind, your table will be ready soon. We were seated at 10:15pm. 75 minutes later.We had no problem in be seated late, later; we do understand that everyone wants to enjoy your food as long as they can and we do understand that even on a Friday night with a late reservation people might wait a bit, say 15 minutes, 30 minutes or even 75 minutes. We do understand and accept it.What we don understand and accept, it the complete lack of communication from your managers that for 70 minutes keep walking up and down the restaurant and had no courtesy to check with us while we were waiting at the bar. Not a simple sorry guys things are getting a little longer nor a you have to wait just a little bit more since everyone loves Chef Stefanelli food so much that they don want to leave!. Nothing, not even an eye contact to acknowledge the issue. I do understand that the drinks we consumed at the bar were comped, thank you we appreciate it, and you sent 4 arancini as a welcome, thanks again. What is not understandable is how we (nobody else waited like us, nobody else waited, period) have been so poorly treated by your staff that clearly does not care about the patrons of your restaurants, or at least did not care about us.It is a shame that your immense talent could be overshadowed by someone that has such a little understanding of the word hospitality.With that said I will definitively come back to enjoy your creations (but I will avoid the linguine XO!) with the hope to be considered worth of a better level of communication from your staff, because I know I am.Thank you for taking the time to read this email., I have not written a Yelp review in quite a while, but my recent experience at Masseria compelled me to get back start writing again. I do not think I have ever experienced a restaurant as inflexible as Masseria in my life. I was excited to try this place, as the recent reviews and hype would suggest and the menu is quite interesting. But my experience with the management of this restaurant has made it a sure thing that I will never be stepping foot in this establishment again.I had a 7pm reservation on a Friday evening to celebrate a birthday. We showed up a little bit early and asked if we could sit in the main dining room (a pretty dining room in which you can watch the open kitchen), but they said they would not have anything available until 9:30, as if we were a walk-in. They put us at a table directly under a strong heating lamp at the front of the adjacent patio type dining room. The problem was that this table is not meant for regular height people to sit as...they are actually raised picnic style tables with normal height chairs. As a male of regular height, the table came up to chest high on me...so you can imagine how high it would come up to on my 5 mother. So the raised picnic style table was inappropriate. The only other table they could offer was the one right next to the door where the cold air was rushing in every time the door was open. When we asked if we could sit at a different table next to that one, they said that we couldn have that table because they were going to be pushing a lot of tables together to make a party of 12. So on top of being at an uncomfortable table to begin with, they were going to put us right next to a large party. The management was unaccommodating, inflexible and unapologetic. Upon this, we decided to leave the establishment and thankfully nabbed a last-minute reservation at another restaurant (and ended up having a wonderful evening and meal at that other restaurant). I sure that the restaurant will try to flag this post or argue with their policies were correct, but this is the truth of what happened. In a city that has a lot of wonderful restaurants, both big and small, there is no reason to go to this one that doesn seem to want your business., For the life of me, I cannot understand how every review on this website is not 5 stars.I originally stumbled upon Masseria with my boyfriend last fall and fell in love with the space. Although my boyfriend and I only had drinks that night, he knew that he wanted to dine at Masseria on 4/8, for his 26th birthday. Months went by as we anticipated our visit for the full dining experience and in the weeks leading up to his birthday, I easily made a reservation via Rezy. One week before the birthday, I emailed the team at Masseria to confirm the reservation and to request that a bottle of champagne be chilled on the table for when we arrived. They were very happy to make this accommodation. I ended up arriving to the restaurant after my boyfriend on the day of, which made it a little tricky to sneak a birthday card onto the table next to the surprise bottle of champagne. However, this was no problem. It clear that whenever there is a special occasion or someone has made a special request via phone or email, the entire team is prepped for it. Upon walking in, I immediately spoke with a young gentleman (who ended up being our sommelier), explained my unintended tardiness, and slipped him my card. He told me that he remembered my request from the email--down to the type of champagne that was requested--and that he would take care of getting the table set up. Our reservation was for 9pm but we were not seated until about 9:30. This is understandable, as the space is so unique and cosy, so I not surprised that people like to come, taste, and truly enjoy the food. While we continued to wait at the bar, the same sommelier that had greeted us poured us complimentary glasses of champagne. What a lovely touch in addition to the surprise champagne already waiting at the table! Fast forward to the actual dining experience--all I can say is wow! Upon checking our coats, the lovely woman at the coat check told my boyfriend enjoy your birthday! Upon being seated, the sommelier and our waiter also said, happy birthday! Little touches like that really do make you feel like your patronage is valued. We opted for the 5-course tasting menu and my boyfriend went for the wine pairing. Admittedly, this can be an expensive venture, but for every once in a while, why not! The attention to detail is insane, the flavors one of a kind. The staff are warm, knowledgeable, and funny. We had great conversations with our sommelier, Philip, and our main server, Stefan. Both truly enhanced the already amazing food on our plates. Watching the chef literally plate our food was even more special. I can tell that he is a man that cares about his craft and the individuals that he serves. We truly felt like we were given 5-star treatment and my boyfriend had a smile on his face from beginning to end. I cannot thank Masseria enough for making this night so special for the both of us. This time, I will not wait months to return!, Masseria is easily one of my three favorite restaurants in DC right now. The food, especially the pasta, is absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. The cocktails are interesting and well balanced. And the restaurant itself is beautifully laid out. It feels like a secret hideaway, but one that was styled for a design magazine.The tasting menu is a similar price point to other tasting menus at comparable restaurants in the city, but with more flexibility. Dessert is always one of your courses, but otherwise you are free to choose the other 3-4 courses from any section of the menu. Want three pastas? You got it! A fish, a steak, and a duck dish? Thats fine too! I havent had a bad dish, but the egg ravioli and macheronni with fresh fava beans that I tried on my last visit were particularly satisfying.But maybe one of my favorite bites at Masseria is the first bite, included with every meal, the ciabatta with the tomato sauce. That tomato sauce reduction--so thick it looks like preserves--is like the best bit of tomato sauce off the side of the pan when youre making homemade pasta sauce. I only wish they jarred it and offered it for sale. The bread plate also came with arancini and another little pouf of deliciousness--making the bread plate truly exceptional., Masseria was fantastic. My family and I each had the 3 course option and everything was wonderful. Arancini & focaccia to start, I had the asparagus w bottarga and the halibut w baby octopus - the foie gras was excellent, and the cheese selection which we opted for for dessert was awesome. Great atmosphere, and a notable wine list. Highly recommend!, Wonderful, memorable meal in an exciting buzzing dining room with a great terrace and seating looking into the kitchen where you have a front row seat for Nicolas Steffanelli at his best. Many superior wines by the glass. The rhubarb with the foie gras was amazing., Modern and sexy - I sat on the patio and had cocktails and small plates. Would like to come back for the full tasting menu. The calamari and lamb ribs were excellent., Masseria had been at the top of my list of places to dine if/when we made it back to DC. The wife and I had been big fans of Chef Stefanelli when he was at Bibiana. Since the wife and I were going to be in town for a wedding, we made reservations online via Resy for the Chef Table on our first night in town, a Thursday night, at 7:30 pm. Reserving the Chef Table required advance payment (included tax and service charges) for all diners, which was a tidy sum to pay upfront for a meal. However, we were to be joined for dinner by dear friends with whom celebrations were long overdue, so it was worth the price of admission to me.We arrived about 15 minutes early for our reservation. Our table was going through the finishing touches on setup so we had to wait a couple of minutes to be seated, which allowed the opportunity to take in the space. Masseria is not your father Italian restaurant with red and white checkerboard tablecloths and fiasco bottles of Chianti in straw baskets. The fact that Masseria was a standalone structure rather than a renovated rowhouse or in a place like City Center made it unique from almost every other restaurant that I want to dine at in the city. It possessed a rustic, yet modern, aesthetic that was eye-catching without pretention.Once we were seated, the fun began. We weren given dinner menus, only the wine and cocktail lists. The Chef Table was a multi-course meal consisting of chef-selected dishes. I started off with a cocktail, the We Did It All For Don ($14), made with Smith & Cross Rum, Fino sherry, lime, cinnamon, passion fruit, and nutmeg. To me, it was a delicious mashup of a tiki drink and a winter holiday punch. I loved it. However, getting the cocktail was a slight mistake since Masseria also offered a wine pairing with its La Cucina Menu. As a result, I was still finishing my cocktail by the time our first course and wine was served and was playing catchup for the first few courses. (Pro tip: Get to Masseria early enough to order a cocktail and finish it at a leisurely pace before being seated, then order the wine pairing.) That said, the wine pairing was truly inspired and enlightening, and was easily one of best marriages of wine and food that Ie experienced. My only regret was forgetting to ask the sommelier for the list of wines we were served.Frankly, I have no idea of how many courses we received. It seemed like food just kept coming out to our table. Each course was obviously made with fresh, premium ingredients, and beautifully presented. The bread course was delicious and varied. The pasta was a perfect al dente and possessed the flavor and mouth feel of fresh made pasta. The sole was cleverly presented, moist, and delightful. The sweetbread and tripe in an anchovy-infused broth was the one course that was least enjoyed by the table. I loved it. However, I could easily understand how it may not be for everyone since it was easily the most-challenging dish in terms of its components, texture, and flavor profile. The Foie-nnoli, a cannoli shell filled with foie gras and capped on each end with black truffles, was pure indulgence and probably the dish that had everyone at the table talking about the most. It was paired with a Marsala Oro, dispelling all of my preconceived notions of Marsala. It was a perfect pairing and surprise of the night.Dining at Masseria was a long time coming for us, but it was definitely worth the wait. Everything, from service to the food and drinks, was exactly what I hoped it would be...and more! The Chef Table experience was not a cheap night out. However, I felt that we got our money worth. If you have a party of 4-6 and youe in celebration mode, then I can only say, Do it!, First Thought before Review:If someone asked me for one take away from this place I would say be prepared for a long evening. That is to say our two person meal took 2.5 hours and it wasn just us, there were several patrons in the restaurant there for equal time. I a fan of not being rushed, but holy hell at some point it just a little bit too long.Executive Summary:The decor and ambiance are definitely winners here but for $250 as a couple I found the food to be poorly timed, forgettable, and lacking any distinct amount of flavor that would drive me to recommend this restaurant over several other high profile entrants in the DC market. They have a robust wine list and a nice courtyard which would be attractive to a high spending happy hour set but over all I think you can do better in selecting a restaurant. Decor:The atmosphere of this place is really cool. For the time being there ample parking out front, and they have a really neat courtyard with couches and heat lamps and fire pits. This leads in to an inner courtyard that is half outside-half inside, that also has heat lamps and a television, before giving way to an interior portion of the restaurant. If youe making a reservation, make sure you ask not to be seated at the table next to the door to the inner/outer patio. It literally a foot from the door you walk in. The kitchen is open so you can see what everyone is doing and they did a really good job designing the place so it looks quaint and welcoming.Attire: I would dress nicely if youe going here. No need to be in a suit but you be way out of place without a collar and not out of place at all in a suit and tie. If youe wondering, err on the more formal side. Cost:My date and I each went with the 4 course pairing. Despite what their website says they have a three, four, five, and six course that starts at 3- $68, 4-$75, 5-$85 and I can remember how much the six course was. One of the courses must be desert. They have an in house sommelier and wine pairings are available at extra charge. Either way, be prepared to spend some money here. Food:The menu changes often so don take the website as gospel. They will start you with four different varieties of bread and each plate will be proportional to how many courses you ordered. From the starters menu we had the Carne Cruda lamb tartar and Trippa beef tripe with Lobster. Each were delicious and I highly recommend both plates.Our second courses were a pasta with scorpion fish and the lasagna. The lasagna was delightful and had a veal ragu, I highly recommend this dish. I was wholly unimpressed with the scorpion fish pasta. To start it was difficult to tell if it was to be served hot or cold, since we received it somewhere in between. The fish was uninspired and the pasta forgettable. Our third courses were a goat sausage with potatoes and the halibut with baby squid, lentils and squid ink. The goat was chewy and tough, which was too be expected but it was also relatively flavorless. The halibut was also pretty bland, served somewhere between warm and cold and the two pathetic little baby squid were doused in squid in which added some mild flavor but nothing overwhelming. For desert we had 3 cheeses (which costs an additional $10) and berry, gelato, crosta dish. It hard to screw up cheese and the gelato dish was good but not particularly unique or memorable.They end the night with two pieces of desert bread and two small cannolis which had obviously been hanging out in the refrigerator for some time. In total we had 3 glasses of wine, and two old fashions. Final tab was $250., Outstanding ambience, service and food !!! The kitsch and chef did a great job delivering fantastic food. Sitting at the counter side tables looking into the kitchen was amazing., Incredible tasting menu. Ate at the bar and it was still an amazing experience. Our bartender was super attentive and made excellent recommendations to go along with our 4 course dinner. Meal started with a serving of their savory donut holes and cod fritters in a lemon aioli. Both were tasty. My main entr39e was the roasted halibut with octopus and black ink sauce over fennel which had the perfect balance of flavors. But the highlight of the meal was the black truffle risotto - from the secret menu ;) I will definitely return and try out some other dishes I was eyeing., I highly recommend this place if youre looking for a special dinner with a significant other. Although highly priced, it is well worth the experience. We ordered the 3-course and 4-course meals. When the kitchen got slightly backed up, it was neatly covered by adding a light dessert. The meals also arrived in good time, just as we finished one course, and next was ready to arrive. Each course was thoughtfully explained as it was placed in front of us. I recommend paying extra for the 3 or 5 cheese tray. Im recommending to my friends., On entering the place, I couldnt help but notice the scent of privilege from the (mostly white) clientele. Waited around fifteen minutes for our reserved table (empty and set when we walked passed on our way to the host stand). Once seated, when my date and I asked to split the 5 course meal, the waiter literally stepped back, aghast at such a thought. Once he collected himself, he told us that was not an option. It was our first time dining there and we had a late reservation so neither of us was that hungry, and I didnt see anywhere in the menu that splitting is NOT allowed. The service was surprisingly mediocre and inattentive. 3 course meal without drinks (2 mains/starters + dessert) starts at $68 per person. Took a while to get the food, which was very good, but not worth it. Would not go back. The only beer on draft was a local IPA and $12. Its not like this place in Georgetown and is an small batch import draft... I would understand the draft price a little bit more then. Its in a wholesale industrial park!, Not sure why this place gets negative reviews.... The food is outstanding! Do plan on spending a good 2-3 hours there if you order the 4-5 courses. Aside from the long dining experience, there is nothing else to complain about.... Well, if only we had gotten an extra serving of the lamb Ragu lasagna., My friends and I had a wonderful dinner experience at Masseria. There was an extra person in our reservation so we did have to wait an additional 30 minutes for our table - which is understandable since its a pretty intimate restaurant, albeit spacious. The restaurants staff was amazing - host, runners, waiter, manger. Ive been on this gluten-free and dairy-free diet, and was worried that there wouldnt be many options. There were tons!The waiter spent a lot of time answering all my questions.You have the option of 3 course, 4 course, or 5 course of there set menu (maybe more, I cant remember). Of those courses, 1 must be dessert, and the rest can be anything. You can choose numerous entrees or pastas, all appetizers, whatever you want. I loved this flexibility. I ordered the grilled asparagus as my first course. It came out as one large white asparagus. It was fresh and light, I enjoyed it. My next course was the fungi dish. There were so many different types of mushrooms. It was pretty good, but on the salty side. My third course was the halibut and squid. It was decent, but nothing too memorable. I passed on dessert, but they all looked amazing!Its definitely on the pricey side, but I will be returning!, Had a reservation for 730 on a tuesday and was seated immediately. It is in an odd location ill give you that. Ample parking on the outside, however. The interior is very cozy as they have heat lamps on every side, so you would never feel a cold draft even though it looks like the walls are just single metal sheets. It felt like a venice beach type of vibe. Just missing the LA sunset. Casual but definitely not casual dining. The waiters were business on top, jeans and sneakers on the bottom.Anyway, the most important part of the review - the food makes this our new favorite place in dc! We came for our anniversary dinner. You can choose 3-5 courses from any section of the menu with one course being dessert. I had the rabbit lasagna to start and it was very good and not too big of a portion size. Halibut for the main and that was really light and flaky. I liked that it was not over-dressed to cover the flavor of the fish. For dessert, I had the crostata. Funny enough, the ice cream with cardomom and something else was the best dessert - not sure what it was as we couldnt really hear the waiter over the noise. Either way it was amazing. I had a taste of my husbands dishes, i liked the linguine the best out of his dishes. And they give you bread in a box if you have a pasta dish. Pretty funny. There were many people waiting in the lounge area for a table. When we left at 10pm, some parties were just getting seated. Eating on european time here.A+ for food and service. Had a great time and will definitely be itching to come back soon.
41|mastros-steakhouse-washington|I was in DC this weekend with a couple of friends and we decided to stop in. We wanted a great meal and found it here! I had the Rack of Lamb and it was extremely tender and flavorful. My friends opted for the Strip steak I think. We added the lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus for sides and all were great! We were completely full after this but opted to try a dessert that was recommended by our waitress and I think we all ate way too much. I will suggest sharing a couple sides because they are huge portions! This place is definitely worth every penny!, This review is based on the soft opening. They did an absolutely great job. Everything was flawless, even for a VERY high volume soft opening. The place was absolutely packed but they managed to keep up with the demand even for some of the popular items (like the steak). The decor was really cool, pretty classy looking. They had an awesome trio of performers singing top 40, who apparently are going to be playing there on the reg, which is legit. Bartenders were all super fast and super friendly. Great spot, great soft opening, looking forward to updating my review when I come back for dinner., This may have been the finest dining experience Ie had since Berns in Tampa, which is considered to be one of the best steak houses in the world. We were seated to live music playing and our server Katie promptly joined us and took no time in making sure we knew the way they did things. We lucked out in that she is one of the Soms at the place and studied wine making. Her recommendations were fantastic and she actually heard what we wanted for appetizers and made some suggestions we loved. I had the shrimp cocktail, steak carpaccio, French onion soup and the bone in filet, another call I took from our server and was bowled over by it. I ordered the cheesecake and was greeted with a smirk from our server and a do you trust me so we all took her word for it. She delivered their signature butter cake and it was incredible. All in all if I could do a ten star review I would. The bill was not small by any means but Mastros is an experience. From the food, to the class and charm of the staff to the room. It an experience I will be having again and again., Thank you for deciding to open a location in DC! I was first introduced to Mastro in 2010 in Las Vegas in the Shops at City Center. When I found out we were getting our own version of the treehouse I was ecstatic. The food was fabulous and the service was excellent. The only problem is the lighting!!! I totally understand what kind of vibe Mastro is attempting to accomplish, BUT when customers cannot see the people at your table, the menu, their server or the food on the plate in front of them without a flashlight, you might want to bring the lights up slightly. I asked several staff members, including management to bring the lights because the darkness was almost unbearable, but NO ONE granted my request!! I was asked if I wanted to move to another table, but I explained to the woman that moving me was not going to solve the lighting problem.There was a moment when they brought the lights up for a second, but then someone turned them back down. Several customers clapped letting staff know their approval, but back down the lights went. I am sure that I am not the only customer that would like to see their $150 meal. It appeared that the dining area downstairs had better lighting, but needing an escort to maneuver a restaurant is not a good look:-(TURN THE DAMN LIGHTS UP!, Ie been a fan of Mastro since dining at their Vegas location a little over a year ago. I was thrilled to find Mastro was finally making its way to the east coast.Like the true Mastro Stan that I am, I made sure that I was present opening night to dine on their signature butter cake and my favorite - the escargot. Unsurprisingly I was not disappointed. The service- impeccable, and the food delicious as always. Despite my butter cake coming out cold, my waiter (Hamien- who provided superior service) promptly delivered a fresh, warm, butter cake and comp the dessert for the mishap. All in all, this was a great dining experience. Whenever youe feeling like a million bucks and don mind splurging on yourself (we all deserve it from time to time), I strongly recommend Mastro., A couple of nights ago after a gala event, my friends and I opted to check out Mastros for a late night dinner. My boyfriend, whos from California, was super stoked that Mastros had opened in DC, claiming that the food was delicious. We were able to get a table for four without any reservations. The inside is very dim. I recognize that steakhouses seem to prefer this very subdued, intimate lighting, but honestly I thought the lighting was a little too muted. It was difficult to read the menu unless I positioned it in just the right place where some much desired light fell on it. The dining area is separate from the bar area, which had TVs going and live music. Oh, and their bathrooms are fully stocked! There was a little bar cart filled with essential bathroom goodies like mouthwash, hairspray, body mist, etc. I decided to go for the seared sea scallops, which were delicious. They didnt skimp on quantity either. I had a few bites of my boyfriends chefs cut ribeye chop (33 oz) which was cooked perfectly. We ended up taking home most of the ribeye since it was enormous and it fed us for a good couple of days. The only downside was the service. From the moment we sat down, service was a little off. We waited for about 15 minutes to get water, even after we told a server that we had been waiting and that the table next to us didnt even get water and they had been there well before us. When someone finally came to pour water, there was only enough for two of us and the server said he had to go get more. Well, he didnt come back for another 5-10 minutes and in the meantime, our actual server stopped by to take our orders. We all gave our orders, which he slowly wrote down on a pad. Then, we mentioned again that the other two members of our party wanted water. So water finally came after another 5 minutes. Later, our server came by to ask two of us what we ordered. Hmm, even after he had been writing everything down. That didnt seem to bode well. Right before our appetizers came, another server came by to apologize for the service and said that he would be our server from now on. From that point on, service was a little better. He brought us our meals fairly quickly and addressed our needs in a timely fashion, as I would expect of a steakhouse like Mastros.Food is delicious and well prepared. The service needs a little more work, although they just opened so Im sure theyre working out the kinks. I think once that goes up, Mastros will become a true contender in DCs steakhouse scene, ranking high up there with the other local legendary steakhouses., I am beyond impressed with this place! I was a little concern because its different ownership than the Beverly Hills location, BUT the team here doesnt disappoint. Im a foodie and have visited many restaurants in the DC metro area and all over.Pros - Entertainment. Singer and Pianist M-Sat, 6pm-9:30pm. Prefer the lady singers over the guy pianist singing. Can he just play the piano?Drinks - 2 cocktails for the price of 1. Youre given a shaker including your already poured cocktail. :-)Service - Excellent and attentive.Cons - Cocktails are pricey, $19 and a glass of Veuve is $30. Way more expensive than Del Friscos, Joes and STK. - Too Dark, please add dim lighting, so people can see what they are eating!, This is NOT your fathers Sizzler Steakhouse, I can assure you of that!! When you come to Mastros beware of sticker shock. I have been waiting patiently for Mastros to open up for some time now after having the opportunity to dine at their Scottsdale location several times. I have been bragging to all of my friends that Mastros City Hall in Scottsdale hands down has been my finest dining experience so with that being said, Mastros has arrived in DC to take a strangle hold on the high end steakhouse market. Previously the M&S Grill, Mastros knew the space was not big enough for what they wanted to do and that is TOTAL DC STEAKHOUSE DOMINATION..lol... so they had to either build up or dig down, they chose the latter! This Mastros has a huge lower level with a full service bar with actually more seating than upstairs. I was given the grand tour last week when I stopped in for drinks and appetizers. What are you getting for this hefty price tag? AWESOME service! These folks make sure youre well taken care of and they break their backs to put a smile on your face. The food: My favorite here is the rack of lamb and although I remember the Scottsdale location having a tad larger serving size, the lamb here is still 22 ounces of pure taste bud heaven!! The Mac & Cheese made me think my lovely grandmother came back to life and took up shop in the kitchen..smh! My HOT date, my partner in crime Anh D had the Filet. She likes her meat burnt (Med Well) shame on her. I had a bite and it was still extremely tasty but I like mine a little more red than that..lol. I have had the Bone-In Ribeye at the Scottsdale location and man was that thing good! You also get nightly entertainment in the happening bar/lounge area. Not only do you get the Grand piano player but you also get a soloist singing the most popular tunes!In conclusion, Ladies if a man is taking you here then he may be a keeper!! Five gold stars for him!!! LOL, So happy to have one of my SoCal faves on the east coast!All though our waiter was still getting into the swing of things,the food was absolutely amazing as it is back home in Cali.The Key Lime martini is a must try ;), DC has always been a town with over-the-top restaurants for the expense account crowd. As the city food profile has grown, so too has its share of high end restaurants, with several out of town purveyors of fine meats entering the steakhouse scene. It is against that backdrop that we recently dined at Mastro, the newest entrant to this scene.If you have ever been to M&S Grill, you would not recognize the repurposed space. The ambiance was nice - tasteful and hipper than a traditional steakhouse while remaining classy. The lighting is quite dim, creating a romantic atmosphere even though the tables are fairly closely spaced. One of the highlights was the live music from the bar, which Mastro has seven nights a week.Service was very good, if not exceptional. We were there for a special occasion and the waiter acknowledged the occasion when he first approached the table and, again, at the end with a complementary desert. Sides were personally served to each diner, three people came by to check on our steaks, and wine and water glasses were always full. My only critique would be a couple waits at the start of the meal.The food had hits and misses. A seared ahi tuna starter was delicious. Steaks were very good, but did not quite live up to expectations. A filet came out slightly undercooked (but quickly corrected). Steaks had good flavor, but I tend to like a nice crust and a caramelization of the fat, both of which were missing (possibly due to Mastro wet marinade). Shoestring potatoes were crispy and plentiful, but roasted brussel sprouts were burnt and lacked flavor. Disappointing for $14.The complementary chocolate cake was as delicious as it was large and a nice finishing touch. Coffee was also excellent and served in a large cup.Overall, the meal was very good, but for the food itself we would give a slight edge to Joe. That said, they have only been open for two weeks, and we will need to return if nothing else to try the famed warm butter cake -- perhaps at the bar while we enjoy the live entertainment., When and what: Saturday night, party of 4, 4 glasses of wine; 4 cesar salads to start; main course 2 6oz filetes and one 8oz one, and one lobster roll, large order of brussel sprouts and french fries for the table to share; 1 signature butter cake to share and 3 coffees for dessert. Cost: $270, including $34 tipServer Antonio: friendly, polite, but overly talkative, probably trying too hard, not a refined wait stuff; never brought ketchup requested; longer than average wait for main course to arrive for a dinning room 1/2 full at 9 30pm; overcharged us for the 2 6oz fillets, 8oz prices, his apologies sounded less than sincere. Food is good, but not especially so. I ordered my meat medium, it came medium rare, and consequently just kind of warm; might have been sitting too long, waiting to be taken out to the dining area.Overall service: many people waiting, maybe too many, I dont need an assistant in the bathroom to open the water faucet and splash soap in the palm of my hand, especially if hes going to splash it on my clothes and mumble an oops and an mmhmm sounds. Was that the equivalent of Im sorry? Not sure; but I tipped a $1 anyway for laughs.Positives: great live entertainment, signature butter cake.Charlie Palmer, theyve got nothing on you.This place is rough around the edges and overpriced. I think it will have its flash in the pan period, and quickly go into the wannabe category.One more thing, the dress code a joke; not enforced. Basically, jeans and t-shirts are fine., This restaurant is going to be great but it is not there yet. As of 5/24/15, the restaurant is two weeks old and is going through some serious growing pains. Expect to have a great dining experience interspersed with distracting problems. For a restaurant with this price tag, Id recommended waiting until they get a little more experience under their belt. Food: Superb. The steak is delicious of course but the appetizers, side dishes, and desserts actually stood out as more impressive. Shellfish is served with dry ice for a unique presentation. The sides are served straight from the pan so they are extremely fresh and crispy. The desserts are scrumptious and absurdly large (the pecan pie could have easily fed four). Despite the taste being great, there were some problems. Our steak was unevenly cooked and the dry ice contraption actually led to some of the appetizers falling through the cracks which stole some dearly desired bites. Ambiance: Disappointing. The restaurant looks beautiful. Unfortunately, there was a live band playing through the restaurants speakers which was far too loud. In addition, they were playing pop music in an overly stylized manner. When indulging in a steak dinner, I am not in the mood for Taylor Swift blasting loud enough to interrupt conversation. In addition, it was incredibly dark. I had a lot of trouble seeing how well the steak was cooked, let alone reading the menu. Service: The staff was incredibly friendly and informative which is a huge plus. There were a lot of mistakes unfortunately. The bartender did not know how to make one of the cocktails listed in their menu and it took half an hour to arrive. The wrong food was brought to the table. Lastly, there were errors on the bill.The food is great and the staff are friendly but the restaurant is new so hold off until they are able to find their groove., Definitely 5 stars all around!I came here for my birthday dinner and was greeted with birthday wishes and a card from the staff. How thoughtful!! We were escorted to our table and from the time we sat down to the time we left, our every whim was catered to! For starters, the dream berry was absolutely delicious! Best tasting cocktail Ive had in a while. We ordered the shrimp tempura, which was amazing! Whew! Honestly after the shrimp tempura, we were already stuffed!We also ordered house salads prior to our main courses. I ordered the petite filet and my handsome date ordered the bone-in ribeye. We also shared the brussel sprouts and LOBSTER MASHED POTATOES!!! The steaks were cooked to perfection and the lobster mashed potatoes were absolutely DELICIOUS!! WOW! IT WAS WORTH EVERY BITE!Let me also mention the fact that we had a very attentive server and Isabella came over quite often to ensure that we were having an awesome dining experience. We topped off dinner with the AMAZING signature BUTTER CAKE!!! You MUST order this when you dine here. It is the BEST Ive ever had!!! Hats off to this amazing restaurant and staff (special thanks again to Isabella!!!)!! You made my birthday dinner celebration one to always remember! Another nice touch was the follow up call to my handsome and hot date asking about our experience. TOP NOTCH., Great experience! My wife and I went here for our anniversary and it was definitely a good pick!Service was really on par. Our waiter was on top of his game and really sealed the deal with us. He knew what he was doing and what he was saying. The food was amazing! Started with the lobster bisque, which was good, but I wouldnt say it was amazing. My wife had a salad which she loved. Then from a recommendation from a couple sitting next to us, we got the lobster mashed potatoes, which were AMAZING!! I got the porterhouse and my wife got the bone-in filet. Our steaks were so good we had no room for desert. We will definitely be back here, especially for their desert! Its definitely one of the more pricier places youre going to have dinner at, especially if you get a bottle of wine like we did. But, it was definitely worth it! They bring up the level of good dining!The only thing that I would say I wish was a little different is their table arrangement. Where we sat, my wife was on a bench seat that covered about 5 tables and I was sitting across in a chair. But, the spacing between each table was very small. I felt a little too close to the people sitting next to us. So close, in fact, that we couldnt NOT listen to them., Horrible service. Was dressed in a nice Guess sleeveless shirt and black pants and kicked out for not having appropriate clothing., I have experienced Mastros in Southern California many times. This new comer is a good interpretation of the west coast feel. It still needs a little perfection . The sushi is a pass , the steak sashimi is ok , the salad, was as always top knotch, - save room for desert. The drinks were great and ample -better than I remember in Newport or Beverly Hills.  Next time I will try the bone in steaks that that will be the deciding factor on my final take on the West Coasts best steak house., Im not impressed with this placed since its billed as the top steak house. First we had a reservation and they sat us down in the hot basement at the bar. When I told them of the Temperature they then sat us in the bar area on the main floor. Ive never had a reservation and had to sit in the bar area twice. Customer service is ok. Food is just ok and nothing memorable. Had the filet and lobster mashed potatoes. It was reviewed as a pound of lobster and was no where near that. Filet was ok. For steak like I said will stick with BLT and seafood would stick with Joes. Step it up for the price and attitude. Will not return., Underwhelmed. Go to Joes or lots of other places in the area (BLT, Double Eagle). I wish I had. The steak was flavorful and prepared well. The lobster mashed potatoes (a small amount of lobster on top of a huge portion of average mashed potatoes for $35) didnt come close to expectations. In an article in WaPo, they talked a pound of lobster and showed a picture backing that up. Thats not what came out. I didnt eat anything at this restaurant that Id necessarily ever want to eat again.The food was topped off by strange service. There were a lot of open tables everywhere and I had a reservation. I was seated in the downstairs bar area at a high-top next to a group of guys standing around drinking pushing chairs around which made a really loud noise. As an alternative, I was offered a seat in the upstairs bar area. The server came out and asked if I was hungry or thirsty which seemed odd given that I was at a restaurant for a dinner reservation (maybe she thought my location was better suited for a quick cocktail too). Forgettable food. Weak service. I cant think of any reason to go back, especially given the other options in the area., Wonderful atmosphere, delicious food and drinks, magnificent team members (Jarrett and Tee are incredible!!!) -- whats not to adore? I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant for any occasion., I would give Mastros a solid 3.5 stars. I was here for lunch with some coworkers a couple weeks ago. We ordered some appetizers, sides, and each had an entree. My ahi tuna burger was just okay. I was expecting a little more flavor, and the texture was a bit crumbly and hard to keep together. The mac and cheese was very good, and the brussels sprouts were also fairly good. I will say that the service was excellent. I thought that our servers were friendly, attentive, professional, and knowledgeable about the menu. Even though I wasnt wowed by the food, I would come back and give it another go simply because of the excellent service that we were provided., I really enjoyed my dinner here. The wine selection was good and of course the steak was flavorful and delicious. I had the petite 5 oz and paired it with the creamed spinach it was just enough. My date had the 22 oz bone in and it was massive and he couldve used a butter knife to cut. Save room for the butter cake, I dont normally partake in desert but that cake was AWESOME!!! The best part was the duo at the bar! Thought they had on the radio they sounded just like the artist! Really great evening., Went to celebrate my boyfriends birthday on 7/17/2015 and was disappointed in our overall experience. I had spoke with the Mastros staff twice in regard to my reservation, letting them know that we were celebrating a milestone birthday, etc. Upon arrival, we were immediately sat in the bar area. I was totally confused as to why we were sat there especially considering that we had a reservation. My boyfriend insisted that I not make a fuss and ruin his day, so I didnt say anything to the wait staff. We decided to stay in the bar area and make the best of the evening. THE FOOD:Food was pretty decent. We had the shrimp cocktail for an appetizer. Presentation was awesome, cocktail sauce VERY spicy. If youre not a fan of spice, opt for a different sauce. The steak was flavorful (a bit under cooked, but still good). The lobster mashed potatoes are good, but not a must-have, especially for $35. Creamed corn was OK. We had to remind our server that we were there celebrating a birthday, but she was super accommodating in getting the famous butter cake over to us which was delicious! Id say that was my favorite part of the meal. THE DRINKS:Lemondrop and birthday cake shots were delicious! THE SERVICE:Our waiter was great. Very knowledgeable of the menu and provided great suggestions. AMBIANCE:About 10 minutes after our arrival and seating at the bar, the live band came back from their break. The band is really good and very interactive, but I was not prepared for the loud atmosphere. Apparently, you cant hear the band in the dining area, but again, we werent seated there like we should have. As we were leaving, we noticed that a table had been placed right outside of the bar in front of the elevator where a couple was dining. Not only was this tacky, but Im sure it had to have been some type of fire hazard. OVERALL:Mastros is too expensive of a restaurant with far too great of a reputation for all of this to have taken place. I was extremely disappointed that I paid over $200 to sit at the bar. Im sure the experience would have been different had we sat in the dining area. We probably will not return as weve had far greater experiences at other steakhouses in the DMV for half the cost., Went there for dinner last night for a work dinner and we had a blast. We started with the seafood tower...what a presentation and delicious and tender selfish and oysters. I ordered the caesar salad and it was one of the best versions I have had in a long while. I ordered the 12 ounce bone in filet...juicy and tender. For sides, my favorite was the creamed spinach and the shoe string fries (wasnt impressed by the brussels sprouts). Service was great and would definitely go back again!, I recently ate at Mastros Steak House and it was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had, hands down. We started with crab cakes and the seafood appetizers - which were fresh and perfectly chilled. The shrimp were large and plump. I was with friends that didnt eat seafood because they hate the fishy taste/smell but even they were impressed and eating crab cakes and lobsters commenting on the quality and flavor of the full appetizer plate. I would suggest the crab cakes-and shrimp cocktail. The steaks are massive, wish I could have finished it because it was so good but at a certain point you have to quit and save room for dessert. Aside from the great food and service the live music was amazing. If you truly want to treat yourself to a great meal and dining experience I would suggest eating here,you wont be disappointed., I am so not a fan of high priced steakhouses, but I usually suck in and go just to confirm my feeling. Ive been to STK, Ruth Chris, Prime Rib and countless others in DC. Mastros blows them all out of the water! This place was one of the best dining experiences Ive ever had. I found out about this new place and just had to try it and it definitely lived up to its hype. Valet out front is $15 which is steep but youre downtown dc, you cant find parking so pay it. When you enter there is a bar of your left, with a pianist and a lady singing live (beautiful). Theres also an area downstairs, I didnt go down there, I was seated in the main dining room. For the starter I had sushi, it wasnt the best but it wasnt the worst. I am a newbie to sushi so at this point I only like a certain kind. I cant really blame them for my mistake!For dinner I had the rack of lamb, Mac & cheese and the sauteed spinach which was all to die for. The lamb was cooked and seasoned well (full of favor), the mac & cheese was the best mac & cheese Ive had in years!I will definitely be back!, We travel the world to eat, but I can tell you where we wont be eating again...Mastros Steakhouse. OVERRATED! Food was medicore at best, service OK, but needed work. Not worth another try when the first was so very bad., I beg to differ with other reviewers. If your goal is to spend as much money as possible on an average meal - then this is the place!!! I have never spent so much for so little at a restaurant. (Steak prices go up to $200!) I ordered the petite filet, a minuscule 6-oz piece of meat, because it was the least expensive on the menu and I did not want my boss screaming at me about my travel/meal expenses. It was the tiniest steak I have ever seen. Perhaps it came from a baby cow. No, that would have been veal. And whats really funny is, they serve you this itty bitty steak on a huge platter. My colleague and I could not keep a straight face when it was served. Cocktails average $18-20 each. Salads and sides are the same as any other place. I could not even think about splurging financially on dessert. Oh, and the wait staff has to deliver a 5-minue speech about the menu and every item on it. It went on and on. One really good thing about the place - the music., Love Mastros. Frequently visit my home locations in Costa Mesa and Newport Beach so Im a fan. But waiting a hour and a half for a salad on vacation is not my idea of a good time. This location needs to get it together. My kids are starving and no food in sight. Ridiculous. The food is great but the wait is not., 1st time visiting the new DC location and I loved it, went to Mastros in Vegas back in March and I must say DC is fabulous! The Piano Bar and Live singer was amazing and they take request, this made me very happy! Our server was very sweet! The hostesses were all friendly, smiling and happy! To start I had the shrimp tempura rolls ($19) which were so big that after 3 I was nearly full and had to save room for dinner. My dream berry martini ($19) was sooooo good and it comes with a full shaker, its actually 3 full drinks. For dinner I had the bone in rib eye ($59), so juicy, seasoned and medium well. Delicious. Sides, my date and I shared the mac and cheese ($14) the best Ive ever had, what kind of cheese is that? Its like an extra extra cheese pizza, so full of flavor. Saut39ed broccoli was perfect and seasoned well ($14). I had sooo much food to take home, the portions are huge. To seal the deal, the chocolate cake was amazing, the plate read happy birthday in cursive with the cutest little candle. My experience was amazing, I loved the piano bar, our table for two was perfect! My birthday was amazing, thank you Mastros for this experience. It was so worth it, beyond worth it. Total $222 but I would do it again tonight if I could. Cant wait to come back! I love steak and DC fine dining. Ruth Chris, Joes Seafood, Bobby Vans, Prime Rib, Oceanaire...Ive been to them all and while I enjoyed them, Mastros just took the cake for me. Please keep up the good work!, I went to Mastros a few weeks ago with my girlfriends and we had the best meal of our lives. Everything was incredible. We started with the lobster sushi roll. It was magical. The sauce on the bottom is smooth and spicy and perfectly compliments the tender lobster and mango. Next we shared the bone in filet and the crab gnocchi. Both were cooked to perfection and the gnocchi is hands down the best side dish I have ever had at any restaurant. To top off all the great food, the staff was incredible. Chef Dan greeted our table and walked us through all the menu options, he gave us great recommendations. We loved everything., Loved the live music with the piano. The volume was a little loud directly in the bar but we sat at a table near the back of the restaurant and it was perfect!! Food was delicious! I ordered the Lobster. Amazing!!, Jeremy on the piano is awesome! Elle was smooth with the vocals as well! Sweet combo! Definitely coming back for more than just dessert!, (My fiance and I have checked out most of the RW steak places, so I feel we have a good handle on the Baltimore/DC major steakhouses.)First time we tried Mastro (anywhere), here for restaurant week. Tuesday at 8:15pm, with reservations. No problems seating. The restaurant was pretty full, but not packed, and there wasn really anyone waiting. Downstairs, where we ate, had a few sporadic seats. We both typically get filet mignon wherever we go, so it a standard comparison.So we both ordered the same things from the RW menu: french onion soup, filet, and butter cake.Food:The bread bowl arrived with butter and had crunchy thin crips, a tough ciabatta bread, and pretzel sticks. The pretzel sticks were, BY FAR, the best, and quite delicious. They were the only mostly soft bread option but they were very good.French Onion soup: It arrived very quickly and was a quite sizable bowl. French onion soup, to me, is almost identical wherever I go. I not a frequent consumer of it, so maybe I don have the best baseline, but it was tasty and not too full of bread. Not too salty, as some tend to be. It had a decent flavor, but nothing wow-ing. 6oz filets arrived on a huge platter. HUGE. Almost annoyingly so because they took up so much space on the table. The filets were cooked nicely and were tender. It was a bit more... piece-y in texture than I like, but still a solid good and about what I expect from a nicer steak place, however not... the best. I ordered bearnaise sauce, and we each asked for au jus when we placed our order. When our steaks arrived, the waiter informed us that the chef had to make the au jus but he would bring it right out. That was the first major pitfall because it must have been at least 15 minutes before he brought it, and only after I caught his attention and reminded him again. My fiance had actually already completely finished his filet, and mine had basically gotten cold because I waited. That was really quite unacceptable at a place like this, I thought.  The sides for restaurant week were still a la carte, so we ordered two: Gorgonzola mac and cheese, and green beans with almond slices. These two sides were each $15, which was pretty hefty, but at least the portions were generous. We have leftovers from the sides. The green beans were pretty flavorless and (for once) needed a bit more time cooking, and much more seasoning and or butter/olive oil/something/etc. I pretty sure they literally parboiled green beans in a bit of salted water and tossed in some sliced almonds.The mac and cheese was a solid good - gooey and cheesy in texture. Probably better than many mac and cheeses Ie had, but it lacked that wow factor. It seemed to be more in the seasoning than the the cooking/texture.When the waiter took away our plates, we wanted to save our sides. So he gathered up all the dishes onto a tray (a second gentlemen stood behind the tray), and proceeded to scrape up crumbs from the table. Well he just TOSSED the crumbs onto the whole tray, like, right at the sides we informed him we wanted to save. So, table crumbs probably got tossed onto our leftovers. The other guy noticed this immediately and tried to shield our food and get the guy attention sort of subtly, as he noticed I also noticed, and looked nervous and somewhat embarrassed, but the server scraping the table was pretty quick so he had done it four times and was done. Gross and unacceptable. Also, the waiter cuff would have touched my bread if I didn quickly move it. What happening when wee NOT watching? The standard seemed very low. The butter cake was very generous in portion and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, and a berry drizzle. It would have been very good if it hadn been overcooked and burnt. Only the VERY center was gooey; the outside was actually quite dry, mealy, and hard and tasted like... a burnt candle or char taste that was very off-putting. I had to choose my bites carefully to avoid the weird burnt taste. The center, however, was delicious.We did not order any wine or alcoholic beverages, but the sodas were not refillable. Each 8oz glass bottle was $5, and the milk I ordered with the dessert was another $5 glass. So $15 just in 3 beverages. Ambiance:Overall it was nice, fine, no complaints really. It was pretty standard, as far as nicer steak houses go. Not too dark, not cold, fairly comfortable chairs.To some people, the live music may be great. We opted to be away from it because it was just very loud... So we ended up downstairs. We both have decided that no matter where you go, you can get away from sports on the TV. Green Turtle, Mastro Steakhouse... apparently every bar in existence will be in view and have sports, even your fanciest steak houses. Overall, we felt it mostly hype. The food was good, but not nearly good enough to justify the prices with the service and standards. We will probably never be back., My wife and I were really looking forward to Mastros once we saw they were participating in restaurant week. Unfortunately, their menu offering was rather disappointing and the service was terrible. They had one steak option on the menu for the occasion and it was just the steak with no side item. So image a plate that is gigantic (nearly 2 wide) with a 6 oz filet on it....sort of strange. Plus it had no rub or anything that really made it unique, so we can say wed never go back for a regular meal. The service was also the worst part. Were guessing they may have been overwhelmed with restaurant week as our server was covering way to many tables and finished plates werent being cleared at all. We did notice the manager was visiting certain tables which coincidently had only ladies at them. He actually skipped over our table and spoke/flirted with the guests on either side of us, but didnt stop to check on us. To say the least, we were not impressed., An experience for sure. Been to BLT, Del Friscos, Wolfgangs, Emirels and Nine. This is up there as one of the best. Bartenders are professional and appropriate with conversation. Lobster mash was insane. Steak was incredible, cooked to perfect. The butter cake with whip cream was sick, I mean unreal. An overall fantastic dining experience. Thank you., Came here for restaurant week dinner - met expectations but by no means exceeded. Food was all good but I would never come here with their normal prices. The mambo salad that they frame as a tangy Caesar tasted just like a normal Caesar salad and the butter cake other reviewers rave about was way too sweet. No one at our table finished it, which is rare for us! Altogether solid, but not worth the extremely high prices in my opinion., Amazing food and service. The filet was so soft and flavorful. Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi was so incredible. I couldnt stop eating it even though I was stuffed. We had creamed corn, creamed spinach, and broccoli, which were pretty good. Fresh bread was perfect and to finish it off- Mastros Signature Warm Butter Cake. Man it was amazing and grateful our friend knew it was a must order. The cake and gnocchi are the two standouts. Would love to eat those all over again., Went here for restaurant week because all the reviews boasted a great steak, it was just ok though. My guest returned their entree (cold) and dessert(too sweet to eat). Honestly, Ive seen this place several times in passing and thought it was a simple independent restaurant because the sign lacks luster, but its a high end chain in several cities...who knew. Ive been to my share of fine restaurants where you have to pay additional for sides, etc., but this place doesnt provide rice, broccoli or anything. Also, a margarita cost $20, are we in Vegas or what!!! I didnt see, experience, or taste the value in this restaurant we should have gone to Ruth Chris or Capital Grille. I will not be returning. The 3 stars is for the service only, 1.5 for the food., My husband and I came here for dinner on Saturday for DC restaurant week. I was able to easily make a reservation online and we were greeted warmly and promptly by the valet and then the hostess. I knew coming here that the food would be delicious but I was not prepared for the impeccable service. Probably the best service of any restaurant I have been to. When we first arrived it was a little early and we were led into the bar area to be seated for dinner. At first I was skeptical of this location (still not entirely sure why we were seated there) but it turned out to be fun. There was live music that was really great and it was a good people watching scene. Our server was great and explained the menu to us and provided some drink recommendations. We started with the Elderflower Martini and the Skinny Diablo. We took part in the restaurant week menu which was an amazing value. We started with the french onion soup and the Mambo salad (a spicy Cesar salad) and their warm freshly made bread basket (yum carbs!) We both went with the filet and both were cooked to perfection and were melt in your mouth. We also elected to order a side of potatoes au gratin to share and they were rich and decadent (in a good way). For dessert my husband opted for the key lime pie and I went with the butter cake. Both were perfect but that butter cake was absolutely delicious! Rich and dense and the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. I cannot emphasize how good the service was here. Our server was attentive without hovering, all of the busers knew and remembered our orders and were quick with clean up. We even had a good time chatting with the valet while we waited for our car at the end of the night, they even offered to take some pictures of my husband and I. All around a great night!, Let me start with the disclaimer that this review is for restaurant week. I know that restaurants are incredibly busy during restaurant week, and I know that Mastro is relatively new. I really hope they can work some of their kinks out because the ambiance and decor are wonderful. We were extremely excited to try out Mastro, as we love steak, live music, and lounges. It an inspiring combination! We arrived at 7:30 and were surprised that it wasn very busy... at all. It still took the three hostesses 10 minutes to seat us, which was surprising but not completely off-putting. Once we were sat, we didn see our server for a while. I did notice that the groups that arrived at the same time as we did were all say in her section... And it was a BIG section. She was trying to service five tables at once, which explains why all of us received terrible service. 15 minutes to get water, 30 minutes to get drink menus, etc, etc. Did I mention that the rest of the room was empty besides her section? I don know if they purposefully were understaffed or people called off, but it made for an underwhelming evening. We couldn wait to leave! We were seated next to three gentlemen, who had to ask for cocktails and bread multiple times. They finally got bread after their meals were delivered and finished. Enough about the service though; it coulde been a fluke. The dinner menu for restaurant week was incredibly basic. We both had salads to start. I had the wedge salad, and my husband had their Caesar. They were delicious, but the quality didn surpass your basic Applebee salad. We both ordered steak for the main course. The steak was overcooked, bland, and greasy. It was served on a scorching hot serving platter. I hesitate to call it a plate at all, since a large Thanksgiving turkey could easily fit on the plate. It made the tiny steak look humorously small. When I say it was scorching, I dead serious. My rare steak continued cooking on the platter and was brown on the inside by the time I was finishing it. Dessert was their opportunity to shine though. The butter cake was warm and rich, and I consider returning just for it. Overall, we were disappointed with our experience, especially after reading such rave reviews. I really hope our experience was singular because I did love the atmosphere here., Had been hearing great things about this place so took my wife for dinner. While waiting for our table we enjoyed a couple of cocktails at the bar which had live music, a very nice touch. The atmosphere is intimate and upscale. The food, although pricey, was very good and the service was impeccable. We will definitely be going back., This is by far the best steak house Ive visited in Washington, DC! The restaurant itself is just beautiful. You can tell attention was paid to each and every detail.When we walked in, we were promptly greeted by the hostess. I gave my name explaining I had made a reservation but one of the four of us was running about 10 minutes late. The hostess asked me if I wanted to be seated or to wait at the cocktail lounge area for our 4th person. We opted to have a drink at one of the high top tables in the cocktail area.The cocktail waitress came immediately. She was extremely pleasant. We all had a glass of red wine which she recommended (neither of us know a thing about wine). It was nice.Our 4th person arrived. We paid for our cocktails and were seated at our table. We had a friendly lead waiter who had an also friendly assistant waiter.The stuffed mushrooms and the wagu beef were delicious.Yes, the place is expensive - and I mean really expensive. But, it is definitely worth it. You owe it to yourself to try it at least once., I made a reservation to eat at Mastros for my mothers birthday. Upon arrival, we were greeted warmly by the hostesses, but our waiter was rude and had a bit of an attitude. At first, I thought he was overwhelmed by the amount of table he had, but as the evening progressed I noticed he was more attentive to the tables that had a larger parties. The restaurant wasnt crowded I was a little disappointed with the lack of attention/service we received from our waiter., Great service, ambiance in cool with live music by the bar area. Food was very good, I ordered the pork chop and it was perfectly cooked and juicy. I also tried a few of the side plates, my favorite was the creamy corn. Portions are generous. Although everything was great I do think its overpriced..., They continue to impress me with service and food. This is in my opinion a classy but fun place and I applaud them!, The place is great looking, nice bar and the cocktails (Dream berry.) were fantastic, service was good, but not all that outstanding,. My appetizer was delicious, sauteed scallops, the sauce was incredibly good. We also ordered a bottle of withe wine and I was surprised that they didnt have it chill and the server put it on ice until that moment, so it took almost 1 hour to get cold enough to drink.I had also the onion soup, flavor was concentrated and so good, no enough cheese, but no bad, the place is not as dark as people previously complained,. Not manager came to greet us at any time, a lady walked around and said hello, but didnt introduced herself.For dinner we both ordered the Wagyu 8oz steak ($145.00 a piece.) it was introduced to us as the closer thing to kobe beef, but is not. We have had Kobe beef in Las Vegas and the Wagyu does not come closer, I think has way too much fat.But the side dishes were excellent, we even ordered and extra order of cream corn to take home. Having been client of Mortons Steak House for years (Which is owned by the same company.) I had higher expectations. The valet parking guys also did a great job, one of them even hold the door open for us., Had table reservations, didn get seated until a hour and thirty five minutes later. In the mean time I went to the bar & had three Dream Berries, at $20 each. Also ordered some shots etc. Once seated we ordered, the food cane come pretty quickly & had huge portions. I end up with a big olePorterhouse. Will recommend but go early! About time I was done & paid to leave I spent well over what it would cost to grocery shop for a family of four. Bring your check book people! *Giving five stars for everything MINUS the table wait., This is my second visit to Mastros. Both times I was extremely impressed with the outcome. One of my visits happened to be during restaurant week, which is normally a recipe for disaster, but by far the best meal and value Ive had during a restaurant week. I had the ribeye steak the first time around and the bone-in filet the second time. Both were delicious, but a slight edge to the filet. Ive eaten at a lot of steak places and this has to be one of my favorites. For sides, the lobster mashed potato is worth getting, a little expensive but worth it if you share with a group. Its a pricey restaurant, but I highly recommend coming here if you are looking for a great steak place., My boyfriend took me to this place during 2015 August Restaurant Week and we were super impressed! We automatically felll in love with the fancy ambience and decor as soon as you walk in (definitely want to dress to impress). Since it was our first time at this place, one of the managers came up and recommended the best seat in the house which was at an intimate half booth near the bar, in front of the live singers/pianist. We loved the live entertainment especially when they played our requested songs (Stay with Me and Fly Me to the Moon; the guy has an amazing voice and played the piano beautifully). We ordered a glass of wine, some cocktail drinks, steak, lobster mashed potatoes, and tried the buttered cake. The food came out at a nice pace, allowing us time to digest and really enjoy our dinner, and the food was delicious and served beautifully. The waitress made sure our waters were always full and even though it was busy, she always made time to stop by and made sure we were okay. Overall the service and food were amazing and even though it was a pricey dinner (even during RW), we appreciated how attentive the management was and how the food and ambience made our date night very intimate. Highly recommend coming here for a super fancy date night :) Can wait to come back here again!, I HATE STEAKHOUSES! Well, at least I did. After tonight, however, I a changed man. Let face it... Every steakhouse promises THE BEST food -- Ruth Chris... Mortons.. Capital grill... Prime rib... Etc. Rarely do these guys actually deliver. At least to me they don. I can never justify the obscene prices they charge. But look we all know steakhouses are a complete ripoff. And Mastros is probably the most expensive of them all. But for the first time in my life I can actually say that the price was justified. I just dropped nearly $300 on a single meal with my wife. That what some people earn in a year. of course, Normally I regret doing something like that. BJ Not with Mastros. I gladly do it all over again. this is a special event kind of place. Unless your Donald trump you are not going to eat here often. But I must say, if you want to impress someone this is the place. The interior is sheik and modern. The lighting is perfect. The music is upbeat and oddly enough, not what you usually expect at a fancier restaurant like this. In other words if you enjoy classical or jazz music with your meal you may not enjoy eating here because they eclectic top 40 tunes. The service is impeccable. It doesn get any better. Special props to our waitress tonight, Clara, for making our experience so enjoyable. The food: I had the lemon ginger cocktail which was pretty good. My wife had a killer glass of Italian Pinot. The bread was incredible!! A whole assortment of rolls and crisps to chow down on. I was getting full on the bread alone. Our appetizer was the burrata salad with heirloom tomatoes which was great but I can say Id recommend it simply because you can get something like that anywhere. For my entree I had the 12 oz filet and my wife had the 8oz portion. Both were cooked medium. These steaks were insanely good. But The sides were even better... Saut39ed mushrooms... Brussels sprouts and gnocchi!! We then capped our evening with the butter cake. I gained approximately 2 lbs after eating this meal. So If your on a diet do not come here because I can literally feel the butter and cream clogging my heart. My fingers are almost getting to fat to even type this review. But again if your looking for a divinely rich steakhouse meal I can thing of how it can get any better than Mastros., I am an occasional steaker. This establishment exceeded expectations from Clara who recited the specials effortlessly, to the seafood tower and the delectable cuts. Tying all this together was the impeccable service. A keeper!, Meh. Ive experienced better., My only piece of advice is to go to Joes instead, seriously. Everything from food, to value to ambiance is 100% better at Joes., Two words...Butter Cake.But seriously, Ive been to Mastros three times since they opened. The first of which was for one of their pre-opening parties. They literally rolled out the red carpet and guests were treated to glasses on top of glasses of champagne, along with any cocktail of your choosing. They had a tower of seafood that consisted of shrimp, crab legs, and oysters, all of which were amazing. For my birthday a group of 12 went for dinner. We had excellent service from the moment we arrived until we left. I love that they take the tag team approach where many servers assisted us so we were never left wanting for anything. I ordered the 8oz filet mignon served Oscar style. I love that their Oscar is actually a large crab cake instead of just a sauce with chunks of crab. If you go that route, I definitely recommend getting the smaller filet. All of the sides are delicious but the roasted Brussels sprouts by far were my favorite. Also the lobster bisque and spicy mambo salad are the perfect starters.If you favor cocktails, their drinks come in a shaker so know that you will have at least 2 servings. Just remember to not let it sit too long or it will become watered down.Lastly, although I was stuffed I couldnt say no to their glorious warm butter cake. Its a hefty portion so it could easily be shared by four people. If youre greedy like me just share it with one other person.Tip: Unless you want to pay a premium for water ($8/ bottle) when they ask if you want still or sparkling just say tap is fine. Our group consumed like $60 worth of bottled water. That could have been another 3 Mastros margaritas, just saying.Ive been back for Restaurant Week (an excellent deal) and a girls night out. Mastros is great for date night, a special occasion spot or just stop by the bar before starting your night. Just make sure you come dressed appropriately., My experience with Mastros goes back a few years and all the way back to California. I had my parents 50 year anniversary celebration there and it was one of the best places I have ever been. The DC location opened and I went happily to get the warm butter cake, which is out of this world! My bone in ribeye was juicy and so well cooked, it brings tears to my eyes. Wonderful service and make sure you leave room for the butter cake, highlight of anyones dinner! Beautiful setting and impeccable service., The Entree was great! The Butter Cake was off the chain! I would definitely visit again when Im in DC., Checked this place out Friday night and truly loved the atmosphere. We sat in the bar area where there is live music. There are seats at the piano, where the music man was tearing it up, and there was also an accompanying female vocalist. Service was subpar, but the bar was really crowded so I couldnt really complain too much. The steak was phenomenal! I ordered the 24oz porter house and had them cut it for me in the back to make life easier. It was my first time doing that, and boy did it make a great difference. They must have used the sharpest knife, Bc it was cut right too the bone, so I didnt have to gnaw on it to get the extra meat.The lobster mash potatoes are a must. Large chunks of lobster in creamy potato heaven. I did order the Diablo, which is a tequila specialty drink they have, but it was way too sweet and the waitress noticed I was drinking it and offered to take it back. I went with a Chimay beer instead and it hit the spot.If u feel like a chill night with great live music, wonderful atmosphere and even better steak, hit this place up!, If your looking for a restaurant to go to for a special occasion, you should try Mastros Restaurant in DC. The atmosphere is conservative and will remind you of Joes Seafood Stonecrab and Steakhouse. The servers are attentive but modest. Between the steaks, the lobster mashed potatoes, crab cakes and Brussel sprouts the highlights of the table were the Brussel sprouts and lobster mashed potatoes. Just when we were about to say the restaurant is nice but a little stoic, all of a sudden everything changed. The live music started at 6:30 and they became the highlight of the night. Jeremy and Julia were phenomenal and had a great variety of selections, playing several favorites. The entire mood and energy of the restaurant was uplifted. Definitely dine after 6:30 and you will have a great experience. While enjoying the band be sure to get the Lobster mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. #octobercelebrations#mastrosrestaurant#meandmyfavoriteladies#fallynsfoodieexcursions, Cant get classier than this place. The service is by far the best service Ive ever encountered. One of the best steak houses in the area., Fabulous meal! Wait staff is outstanding. Loved the cleanliness of the powder room. I wanted to be buck wild but it was not that kind of scene. Best food!
42|medium-rare-washington|Excellent new addition for Cleveland Park and DC.Medium Rare is a very focused, high-quality, value priced steak & frite restaurant from Mark Bucher (BGR), Brian Zipin (former Rays), Tom Gregg and Chef Cedric Maupillier (former Chef at Central Michel Richard).Went tonight on opening night to give it a try and loved it.The best thing about it is the value. For $19.50, you get a basket of really excellent, crusty, freshly baked bread, a good-sized lightly dressed salad with nice mix of greens, a generous portion of sirloin cap served with a secret sauce that clearly has beef stock and wine in it, and wonderful hand-cut and crispy frites. Then, once youre done, the come back to your table with a hand held grill pan to....offer seconds on steak and frites...at no extra charge!Theres not a lot of choice thought they do have an off-menu grilled portabella option for vegetarians. This is a place to get a great plate of tasty steak with some truly excellent frites. Nice redesign of the old Yannis space with lots of exposed brick, big sidewalk facing windows and nice bar serving a limited selection of wines and beers. The desserts are huge. We couldnt handle anymore but saw the chocolate fudge cake, lots o layer carrot cake, giant cheesecake and equally giant housemade sundae.Medium Rare is going to be very popular offering this kind of food at these prices. Definitely recommend going soon before the word really gets out., Loved it! The steak and sauce were delicious and the frites were crispy and perfectly salted. The service was good and portion sizes were great. Ill definitely be going back., Not gonna offer much new aside from what was already said below. Came to this place opening week and I was extremely impressed. Fantastic service, great prices, DELICIOUS FOOD, and generous portions. The bread and salad were both A++. And then the steak and frites! Not one, but two servings! Good lord. AWESOME. And I usually NEVER eat dessert, but I was just absolutely tempted at this place. Apple pie + vanilla ice cream = amazing. For two prix fixe steak dinners, a shared dessert and a shared bottle of wine = $100 (incl. tip) between two friends. However if you go and just get the steak/frites/bread/salad it will run you less than $30. Not bad AT ALL.I have never before been so fat and so happy. I will be sure to return many a time., Ive waiting impatiently for Medium Rare to open. If you like really good steak frites, then youre going to be very happy here. If you want a restaurant with several choices among different types of food - dont come here. This is a very specific concept based on a popular Parisian restaurant chain, and they do it very, very, very well. The salad was really good. Not over-dressed. Bread was outstanding. Very crunchy crust but not too hard. Steak was delicious and the sauce really complimented it well. Fries was also great. Nice and crisp. Great with the gravy. We split the carrot cake for dessert and it was equally good. 6 beautiful, light layers with a nice frosting. Not heavy and oily like many carrot cakes., Delirium Tremens. Amazing salad. Two courses of finely cut steak drizzled in the some heavenly gravy sauce type stuff (aka secret sauce). Double fudge chocolate layer cake. The acoustic version of Whitesnakes, Here I go again on the playlist.That all I need to say to convince you to go here.Still reading?Ok fine, Il explain some more. First off, to dine here you have to understand the simplicity of the menu. Medium Rare takes the minimalist approach. The menu is one page and reads as follows: artisan bread, a mixed green salad (with the best dressing ever) and prime sirloin cap steak served with fries and secret sauce. All for $19.50. I guess the one vegetarian option changes nightly. And then a listing of five reds, six whites and four draft beers. Luckily one of those draft beers is Delirium Tremens.They are also sneaky devilsl They ask how you would like your steak done and draw a tic tac toe on the parchment paper tablecloth and fill in the first row with your preferences, so youe wondering what the other rows are for. Then they start you off with some thick bread with a crunchy crust and salad. I could have eaten five plates of the salad along with its tangy and light dressing. And then you get a plate of steak frites and about five slivers of steak. Juicy, perfectly done steak goodness that is bathed in a sauce that was deliciousness. It a modest portion, and you think cause you paid $19 that all your getting. But oh no, a guy walks around to your table with a large pan and heaps on some more steak and fries and leaves you with a pot of the secret sauce to pour as you please all over your plate. And don forget the dessert, we split a slice of enormous chocolate cake that had divine frosting and was coated in almond slivers.To add, The atmosphere of this restaurant is very cozy and very Parisian bistro. You will be dining amongst red exposed brick walls,large inviting windows with a great street view of Cleveland Park and bistro tables. And should warmer weather ever come to dc this spring (that lying SOB of a groundhog), this place promises to have an inviting patio, much like its predecessor, Yanni. The one bad point, I did find the service very friendly, and the managers made a point of speaking to every table, but the service felt hurried and rushed that particular night, it was hard getting their attention at times.The quality and the price have now officially made Medium Rare my favorite steak place, to qoute Whitesnake anIe made up my mind, I ain wasting no more time., I was a bit nervous going to this place during the first week of operations. There are usually a lot of kinks to work out, and things could go wrong (I had read on some other sites that there were some big issues with service). I was actually amazed with how smooth everything went.Just a little bit of background.. Obviously a lot is made about the concept of bread, salad, fries, steak, sauce on steak, deserts. I think it a great concept, but of course execution needs to be on point. The concept isn new though (yelp.com/biz/le-relais-d206). Lntrecote from Paris made this concept before (and I am sure that they took it from somewhere as well), but I think every city needs a place like this. They have opened up branches in a couple of places. I want to talk about the space a bit. I thought it a beautiful spot now, and they have upgraded it tremendously from what it was before. The exposed brick walls. The lighting. The light colored wood flooring. It just works. Its an easy place to go to. First thing first. Delirium Tremens on tap. Score. I did not get a chance to go through the wine list at all to be honest, so I cannot comment if it is overpriced. But I personally think that beer is delicious, so I usually go for that.The salad was tasty. greens tossed with a light mustard vinaigrette is a great way to start any meal (and again simple, but tasty). Our artisanal bread with butter (and sea salt sprinkled on top) was standard decent fare (can go with bread and butter, but guys...please just call it bread). Of course everyone wants the steak. The steak came out at a perfect temperature (I usually like my meat medium rare). secret sauce was delicious as well. Fries were good (props to the manager, my plate came out with a smaller portion of fries, and he brought us out more which was nice). Also, before people complain that the portion is small, they come out with a tray for a second serving. So the meal is filling (somebody asked about this point, why they do the seconds option, that is how it is done at Le Entrecote I believe as well, so the crew that owns Medium Rare just basically cloned the whole operation). Desserts should be ordered as well (although the most expensive for value I think). I had the carrot cake, and it was this massive towering piece that was so delicious. My buddy had the cheesecake, which was good as well.Soundtrack as somebody mentioned was fun, but totally all over the place. I like this usually (as it suits my nature), but just felt slightly off for the space if I am to be honest. Overall for the two steaks and fries, four deliriums (8 bucks a pop), and two deserts (8 bucks each) came out to over 50 bucks a head with tip and tax. I will certainly go again. It is down the street from my apartment after all, so not that hard to get to., The food here is great the service needs some work, allow me to explain...My wife and I came to Medium Rare late on a Saturday night (I believe it is only the second Sat that they have been open) knowing what the menu was. For those who haven read the other reviews I will break it down for you. They have one thing on the menu - Steak Frites. It is $19.50 and you start with bread and a salad. They have 4 types of beer on tap, and a selection of wine.The bread they start you off with is good, the crust is very easy to get through, and tasty, it was warm and not at all tough. The salad consists of mixed greens with a few small bites of (deliciously sweet) cherry tomato. They are dressed with a house vinaigrette. The salads we had were a touch over dressed, I had to wipe my mouth when I was done with it, but I like dressing so I didn mind. It helps that the dressing is delicious.Shortly thereafter, arrives the main course. They bring out steak cooked to the temperature you choose, crispy fries, and a special sauce, which is a slightly sweet gravy. The steak is perfect. Fork tender, has good taste, really couldn be better. The fries are well cooked and well seasoned, which makes them good. They have no amazing flavor to them, so they are good, not great. The sauce is also good, it compliments both the steak and the fries. And then... They come around asking if you want seconds. This is almost inconceivable to me. Who does this??? Anyways, you get more steak, more frites, more sauce. It is more then a fair price for the amount you get, quite frankly it is a steal. They have a variety of desserts, my wife had the apple pie which she loved, it comes with ice cream that I tried and is very good. I ordered a piece of carrot cake to go (I am eating some as I write this) it is very moist, 6 layer cake with a frosting that is not too sweet, it is a good compliment. It is not greasy, as some carrot cakes are wont to be. It also has no raisins, which makes me happy.The service...The service was extremely scattered and disarrayed when we were there. I chock it up to it being the 1st or 2nd Saturday they are open, but still there were some bad oversights. The initial one would be, it took 15 minutes and I had to flag someone down for someone to take our order (Your order by the way consists of What temperature would you like?) The servers were constantly unsure of where each plate of food was going, which caused us to get seconds almost immediately after finishing our first serving, not that I am complaining about that, but a few other tables had been waiting and looked grumpy. It was unclear who our server even was, or if we had one, as about 5 different people serviced us over the course of the time we were there.tl;dr - The food is good, and an insane value, the service needs some work to make this a 5 star joint. The next time you are hankering for steak frites, I recommend checking it out., In a word: Awesome.If you are going to make one thing, do it well. And this place does it well.Steak was perfectly cut, prepared and cooked. The secret sauce is great too and really goes well with the steak and the frites. The apple pie w/ ice cream was a perfect way to end the meal. Great addition to Cleveland Park. Id expect to see franchises in the future., This is my first blush at Medium Rare in Cleveland Park.Ill be honest I have been craving steak frites since I started reading Medium Rares menu last week. The first free time I had to go to this newly opened establishment was during Sunday Brunch.What did I eat?Bloody Mary, Mixed Green Salad, Bread and Salted Butter, Sliced Steak with a mushroom sauce, Frites and Hot Fudge Sundae.Time of Day?130ish, It seemed like right after the brunch run.Where I sat?At the bar by myself.Thoughts on Food:Bloody Mary: It was spicy, a bit lite on the alcohol. It did the job but I like to be bowled over by my bloody. Im not talking about drinking Everclear. What I want is spicy, fiery tomato juice, horse radish I can see, clouds of Worcestershire and a pickled veggie.Mixed Green Salad: It had grape tomatoes and was dressed with a light oil and vinegar. It was fresh, lite and geared me up to eat.Bread: I love bread and butter. This bread was great, crusty outside, chewy inside with a nice butter with sea salt sprinkled on the top. This is the kind of bread that should be served at every dinner. Perfect.Steak: because it was brunch, I added a pouched egg. The steak was covered in a mushroom sauce. The sauce was creamy, earthy and bread worthy. The steak was pink, tender and scarfable. Frankly, I could have had 30 slices but it came with 10. Thankfully, the sauce didnt overpower. The Pouched egg described as the perfect egg was a bit over done. I like my pouched to run when I break into it and this was like a yogging. Its a soft J.Frites: Crispy, thin, and aggressively salted. On a scale of one to ten. One being Ore Ida baked and ten being Les Halles. They were a seven. I think if they were slightly thicker they would be good.Sundae: It seemed like a quart of vanilla was scooped into this dish. It was covered in fudge that was chocolatey without being too sweet. Wet nuts of the walnut variety so they were salty and sweet. There were Crunch Candy Bar balls, awesome. Whip cream and rainbow sprinkles. It was excessive and glorious but name a time when a sundae isnt glorious.The Bad:This did not happen to me but I did over hear the manager asking why some tables didnt get their salads. The frites were aggressively salted. I also heard dinner has been jam packed. i think at full service this place would be a zoo.Overall I was happy, a bit too happy. I dont know if that was all the build up or all the french comedies I have been watching. The food was spot on. I would eat here over and over and over again based on this one experience. Also, Chef came out and said I had to finish my sundae but he did it in that crazy french accent. Great addition to CP and for $20 bucks for steak frites you cannot go wrong., Ok this place is f*cking great! Yes there is only one menu choice but im sorry that doesnt matter when its perfectly cooked! Seriously even the bread was great. Oh and our server Collin was awesome, he recommended a great wine and was on top of everything the whole night. Like I will only be sitting in his section everytime I go to make sure Im not let down., Ive been twice since Medium Rare opened - the first time was on their opening night with a few friends - the second was late on a Saturday night for dessert with my parents.Food is excellent, managers/owners are very friendly and welcoming - playlist is awesome.The only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because the service is a little off. Maybe it was nerves, but on the first night our server spilled fries all over my lap when giving us our second portion - not a big deal at all, but he also got confused about who got what steak, even though its clearly written on the table. We had to swap plates after he left.Ill be back though - the food and price are too good to not make this a regular dinner spot., Cafeteria. The Food: good. Not superb, but solidly good. The Service: absolutely horrible. Servers had severe attitude problems and were running around like crazy people, which I dont understand given that it wasnt that busy, theres only one thing to order on the menu, and there were plenty of servers. We had 4 different waitstaff plus a manager come over during the course of our meal: Total chaos. The Shtick: Its not actually seconds they are offering you. They explain to you that your meal is divided into two portions so it doesnt get cold while youre eating it (some kind of BS about integrity of the meat). I had to sit for 20 minutes after finishing my first half before my second half came out and it was OVERCOOKED. They were actually surprised that I wanted the second half. Wine and alcohol is overpriced. Ambiance: Loud, hectic, intrusive and rude waiters. Not a place to go if you want to talk to the person sitting next to you. Bottom line: If you dont know how to cook a decent steak, go Medium Rare (at least its cheap-ish), but dont expect a relaxing, leisurely meal. If you do know how to cook a steak, just do it at home., Just returned from a glorious meal at M.R. ...the meat-sweats are setting in. I love the concept: simple, tasty steaks with delicious (and secret) sauce. At first, I thought that I need to be that idiot and ask for ketchup for the fries, however I was so pleased with the sauce that, instead, I wanted to ask for an empty shot-glass. Overall the service was great (though we didn get knives until the second steak was served... and they ran out of the IPA which was weird because there are only a few beers to choose from). We had a nice chat with a very friendly owner. M.R. makes a great addition to the Cleveland Park restaurant scene and I can wait to go back., Ok, Ill preface this with the fact that I lived in Paris for 6 months and am picky about my steak-frites.You get a lot of food for the price. The sauce on the steak is delicioussss... I thought the steak was tad, tad, tad overcooked...so although I ordered medium rare, I wish I wouldve order rare. Fries are good. The 3 stars is because I felt rushed. Im not in Ruby Tuesdays, I dont feel like I should feel bad for being at a place for 1.5 hours. We purchased enough food/booze etc. to justify staying that long.Given that this place is 2 blocks from my house, I will be back. Ordering my steak rare next time., I enjoyed my first visit to Medium Rare last night and am looking forward to returning with friends and/or family soon. I won go in to detail on the food because most of what I thinking has been said already, but wanted to add an additional point of view. There is a cool psychological effect of going to eat at a restaurant and not having any choices. There is none of the I should have ordered that other dish or Dang, I wish I had ordered what HE is having regret. Overall, I think this leads to a greater satisfaction following the meal. Well done, Mark Bucher and team! Medium Rare is a welcome addition to the city dining scene., Their classic dinner of steak frites is not to be missed. See original review below. But now that weve gone for their brunch, well the options (just as good) expanded. Yes, you can still have the classic steak frites or more traditional brunch fare. Add in a bloody mary or mimosa, and you have brunch.Original review: Bread, salad, steak and a bottle of beaujolais nouveau... If I had closed my eyes and if the waiters had spoken French, I would have thought I was in Paris. Perfect, simple and therefore, elegant., Service, food, and ambiance is great. My steak was cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. My boyfriend and I both happily took the seconds offered!!!, I went here towards the end of opening week and had a great time. The menu is fixed and simple. You get a salad, a steak, and some frites.The food was delicious! The salad was simple with a pleasant dressing. The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare of course). I tried the steak alone first and loved it. Then I tried it with the garlicky sauce and was impressed. Im not usually into sauces on my steak, but this one was a great compliment to the flavor of the meat. I also tried one of the desserts, a fudge layer cake. It was very good. But I recommend splitting it: its very big.The service was decent, but you could tell it was opening week, because the waitress was a little out of her element. However, the wait staff helped each other out and they were all friendly. I expect I will return to Medium Rare many times since I leave nearby, and I would recommend it to anyone that likes a good steak., Okay, people, ignore the other reviews and let me break this down for you. For dinner, would you like to have some fresh, warm rustic bread, a mixed green salad with a really nice vinaigrette and some cherry tomatoes, and two servings of sirloin cap steak with a sort of bearnaise/gravy sauce and hand-cut fries for $20? Yes/no.If no, then simple. Do not come here. It a prix fixe menu, meaning that this is your only option for dinner. Also, if you go to a restaurant with a prix fixe menu and then come complain about the lack of menu options, people will rightfully conclude that you are a bumpkin and ignoramus. It like going to a sushi restaurant and complaining nice restaurant, but what with all the raw fish? Sorry, it well-advertised what the menu is, and if prix fixe isn your cup of tea don come here.If yes, then definitely come here because every course of the meal was great and the price makes this one of the best values in D.C.Okay, there one part that difficult for some people. If you want a rare steak, order it rare not medium rare. And, if you screw it up the first time, they bring it out to you in two courses, so if your first serving was not as rare as you wanted, ask for the second serving rarer. I know it super complicated, so print my review out if it more than you can hold in your memory all at once.That it, folks., Loved this place, really. The only reason I am not giving them five stars is because the wine selection left a little to be desired (I didnt like the Malbec I ordered AT ALL, and the wine list was short, so I expected the wines to be hand-picked). The atmosphere of this place was great - loved the service, loved the decor, loved the 80s metal soundtrack playing in the restaurant. The menu was short - bread, salad, steak, fries, for an all-inclusive price of $20. Food was honestly great, and they let me order the steak rare, which was nice. This place is fun, not too pretentious, and a great deal. I highly recommend you go., Warm bread, crisp pomme frites, and a hearty steak- delicious and not too pricey., Steak was great, although I don think the sauce really improved it. I get it on the side next time.Fries were great, especially in the sauce. I got a side of mayo, and actually thought it was homemade.The only downside to my meal was the table of absolutely abhorrent Kathy Griffin soundalikes sitting near us. The restaurant certainly wasn quiet to begin with, so I don know that I love this place for a date spot. It certainly a place where horrible women feel comfortable yowling at the top of their lungs about Say Yes to the Dress., For what it is, I really liked this place. I had 2 delicious glasses of red wine with my meal. The bread was crusty and the butter soft and salted. The salad was a little drowned in vinaigrette but it was a dijon dressing, so it wasn too heavy. The steak was cooked how I wanted it. The frites were decent. They weren crispy but they weren bad at all. The sauce was delightful. I definitely enjoyed it and it complemented the steak and the frites which was awesome.The desserts... well, I was happily full before dessert and I should have just said no. I got the apple pie a la mode and the hubs got the sundae. O dear god that sundae was huge and my ice cream was the size of a softball. Not kidding. We shouldn have eaten all of both, but we did and we felt so sick. Despite this, wel go back, but wee not in any rush. It was good, but not we have to go back this second good., This is a really good decent concept and long overdue in Washington - a basic place for steak frittes. The steak is good, the price is reasonable, the fries are tasty. What not to like? Il tell you. The hostesses and the barstaff. Our waiter was great, but getting someone to take your name, to be nice about it, acting like they want your business and not being made to feel like ordering a drink at the bar while you wait is an act of war. Those are not too much to ask.To the managers/owners of Midium Rare - please remind your bar staff and hostesses that they are in the people/customer service business and to act like it.Maybe it was a one off, and Il go back and il be hoping for a smile or two and maybe even a may I help you., Wow, I am a big fan. First, they cook your steak to taste. I was concerned since the prix fixe menu and restaurant name made it seem possible that you only had the option medium rare. Ignorance on my part, but it seems they get the question a lot from the response I got... Ambiance was nice, but it was SO loud. The wood floors amplified all of the sound that is was very hard to have a conversation with a person seated across from you. The menu is simple, but done well. Steak was delicious and the sauce really brought out the flavor of the meat (brown sauce with a mushroom-y flavor). The salad and salad dressing were light and flavorful---lettuce had a buttery flavor and I liked the Dijon vinaigrette. Bread is hard to screw up, but it was tasty as well. I liked that they brought the steak out in two portions so the food stayed hot. While the frites were okay, I would have preferred a different starch side. Dessert left much to be desired, overpriced and uninspired. Dreyer ice cream for $8? The portion was huge, but I expected a nice gelato option or something on par with the dinner. We will definitely be back, but not for dessert., Although Medium Rare was a good meal, I would suggest stopping by Whole Foods, buying a great steak and cooking at home. Our waiter seemed peeved that we didnt order wine with our meal. I understand that tips can only be increased through wine and dessert at MR, but I dont appreciate being made feel cheap when Im looking at a set menu. Additionally, I agree w/ previous reviews about the assembly line service. A different waiter taking our order from those that brought each course. No time in between to take a deep breath and enjoy the nice window seats. The steak was ok and the fries were good, but I wasnt very impressed. Definitely get the steak sauce on the side! Though it was a good steak for the price, I would recommend stopping at CP Bar and Grill for a great burger and fries instead. I wont go back., I revel in good steak, bread, wine, IPAs and Belgian beer. This place delivered all.Im new to steak frite, so I cant say how this shapes up to the ideal, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.The service was lackluster, but didnt impact the overall experience. Plus, its new and it takes time., Weve been here twice and love it. My steak has been cooked to perfection and the fries have just the right amount of crunch. The wine list is small but I was able to find glasses that I enjoyed. My only complaint is that I think my food was overseasoned. The fries could use a little less salt. And I think next time Im getting the gravy on the side. They tend to drown that first serving of steak, so I wasnt able to really appreciate the meat flavor., The food here is good and so is the service. The steaks are pretty good nothing amazing but definitely above average. A great casual place to go with friends., A preset menu makes dining easy. And while the filler courses (bread and salad) are just okay, the steak in the secret sauce is really quite delicious (we grilled the waiters and he revealed mushroom, cream, beef stock, and white wine went into it, but couldnt divulge any more). Truthfully, for me this place is all about the secret sauce. Good steak, nice fries, and a great deal. But really, the reason to come back is that maddeningly delicious secret sauce...Tips:-Its crowded and there are no reservations during normal dinner hours. If you dont want to wait come on an off day and with a small party-No seating until your full party has arrived. Its like brunch rules folks-Service is slow in between courses but make sure to save room for your second serving of steak, because with it comes an entire boat of the secret sauce, Ate at Medium Rare last night. Plenty of seating at 7 (on a Thursday) but was pretty full by 8. Great bistro feel and lots of activity. The menu is pre fixed - salad, steak and fries. They call bread a course and while it is really good bread, it is not really a course. The wine list is short so I recommend bringing your own. The corkage is only $10 and they were happy to open and serve - nice.The salad was tossed with a dijon vinaigrette and was overall light and tasty. The steak and fries are served together with a dark cream sauce that is rich and flavorful. The fries are very good. Just what you expect - thin cut and slightly crispy. And though I didn use any, they offered vinegar as a topper. We were told the steak used is prime, sirloin cap so basically a high quality cheap steak. Steak is good, not great, but with the sauce, is just fine. (a parallel to Ikea meatballs and gravy). But at 20 bucks for the whole meal, it was terrific. Just don consider it an alternative to a real steak (with real steak prices).The service was good and attentive. But we did find it odd that when we asked how rare is medium rare the very friendly server said I don know anything about steak - I don eat it LOL.Given the price and the overall experience, I will definitely go again - and bring my own wine., * Bread: fresh and delish, served with salted butter* Salad: slightly over-dressed, but tender greens and a nice portion* Beef: perfectly cooked at medium-rare for me and medium for DH* Fries: not overly crisp, but well cooked. Neither saw nor asked for condiments.* Sauce: yum!$19.95 is a good deal for the meal, and serving the dinner in two portions makes it kind of fun. Our second serving of fries was better than our first, and having a second, hot portion of beef was a treat. Our server told us the total beef portion size was 10 oz.DH had a Delirium Tremens (Belgian strong pale ale) for $8 and I had an iced tea (overpriced at $3). Total bill for two, including tip and tax, was $65.We walked right for an early dinner around 5:30 p.m., and even when we walked back by around 7:45 p.m., there wasnt a wait for seating.The tables are tight and we were amused by the snooty family next to us (they informed the waitress that theyd been to similar restaurants in Paris, Geneva and NY... and then proceeded to order their meat well done. Whaaaaaatt??).Service was excellent! They have a great system of marking your order on the table paper and our drinks never ran dry. Definitely recommend for a casual dinner in Cleveland Park., My boyfriend and I snagged an impromptu seat outside two Saturday nights ago at 8:00pm or so. Server comes over and writes with a a red grease pencil on your paper tablecloth re: your order. Bread was good and crusty, served with good butter. Salad was soft butter lettuce, nice taste, fresh with good dressing and a few grape sliced tomatoes. Steak with sauce was fine--not anything special. I think I was expecting a little bit of a cooked steak crust, but it was fine. We ordered medium rare and second portion seemed more flavorful than the first. Fries were tasty and good.We had had a few drinks. Wine and beer list is not vast which is fine. However, I wish they served the wine in nicer, thinner glasses--that would have been an easy way to add a lot more to the meal. Thicker wine glasses just feel not special (read: cheap.)Service was friendly and good (I think WE had to request our drink orders...) but in no way did it feel anything like an event. Inside was bustling and VERY noisy. All in all, good...in terms of taste, value, and service...yet a bit disappointing in that I wished it had felt more special or eventful. I think the wine glasses would make a difference.We opted for dessert across the street at Ripple as that place feels more fun.3 3/4 stars., I came back a second time, and this time the meat was perfectly cooked. It helped that we asked for the sauce on the side. Also the salad dressing was less mustardy which made me happy. I had a bit left to take home and made for an excellent snack the next day. Also their bread is great and crusty., Sooo... If you are only going to do one thing, youd think you would do it well...So if you read the other reviews you know, there is one option here: Bread + Salad + 1 cut of steak. The bread was fresh and well made. A little crusty for my taste, but I still thought it was well done.The salad had a nice taste to it, but it was not a mixed greens salad as the menu advertized- it was literally just a butter leaf saled with two halved cherry tomatoes on it - nothing else. I will agree with another reviewer that is was not freshly made as the dressing was rather absorbed.So, obviously, you come for the steak. First, the cut of meat isnt a high grade from anything I tasted. My wife got rare, I got MR. As you know they serve you your steak and fries everything in 2 portions - half and half. The first portion was cooked absolutely terribly. There was no sear whatsoever to either my MR or my wifes Rare. It felt like it was baked rather than grilled or pan seared. The fries were good, but not mind-blowing.To note, I disagree with them serving the sauce on the first course of the steak, but the sauce was acceptable from a taste perspective.The SECOND batch of steak and fries was actually much worse. My wifes rare looked like it was a grey cafeteria meet. My medium rare, was actually well done, without an ounce of pink. This one actually had grill marks on it! Fries were again ok. Also - we received no additional sauce when this was brought out by a waiter who was obviously very new, but we were so fed up by that point, we just had it boxed up.A note about the service: Lackluster is the word of the day. My wife and I spent the whole time trying to understand some of the decisions they make. Despite having a huge bar area, they do not have a full bar - and focus on beer and wine. However, our excited server told us - they had Vodka! ... That was the only liquor option. If you have a liquor license, and youre running a steak and frites joint, might want to invest in a few more options since there are none on the menu.My overall opinion is that since there obviously isnt a depth of investment on the part of the management, is that they are cutting everything they can from a cost perspective and want to ride the novelty as far as they can and turn a profit. Im really not happy I contributed to that., Enjoyed the bread, salad, steak, and fries. Good deal for $20. Was initially disappointed that the steak is a sirloin cap steak (sliced very thin) and not a thick piece of sirloin as expected, it was still good. I thought the drink menu was too pricey, but they do offer a $12 corking fee to bring in your own wine. Our table shared 2 of the $8 desserts. Good, but again, a little pricey., First off, you guys hiring? Talk about easiest job in the world.  Walk over. Explain that you have no options. Deliver food. Receive tip.Medium Rare is a monument of efficiency, given that the menu is prix fixe all day, everyday.I heard a rumor that there is a brunch on Sundays where a decision has to be made at some point, and this kind of ruined it for me. I mean, dont make me THINK while I am trying to fulfill my primordial needs for sustenance. I do enough thinking during the day... this is dinner. I want to sit here as blank-minded as humanly possible.The salad: simple but awesome. The dressing is some French dijon concoction made with rainbow essence and stirred with unicorn horns. The steak is equally stellar: its a sirloin, but nice, tender, and utterly steaktastic. The sauce is also French in origin, a bordelaise or bourguinon, definitely a mother sauce, maybe a Bechamel. I actually have no idea, but it is some tasty s**t.Ill go back if I can convince my better half to try it again. You guys could help me out by perfecting your BLUE RARE for her. I know, its extreme, but BLUE RARE is not RARE. Its rarer than rare, like the rarest you can get without having tartar. Like seared sirloin. For a minute.Its a tasty dinner, and I suggest everyone and their mother goes., The good.... Steak was cooked to order and frittes were excellent. The special sauce was a nice accompanyment. I also like the second serving idea as you get what you pay for with the menu. Salad was nice and the bread was excellent. The not so good. While there was hints of great in the meal overall, for the focus and hype in the paper given to just doing one thing to perfection, I excpect that walking in the door. Not sure it delivered. I didnt sense the waitstaff were experts at all on the wine selection as fumbling through the pronuciations seemed a challenge. Just another sign of a great place, not an elite place. I hope they continue to improve. This could be a gem in the neighborhood. Id like to go back and update that I got the wow factor., Medium Rare--as the name portends, is lukewarm in its execution of a hot concept. I LOVE steak frites joints which dot the French and Belgian city landscapes. So I was super excited when I heard about MR. But, after the rave reviews--positive and negative, I wasn sure how to approach this. Frankly, I not sure it deserved either.**Service: It did not appear they knew how to serve a table of 3. The little things were consistently missed throughout the night: proper number of sliced bread, steak orders, time between bringing out courses. By the time we were ready to leave, we were tempted to start leaving just to get their attention. We had flagged down servers twice and waited 20 minutes (I was watching my watch) before we got our bill. Bread: awesome. Unfortunately, they did not bring enough for us each to have two pieces, and we had to ask for more. Salad: yellowed and mostly butter lettuce with 2-3 halved grape tomatoes. The color was off-putting but the texture was good and the flavor decent.  Frites: Traditional Euro frites not American-style steak fries. These nearly-shoestring delights were perhaps the saving grace of the meal. But when we asked for more, no dice.  Steak: ehh. The one choice we got--how we wanted it cooked, they got wrong. Way wrong. Mine (rare-med rare) was overcooked, friend 1 (med-rare) overcooked on first, fine on second, friend 2 (med): too rare both times. She and I swapped ours. The steak that was cooked correctly had good flavor but no texture.  Sauce: Reading other yelp reviews, my friends and I wondered if they took the too much sauce too much to heart as we didn have that much. It was nice, but maybe it had just lost that lovinfeelin, as we didn understand the magic surrounding it. Friend 1 said hers tasted almost gritty. I didn notice that but it seemed a pretty standard mushroom cream sauce to me.The name fit my response: I won be going back on my own, but I also wouldn put up a fuss if someone asked me to go., what was that meat we just ate? it was gray, and very gamey..why? the french fries were so salty we could not ear more than a few nor could our neighbors at the other table..we should have started with desert..hot fudge was wonderful...the salad was also beyond salty..my mother always said..when the food is salty, usually the chef is in love!!!..amour, amur guys..good idea guys, but something is very wrong with the heavy handed salter...and really, what is that cut of eat???sorry, but we really were looking foward to our new neighborhood restaurant.i have written a few cookbooks, and always give the new guy on the block a few tries, but with food like that we are very disappointed....ann and len, When this place opened, I loved the concept and value. But now theyve started serving flank steak. No thank you. If youre counting your pennies and need to be sure you can stay on a tight budget with all the constraints, enjoy. Otherwise, why eat crap like that?, Great steak, great value. We went on a Friday night, without reservations and had to wait only a few minutes at the bar for a table. The place was full, but not overcrowded. The prix fixe menu started out with a nice, light bread, followed by a simple, but well-prepared salad. The first serving of steak came out shortly thereafter. The quality of the meat was better than we had expected for $20/person, and the sauce that went with it was excellent as well. Fries were salty but still very tasty. Same for the second serving.Strongly recommend checking it out if youre in the area., Ill be quick: my steak came back as I ordered it, medium rare, the frites were wonderful, the Fitou we ordered was excellent, the salad was good, but slightly over-dressed, and the desserts (the apple pie and carrot cake) were enormous but enjoyable. And I probably should have led with this but our dinner at Medium Rare turned into an impromptu farewell dinner for two good friends from Paris who had been working as journalists in DC for the past 3 years. They declared that this was the best steak frites theyve had in the United States. Talk about burying the lede., I wasnt exactly excited about Medium Rare. The frites were cooked to order (medium rare), but the second round that came out was a little too chewy. The salad was a bit over dressed, but the dressing was pretty tasty, so I didnt mind. They serve one liquor (which is Vodka); I ordered a Cosmo, and much to my surprise was very good. Overall the experience was enjoyable. The service was quick, the waitress was friendly, and the patio is great for people watching. Next time I am in the neighborhood I may go back, but I dont see myself making a special trip., I love EVERYTHING about this place except.....I wish the fries were a tad less stale (like they had been sitting in fry station too long) and the cuts of meat on second serving not so great. I dig the bernaise? sauce.Other than that the bread the salad beer choice (Avery IPAs smoothhhhhhh) servers barkeep manager setting hott patrons gave me a very GOOD first impression. Will def. be going back.Raquel is a very attentive great pourer well tatted with China Doll porcelain skin (NO, not the beer talkin either) barkeep who works da bar very well by herself. Next gig Sticky Rice fo sho!!!!! :)The tunes crank out and Marks playlist good 80s stuff except for some N Sync and Back Street Boys. Almost got me air guitaring on Springfields Dont Talk to Strangers.....the hot bar patrons kept me from doin so.I say go 2,3 times before making any negative comments CAUSE that side of Ct. Avenue needs a keeper!!!!!!, Il start out by saying that I was somewhat excited about my first experience at Cleveland Park Medium Rare. The concept is a noble one, and it makes all the sense in the world: simple & set menu = less time bull-sh*ttinover what to order. In MY perfect world, this concept reigns supreme. But MY world doesn always jive with the real world. Il start off with the misses:(1) The salad was pre-mixed, and felt like it had been sitting in a bowl in the kitchen just waiting to be scooped into plates to be served. The salad has a lot of potential with all its simplicity: tri-color lettuce & slices of cherry tomatoes. But the wilted greens & the heavy-handed pour of vinaigrette dressing was NOT ok. Miss #1.(2) When the steak & frites made its way to our table, I was put off right away. I guess when I have a steak dinner, I expect a nice cut of meat, not already-sliced pieces of meat laid out on my plate & drenched with a liver-based gravy. It felt more roast beef than steak, and that was NOT ok. Miss #2.(3) I no food snob at all, but those frites, while tasty & crunchy, were salty and not at all what I had expected. I guess I so used to the type of frites that are served with steaks at French or Belgian spots. To MedRare credit, this is truly an American place, so I can let go of my hang-up a little easier. But still. NOT exactly ok. Miss #3.These three misses combined were enough for me to pass on any future visits.BUT -- besides these misses, there were some definite pluses:(1) Location-Location-Location! Amazing spot along Conn Ave.(2) Al Fresco dining was GREAT.(3) The main dining room definitely has an ambiance that pretty cool. IF you were to go here more so for company than food, then this place might not be so bad.(4) The service was great, too... Quick-paced servers don miss a beat, HOWEVER with a set menu in place, you can really go wrong (or so you like to hope). At any rate, smiling & accommodating servers are a plus.(5) They come back and give you seconds, which can make or break your experience: if you like it, seconds are a nice touch, but if youe not into it then it may come off as gag-inducing. For me, I didn hate the food (or the seconds), but I just wasn in love after all was said and done.We skipped dessert and/or coffee, so can speak to that.It was great to check this place out for the first time, but needless to say I don think I need to return... which is a shame, because I think nicely of Mark Bucher BGR The Burger Joint. At the end of the day, it truly is to each his own. For me, however, the experience was more Medium Eh than anything., bread and salad are great, steak was cooked perfectly. service was rushed - felt like they were ready for us to go as soon we ordered. meal vs. value is excellent- there are very few places you can get a steak for under 20$ in DC.drink selection is vast - be careful (prices are SUPER high)i will prob go back - and would recommend to others!!, I really wanted to love this place...great location, great concept, great name for a steak house. At first I was thrown by the fact that they only serve bread, salad, steak, and fries. But then I thought to myself, OK, I could use a great steak. And who doesn love fries? The bread was stale, or maybe it was meant to be rock hard? Between the two of us we only received 3 very small pieces. The salad was over dressed and contained boring lettuce (I think mine may have had a cherry tomato). All of this could have been forgiven if the steak had been good. If you serve no other option but steak, it better be a damn good steak. It wasn. It was flank steak, chewy, and covered in a very disgusting gravy sauce. The fries were ok...nothing special. I am by no means a steak snob but wow! I can believe people think this place serves a good cut of meat! It was terrible. Today, both my boyfriend and I are still paying for this meal..., I really enjoyed it! My husband was a little perplexed by the prix fixe menu, but I think it makes your life easier. The econ nerd in me went, Oh! Comparative advantage! Specialize in one thing, and do it well.For $20, you get a lot of food -- rustic bread, mixed green salad with a delicious dressing, and steak frites with an amazing gravy. They bring the steak frites in two portions, so go with a bit of room in your stomach. I could eat that gravy forever on everything...okay, maybe not, but it really tasty. There also a limited dessert menu (four total, I think). We had the apple pie a la mode for dessert, which was okay, not great. You could probably go somewhere else for dessert.Overall though, based on the main meal, I definitely recommend it and go back., 1 star for decor; I like the faux-st. germain exterior. Inside it was cozy1 star for service; unlike other reviewers, the servers were niceWorst. Steak. Ever. A friend and I went on my suggestion. If your steak is that good, why drench it with forgettable sauce? I was served. I tasted......I peeked around; everyone elses looks the same as ours....so my dish isnt any different. Friend and I are baffled. ppl are taking home seconds. do they instead all have dogs, this is Cleveland Park after all......yea, thats gotta be it. Sorry MR, no offense, but my dogs would prob pass too., It was good, but it is just steak and fries. I agree the sauce could be better or have some variety (you already know were getting steak and fries, you could offer a variety of sauces).But I went there in a mood to celebrate, and they were able to offer helpful wine recommendations., Went here for dinner tonight and it was delicious. The crunchy bread they give you to start was warm and fresh. The house salad is simple yet delicious. The steak is good and the sauce is very tasty. All in all a nice addition to the neighborhood., Apparently the people who have been rating this place well have never eaten good steak. This place was terrible. TERRIBLE. If you only offered one meal to your customers, you would want it to be the best damned meal, right? Apparently, they dont feel the same way about their steak. Why put gravy/sauce on steak? To cover up dry steak. Fries were generic. Dry steak. Bad gravy. Go here if all you care about is chic. Go just about anywhere else if you want steak. Zero stars if I could. I can honestly tell you I have not had a worse steak. Piss poor., Over dinner a few weeks back, it came out that Ie never ordered a steak at a restaurant. It not that I don like steak or anything, but I grew up with parents that char everything to a tooth-chipping crisp - mystery solved, right?. Anyway, my friends of course were appalled and suggested we try the new place in my neighborhood because we all heard good things and of course the price is right.Let me start with the pro:- I thought the steak was pretty tasty actually. Keep in mind that I new to the steak game, but still - I was happy that seconds were part of the experience. I also liked the secret sauce. Ever the cautious one, I ordered it on the side, but soon found myself pouring it all over everything, so yes - definitely a fan of the sauce.- I also thought the bread and the salad were good. Nothing out of this world amazing, but certainly better than Ie had at other places.- Oh, and not to be lame, but the sign out front is cool. I know - lame and irrelevant, but the design of it adds some much needed flair to the neighborhood, so I thought I mention it.Sadly, as much as I wanted to like this place, I do have some cons (one being HUGE) that will most likely keep me from going back...even though it literally right down the street. - Unlike my ignorance of all things steak, I do consider myself to be somewhat of a frites expert. I lived in Brussels for a while and as we all know, that city knows how to make a decent basket of frites. With that said, I was a bit disappointed with Medium Rare on this. If youe going to concentrate on two main things - in this case steak and fries - then both had better be good. I thought they were a bit stale and seemed like more of an afterthought than as a solid counterpart to the steak. - BUGS. SEVERAL of them. I feel compelled to admit that I am more bothered by insects than most people, but it still gross either way. There were three crawling on the wall next to my head and another on the floor next to my friend sitting across from me. Another friend crushed one with a table napkin. They looked like little beetle things and honestly, it really ruined the dinner. What really surprised me is how un-phased the staff was about it. I mean, they definitely apologized, but they didn seem embarrassed or overly-concerned that they had bugs crawling all over the wall. Instead, they pawned it off on the heat and amazingly said at one point, I think theye getting in up there because there an opening under the pipe as if the rationale as to how theye getting into the place made it okay that theye there in the first place. I know that insects make their way indoors sometimes, but this was too many and I thought their reaction to our obvious disgust was a bit underwhelming. Our server took a dessert off the bill which was nice, but it didn make up for how grossed out I was for the last 30 minutes of our dinner. We all downed our wine and left shortly after.Anyway - Il give Medium Rare the benefit of the doubt and say that this was most likely an isolated incident (hopefully), but I probably won be coming back. The food just wasn good enough to justify dining with so many uninvited guests, which really is too bad., Went to Cafe Deluxe near Wisconsin and Ordway the other evening and ordered their hanger steak w/ two sides - Gruyere mac n cheese and sweet potato fries for 3 dollars cheaper. The steak, although hanger, was delicious as were the sides. There was also not the gimmick/joke of making bread an actual first course. It made my meal at this joint all very laughable upon reflection.I agree with a reviewer who questioned whether some others really know what a good steak is all about. But I KNOW that the vast majority of Washingtonians understand what a good steak is., I had very high hopes, but it was disappointing. Bread and salad were both solid - really liked the mustardy vinaigrette on the salad. Good beer selection, all wines under $50/bottle. The steak was OK - but it reminded me of Ponderosa steak. No matter what temperature you order it at, it all comes out the same - between medium and medium well. I had a couple folks in my party that actually wanted medium rare steak, but despite complaining, the kitchen couldn get it right. Fries were overdone. The portions were just tiny. Oh, and the secret sauce is just peppercorn brandy, which most steakhouses have. Not special. I left hungry, and promptly had some Irish Nachos at 4 Fields, that hit the spot.  I feel like this place is going to be popular for a bit, while everyone tries to get in and give it a go. Then its not going to get the repeat business because it just not all that, so it will fade away. Sad. Very good concept, just poorly executed., Needs a lot of improvement. The idea is cool but a little too simple. Cool place, nice atmosphere. The salad is simple but had a nice dressing. The bread was bread, nothing special.The problem I had was with the presentation of steak itself. There were 4 of us, all of which ordered our steaks medium. We, instead, had 4 different types of steak brought out to us: medium rare, medium, medium well & well. One of us had to send the well done one back.My thoughts are that they need to bring the steak out dry & YOU can add the amount of sauce onto it. They put wayyy too much on it which drowned the flavor of the steak. Also, LAY OFF THE SALT ON THE FRIES. Holy cow, my tongue was burning after eating those.Plus side: desserts (apple pie & carrot cake was amazing) BUT they ship those in from other places.Until they fix some of these issues that we are all having with the restaurant, wait for the future to head to Medium Rare., Awesome. Not enough European style simple bistros in DC.Breads delicious, fries are delicious, salads good, and the steak is definitely up there. (Theres better steak at other places, but for double the cost). Some people have complained about the lack of variety. Seriously?! Thats their schtick! Youre getting salad, fries, bread, and steak frites with butter sauce. You dont like it, go somewhere else!If youre in the mood of steak and fries though, medium rare is your spot., Loved it. Very simple concept. Set menu of bread (crispy and soft in the middle just like they should be), salad (light and refreshing), then two rounds of slices of juicy steak and cruncy fries. Couldnt have asked for anything more! Well, other than the bottle of malbec and the special drunk sundae for dessert. Had Collin take care of us and we enjoyed our first time experience at this restaurant thoroughly. Went at 8pm on Saturday night and only had to wait about 5-10 mins at the bar. Definitely not our last time here. Oh and by the way, very reasonably priced. The set menu was $19.50/person, botle of malbec was $40 and drunk sundae was $10. Go and enjoy yourself. You wont be dissapointed., Good food and good service. The steak was done right and the sauce was tasty. Service was attentive. I liked the idea of serving the steak in two courses to keep it warm the seconds were even better.
43|metier-washington|Hum! I have to start by saying we loved Kinship. It was one of our favorite dining experiences in a long time because of that we ran to go to Metier as soon as it opened. It may have been too soon. The quality of ingredients used, the attention to detail of the presentation and food are all exceptional. Though we rarely do wine pairings, we selected lower priced option ($100 per) and we were pleased with their selections. Yet something seemed lacking in the overall experience. When dining at this level I believe most diners are looking for more than just amazing food, we are looking for a celebration of life and a sense of pleasure and fun. The most successful dining experiences we have had recognize that and the atmosphere reflects that. I expect that after the kinks are workout Metier will get there and there will be a more welcoming atmosphere. When we got up to leave, there was no one that asked how things were, or even noticed that we were leaving., A fantastic new restaurant by Chef Eric Ziebold that is in the lower level of the same building as the equally-spectacular Kinship. Metier is an extremely elegant and intimate setting with a seven-course tasting menu with cocktails and wine pairings available. It is quite a luxurious experience for a special occasion or well, just because. Everything my wife and I ate was eyes-rolled-in-the-back-of-your-head delicious! A real foodie experience. Treat yourself to something special -- go to Metier., Much like Kinship, Metier is just overhyped. Im so close to being completely done with tasting menus. There are still a couple of other places in DC that manage to do a decent job though, Metier is not one of them. If youre new money and wanting to tell your friends you went to the newest hyped restaurant in DC, youll love it. The ambiance and the service will likely impress you enough to make up for the poor execution. There are a couple of standout items that they do well and the amuse bouche/early courses were nice. But again, for the cost, as I said with Kinship, you better bring it. Komi, Plume, Minibar all do a much better job for comparison purposes., My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed Eric Ziebolds new restaurant. The service was outstanding, beginning with the welcome and amuse bouche in the anteroom, where we also enjoyed a cocktail. We thought all of the courses were very successful except the first of the two dessert courses (tea and shortcakes), which was simply good. My favorite course was the lamb ribeye while my wifes favorite was the halibut. The wine pairings were excellent. We enjoyed watching the kitchen during our meal and were very curious about some of the dishes being prepared for Kinship upstairs and so look forward to trying that restaurant as well., FANTASTIC!! Everything about this place and the experience was lovely... From the moment you descend on the tiny elevator that opens to the inviting parlor, to great conversation and hor durvers by the fireplace, followed by surprising architectural detail in the dining room. Most importantly, the service was impeccable and the food was inventive, flavorful, and delicious, especially with the pairing. The chef came out at the end of the night and greeted us, which is always a treat. The only qualm we had here was paying for valet ($10), couldn this somehow be rolled into the 3cber expensive meal and make the patron feel like theye getting free valet? Anyway, this was an inconsequential inconvenience and I can wait to go back here!!, Legendary!! There are far few descriptive terms that define an experience that is above excellent, but I going with Legendary. From the moment you walk into the ground floor to the elevator ride, the pre-dining room appetizer area and then (if very lucky) to the table for two at the 8x10 window into the kitchen, you will just get the beginning sense of what is ahead of you for the most memorable evening in dining history. Every aspect of your dining experience is addressed by the staff. Chef Ziebold and his wife have considered all options on how to give the customer the most professional, non-stressful and well rounded tasting experience in D.C., if not most of the United States. Each course, presented on hand-made custom serving plates, wood, etc. carefully hold the tender morsels for each course. Every service person presented each dish with a thorough explanation of how each item on the plate was created. All staff were knowledgeable in every aspect of the dining experience. The staff could each answer any question presented to them about the history of the food, the restaurant as well as their personal likes. The wine collection was superb and our selection was supported by the Sommelier with perfection. A two course dessert is not to be missed. At the end of the meal, small tokens of your experience are presented to you and in our case and constant compliments, we met the Chef to personally share our thanks.Overall cost is not for the faint at heart, but easily worth a Legendary experience. Much Thanks.
44|minibar-by-jos%C3%A9-andr%C3%A9s-washington|This is a tough restaurant to classify being that there is a large variety of foods. The minibar is inside of Cafe Atlantico in DC where they have two seatings a night for six people at a time. So if exclusivity is your thing this is the place to go. There are two chefs behind the bar that explain everything you are about to eat, drink, and spritz. Some dishes are made in your presence, others are prepared through out the day.I suggest you take a look at the images on the website to see what interesting dishes they have in store for you. The dishes themselves are foods that you most likely have never experienced before and most will be ones that you never want to experience again. The food here will bring destruction upon your taste buds and stomach from the variety and flavors. Some of the things that haunt my memories are the chocolate covered foie gras, the foie gras cappuccino (the ultimate in nasty), and beet salad. Try following those dishes up with an odd caesar salad and a creative philly cheese steak cooked by blowtorch; both decent. You stomach won be prepared! This place is definitely an interesting experience but if you are looking for a meal this isn the place. I went for pizza and beer afterwords to get back to normalcy.My friend and I refer to this dinner as the One Hundred Dollar Dinner (cost per person, at least), so be prepared to bring your wallets and then empty them.Just to summarize, the minibar is best taken in as an experience, one that youe definitely never had and one you will never forget, and not as a 5-star eatery. If youe bored with eating the same stuff all the time this place will definitely break that cycle and then put you right back into it wishing you had never left., 32 courses ! So you know that each one is a single bite (or maybe two).If you have ever been to a restaurant where the chef gives you a little bite of something at the start.. then imagine that (X 32). Amuse Bouche on steroids! (wordsmith.org/words/amus206)Really innovative food.. 6 seats. Reserve a month in advance.8:30 seating starts at 8:40 and take 2.5 hours.Food was entertaining a novel They change one menu item / month, and everyone gets the same thing.. the only thing that you can cutomize is wine.. but 3 of the Amuse Bouche are alchohol drinks.. so keep your pallet sober and save the booz for after dinner!Example:Mohito drop - which is green, served in a spoon, and looks to be the consistency and shape of an un-cooked egg yolk. When it bursts in your mouth it is amazing. Yeah, they will tell you that to make it they blend the Mohito with some type of salt then drip it through a straw into a blah-bla-blah-cellulous bath to form the drops. But you mind is saying SECONDS PLEASE! (there are no seconds.. come back next time).They use this same trick alot along with various gelatine encased food.I felt FAT leaving.. I would do this once a year max. Totally novelty meal.I might consider this as my last meal on earth because it is 32 micro-meals in one.CHEERS!, I read about this place in May, 2005 when the NY Times ran a general appreciation by R.W. Apple Jr. travel2.nytimes.com/2005206 and a formal review by Frank Bruni. I was about to get on a plane to attend a meeting in DC and phoned up Minibar to see whether they happened to have a seat available that week. They did, so I went to check out the scene.I award Minibar 5 stars because it seems to be the best in its category. I have some reservations about the general category, however, and I kept wondering during the meal how badly Alice Waters would react to it. One guiding principle of California cuisine has been to stick with simple preparations whenever possible and to let the superb ingredients speak for themselves. Here, the ingredients are top-notch, but theres plenty of manipulation going on. Once you get past that, you can sit back and enjoy the show. As they come out, the dishes elicit surprise, shock, laughter, astonishment -- well, you get the idea. Is it really possible to serve (insert your favorite savory ingredient here) as a popsicle? Well, I guess so!The bottom line is that Im very happy that there was a seat for me. Im glad that I came, and I had a good time. The chances that Id ever want to go back are exceedingly slim., 100 dollars (not including tip, tax, or wine), 32 courses (of which 2/3 are tiny drinks), reservations (they say) should be made a month to the date, but i know for a fact that if youre going by yourself it is much easier to make the reservation closer to the day you want to go to. this is really just a place you should go to for the novelty. it is not very original anymore and the best thing that was served was the olive from the spanish restaurant el bulli (where minibar comes out of). the meal was interesting, but not anywhere near satisfying. it was pretty repetitive and there were definetely things that just didnt work at all. if you arent used to shellfish or have a finicky stomach, this meal will not sit well with you., This was the first restaurant the boy and I ate at on a vacation here. We had been recommended it by my sister who ended up there during some business meeting, and a friend who briefly worked in DC.I loved it. It is absolutely bizarre. The space is very small, very intimate. The Minibar is actually literally a mini bar on the second floor of the Cafe Atlantico restaurant ; and it has only six seats. It is a prix fixe with about twenty changing courses of tastes. There are two seating a night and you should try to make reservations exactly one month to the date if you want to go there.This is not a meal for the faint of heart. I will eat anything you put in front of me, (PLEASE STAY AWAY IF YOU ARE PICKY.) but the boy had trouble with maybe one or two of the raw bites, though that is pretty good considering the courses of Cotton Candy Foie Gras, olive Oil bonbon (amazing), beet tumbleweed and pork rinds with maple (crisp, sweet, light, porky!!).By the end we were both positively glowing. It was just so amazing, so personal, so fun. Everything is made course by course in front of you. It takes several hours to go through it all. You feel so special. This place is all about the food experience. For a true culinaire, it is a can miss.Half of it is smoke and mirrors, and I like it. Make sure you dress super cute as it will make you feel all the more into it. Like I said it is an experience. I felt like a rockstar...and then we fell back into reality at our 1960 built Holiday Inn hotel accommodations! How else can we afford to eat like this? Ahh...I shall cling to the memory., OK, so this tops my list as the most expensive meal I have ever had. But it was all worth it for a foodie like me. First, you have to get a reservation. And after several failed attempts by both my friend and I, we succeeded. You have to call exactly one month in advance and if you dont manage to get through at exactly 9 am that day, youre probably not going to get it. Theres only 6 seats at Minibar and its kind of like sitting at a sushi bar with really friendly chefs explaining and guiding you through this 2 hour foodie journey. Next, the meal. It consisted of 27 mini plates, most of which are one bite plates. I wont go into details but they were each delicious and unique and amazing. Make sure to splurge on one of the wine flights because they beautifully complement the meal and despite the name, Minibar is quite generous in their proportions when it comes to wine. The service is great and even though there are two seatings per night, you really feel like they are creating and presenting these dishes especially for you as if it was the first and only time., how do you feel about eating air or fizz? well, youl get to try those interesting textures and 20-plus other small dishes at the minibar of Cafe Atlantico. follow Irene Y instructions on getting reservations and get ready for a fun, intimate, unique, and delicious dining experience. worth the wait for sure., This is a once in a lifetime meal, and it should be, because youl find yourself spending more than you probably ever have before on this food!My fiancee and I went Tuesday night and went all out, opted for the wine flights, and the check was about $380.It was worth it -- a theatrical dining experience, interesting food, and nothing was oh-so-shocking you never want to eat it again, despite what some other reviewers have said. You just have to have an open mind and taste everything, even if it looks weird. You won be disappointed.Minibar works like this -- you get 27 little bites for $120 a person. Wine pairing (four glasses) can be added for $40 a person. I would recommend the luscious and sexy pairing, that what we went with and the wines were great.On to the food. The 27 dishes are all very different, but they share one theme, they are all experimental food made by adding powders, turning things that would normally be solids into foams, gelatins, etc. and using a lot of dry ice. Think Marcel on season 2 of Top Chef. The food is all deconstructed, so what looks like a line of salmon wrapped in avocado is actually a line of tomato sorbet for Minibar guacamole, along with Fritos on top. You get the idea.Every bite was interesting, and most were quite delicious. I particularly enjoyed the caesar salad, the cheese steak and the new england clam chowder. YUM. The popcorn was also awesome.So why not 5 stars?Well, I honestly think that in DC, you can get just as high quality food and a great special dining experience without dropping $160 a person. Sure, it won be as unusual as Minibar, but the men in your life are more likely to leave another nice restaurant full. My fiancee said he was still hungry after the 27 bites.Also, the minibar is inside the regular dining room at Cafe Atlantico. The dining room was really noisy while we were there so we couldn really hear some of the chefsdescriptions of the food -- which is an important part of the dining experience.That said, I don regret eating here in the least. It something everyone that has the cash to do in D.C. should do. It something you won forget. Also, they supposedly change the dishes around regularly so I might go again a year from now just to see their new creations., After two seemingly endless waits on hold with Cafe Atlantico in late February only to wind up on the waiting lists for my target dates, I got the happy phone call last week that we had a spot at Minibar for a very belated, but well worth the wait, Valentine Day dinner. It was certainly not a place to go often, and indeed my boyfriend would probably have heart failure if I suggested it, but our 2.5 hour experience at Minibar ranks as one of my favorite to date. Although Cafe Atlantico was packed when we walked in for our 8:30 reservation, we were treated amazingly well by the Minibar server as we waited for our seating- he immediately sat us at a bar table, brought over sparkling water and mojitoes, and chatted with us about the dinner to come. When we walked up to the Minibar, the two chefs immediately kicked things off with a playful mock-caprihina cocktail made with liquid nitrogen. The dishes kept coming, and segued seamlessly from tasty appetizers to seafood dishes to desserts. The chefs, especially Ryan, were great about answering my endless questions about the techniques, ingredients, and their backgrounds. I even got some behind the scenes dish from Jose Andressuccessful last visit to Iron Chef America ;) After careful debate and of course, many glasses of wine, we decided that our favorite of the 28 courses were the olive oil bonbon, the conch fritter, the parmesan man-made egg, the amazing kobe beef cheese steak, and of course, pretty much all of the dessert selections. My only negative was the sea urchin topped with passionfruit foam, which we both agreed was pretty awful. Overall, I think that this experience is definitely worth the hefty price tag. It truly opens up your mind to a new level of culinary innovation, one that Ie read lots about but haven yet experienced beyond the much more subdued Cafe Atlantico regular menu or the occasional playful foam or air addition to a drink menu. You feel completely in the capable hands of the chefs (as well as Katsuya and Jose behind the scenes), and it is a top of the line way to try that type of eating. Even my boyfriend tried every course, despite his usual avoidance of strong cheeses and unusual seafood items. For those reasons, I kept referring to the meal as equivalent to dinner and a show- the food is equal to the experience, rather than an afterthought. So, I had this on my list of places to try since I moved to D.C. almost three years ago, and now it checked off. That doesn mean I wouldn love to go again, of course... once the sticker price shock wears off!, Every penny .... worth it.Avant Garde.... Frozen food inside hot food.....spicy surrounded by sweet....Deconstructed everything....whimsical and serious. Challenging and fun. Dragon Breath Popcorn: Kettle Corn that turns to gas inside your mouth. Intimate and expert service.Negative: some of the seafood was not as fresh as I would have liked/preferred/expected. covered by lots of creativity, Minibar is truly amazing! This is NOT an experience for those who are not open to innovative, imaginative cuisine.... However, for those who are up for the occasion - don miss this opportunity to wholly enjoy an experience that simply cannot be replicated!!!!! The minibar, as previously described, seats 6 people = two seatings per night. Personally, the folks to the left of us thoroughly enjoyed every second and every single bite - the folks to the right of us didn have any idea of the culinary magnificence that was theirs to behold!!!!The staff is wonderful - unintrusive, yet attentive....The chefs (we had two fabulous fellows) are friendly, informative and terrifically enthusiastic about what they do! The best tastings were the New England Clam Chowder and the corn on the cob; the wine flights are beautifully suited to the meal and at the end - No One was hungry (quite the contrary) Truthfully, there wasn anything that wasn thoroughly satisfying in every sense....My hat goes off to Jose Andres and his staff!!!! I will return to minibar - it is worth every single penny!, Mini bar is not a place where you go to have a meal. It is to experience the form of ART through food. The dishes were pretty cool... It like Picasso and Dali paintings, just in edible form. Who would have thought to combine eel and cotton candy?!?!?!? The presentation was wonderful... service was good, except they were out of Cristom wine we ordered. (Which is understandable, btw, b/c it does happen...but at MiniBar/Cafe Atlantico???? -- NOT ACCEPTABLE) So, why only 3 stars? Some of the dishes were NOT GOOD(minues one star). The candy, olive oil... was absolutely nasty. It was like eating a spoonful of just olive oil--Why? The other reason is b/c they used some of the ingredients repetitiously--ex: baby cilantro, foam....thus minus one star. When you charge your client $100+ I don want to see baby cilantro and foam on every other dish. Think of different garnish, please., 28 courses of excitement, a procession of plates if you will. minibar is more of an experience, no an adventure than a meal. I recommend it for any foodie, chemist or person who;s curiosity often gets the better of them. You will not be disapointed, the hardest part is getting in, with a limit of 12 people seated per night you need to have lady luck on your side. Since the menu changes I recommend going once or twice a year and you should be set., The boyfriend and I went this past Wednesday night because I KNEW he hadn experienced anything like minibar before.Some of the items on the menu were the same, some different from the last--and first--time I went (new chef Brad Lee--working with minibar regular Michael Turner--a NYC transplant who did some time at Le Cirque, told me that they are constantly evolving the menu). Il list the ones that blew my mind:Sangria. WOW. I don even like sangria! But the first little opener of the night was amazing. Sangria-y and slushy, there was a watermelon, sangria-infused ice cube keeping the drink chilly as you sipped (and to indulge in when you were done).Dragon breath popcorn. Curry-flavored popcorn fused together with a blast of liquid nitrogen, you popped this into your mouth and the chefs instruct you to breathe through your nose. Pretty hilarious--everyone was snorting out smoke.Cotton candy eel. Damn good and shockingly so. The sancho pepper sprinkled on top really made it memorable!Green almonds with raisins and almond milk.The raisins were dew drops of wine, sealed with a skin they make in true minibar (a.k.a. science fair) fashion. Drool-inducing.The yogurt and honey dessert (Il get the names right when I remember to bring in the menu). This was Greek yogurt that had been drained, frozen and then blasted with LN into a fine powder, with a similarly made form of honey powder on top. Imagine eating feathers crossed with snow and silk in super-tiny flecks--seriously it was probably one of the best things Ie ever put in my mouth.I glad they kept the mojito, curried chicken wing and cigala on the menu. And they were great about the bf nut allergy--extremely careful, mindful and thoughtful, I was a bit jealous I couldn try his substitutes for when we had nut dishes (though one I had last time--sun dried tomato salad).We also did the Luscious and Sexy wine pairing. The Dr. Loosen reisling was onetime, as well as the Catena chardonnay. I not a huge wine buff, but the bf is a pinot noir nazi, and he is even dying to get hold of these bottles. Wee going hunting this weekend.Brad Lee told me that the plan is to eventually turn the whole top floor into minibar, but went pretty mum after I asked too many questions. They autographed our menus at the end--a nice, cocky touch, but a warranted one. These boys cook their asses off., WOW! That all I have to say... (Well, not really) but WOW.First of all, you have to realize that you don go to MiniBar just to have dinner. You are going to experience food as an artform. It is truly Foodie Heaven!The attention you get from your server and the two chefs behind the bar is truly outstanding. I can be slightly picky when it comes to food (i.e. I HATE tomatoes), but I decided to go in with a total open mind and it was worth it! I highly recommend doing the same if you have any finickiness regarding certain foods.My friends and I did the champagne flight with during our experience and it was amazing. Some highlights - from what I can remember - it all seems to be an amazing blur of deliciousness to me right now... The Steak and Cheese - not your typical steak and cheese, obvi, but it was yum. The Minibar version of guacamole which includes a TOMATO sorbet (which I LOVED!) was amazing. With 28 courses there are too many to remember, but the experience as a whole is really unforgettable.If you can make the splurge - because it ain cheap! - I highly recommend checking this out for the experience of it. It is amazing!, This restaurant was worth the wait. This was the hardest reservation ive ever gotten, but it was the most fun dining experience ever. I think our menu consisted of 29 courses, and the dialogue from the chefs made ithis a great overall experience. The atmosphere wasnt as serious as the other top restaurants Ive been to, but that added to the experience. The dragon popcorn and the olive oil were memorable. Ill definitely be back in 6 months to see what other interesting creations they can conjure up., Minibar was a circus of food in my mouth. I don know how I managed to get the reservation quick and easy on my first try without being put on hold for February 15th (I aimed for the 14th but they mentioned they wouldn be doing a Minibar on the 14th so we took the 15th). However, the time we were assigned was 6pm (2 of us). What was I going to say, Um, that won work for us? No of course not, so we happily took the 6pm.We did the wine pairings plus champagne and that was definitely an overdose of alcohol (seemed like such a great decision at the time). Brad and Ryan behind the bar were spectacular. The service was top notch. I like that they would tell you we recommend you eat this in three bites so then we try to rebel and do it in 2. They did this through the course of the meal - recommending one bite for anything meant to be savored in one shot. (Side note - the next day at Chipotle for lunch I thought - I wonder how many bites Brad and Ryan would recommend eating this burrito).My favorites were:From the munchies - olive oil bon bon - the best tasting olive oil burst in my mouth and the dragon breath popcorn.From the flavors & textures - the salmon-pineapple ravioli with crispy quinoa and the philly cheeseteak was genius.From the dessert - the fizzy ball was superb.Overall, my experience at this food museum consuming this food art was amazing. If you liked Minibar, I recommend restaurant 2941 in Falls Church., This is a restaurant for foodies who have seen it all, done it all and eaten it all... worth the wait, worth the price. Without a doubt one of the coolest culinary experiences of my life. Our chef was Brad... it was fun to watch him and he has the most amazing watch!!!!!!, I think I should give this an extra star just for the mojito at the bar before dinner - but that is cafe atlantico not minibar. My recommendation is definitely get a mojito before dinner!!!!! Even if dining elsewhere, I plan on going back just for a pre- or post-dinner drink for sure.Well, onto minibar. Why did I give just 3 stars? Everyone else seems to rave about the experience, right?I thought the food was fun and exciting and I found it amazing that they could put so much flavor into one or two bites of food. The corn (baby corn served with a slew of other corn tastes) was only 2 bites but my mouth was fooled into thinking I had had a whole corn on the cob, slathered with butter and salted and seasoned to taste. You really can explain it, you have to have it. So top marks for the food, Jose Andres is a genius. (Other favorites - olive oil bon bon, dragons breath popcorn, cornbread, boneless chicken wing)It was the service that I found lacking:- The bartender (again at Atlantico, not minibar) only wanted to speak in french to his weird buddy not serve me a drink.- Gabrielle, the waitress, was extremely pleasant and the only bright spot to the service.-The chef sucked! Isn that a main point of this? Dinner as theater, watching and interacting with the chefs? There were two and this guy was directly in front of us and was the only one we interacted with - brown hair I think it was Ryan). I know they have a tough job, its a lot of effort to cook 27 plates that quickly, but he seemed pissed off whenever I asked a question. I mean get used to it, the whole point of this menu is to get you excited and asking questions! For example, they presented the breaded cigala with sea salad. I have never heard of cigala so I asked him what it was and he spelled it out slowly for me C-I-G-A-L-A like I was retarded. I told him I heard it but didn know what that was, he then replied in a condescending tone - its seafood, in the lobster family. That took a lot of the fun out of it. I don want to sound bitter, but this kind of thing happened the whole night.... so anyway, fantastic food, fun idea, but service was poorly executed. At that price service should be key. I would still recommend going as it is an experience but try to sit in front of the chef with the red hair, he seemed much cooler!, Minibar challenges your perception of food, and this alone puts it in a category rare but to a few restaurants around the world. Many, if not most, of the dishes are excellent tasting, and those that are just tasty still have that crazy creativity pushing them forward. To appreciate many of the dishes, just ask how it was done. The chefs gladly share techniques - not that I have liquid nitrogen laying around anyway. True foodies, accomplished home chefs, the scientifically minded, and those in search of food fun should check it out. Not perfect, but very interesting and worth the reasonable price., This is a humbling experience to anyone who thinks they have eaten everything. The time and skill required by the chefs here shows an amazing level of passion for their work. Pictures and reviews will never do this experience justice. You would really think they would comp parking for Minibar partrons though, they go to such great lengths to make it an experience. I thought that was funny but still worth all 5 stars. Calling everyday for over month to get reservations only to get a call saying I got the nod for the first day I calleds wait list, which happened to be our first wedding anniversary and worked perfectly, still a five star experience., Minibar is dinner as entertainment, and it is an amazing thing to watch. The food itself is outstanding, as long as you dont mind avant garde cooking and are open to eating anything put in front of you. I was particularly a fan of the dishes that really focused on vegetables (e.g. the beet tumbleweed, creamed corn). It is easy to forget just how delicious a vegetable is when you rely so much on the artificially ripened stuff in your local Safeway or Giant, but these guys really make the flavors pop.As much as I enjoyed the food, the best part of the meal was watching the chefs. The experience is really interactive, you can chat with them the whole time and ask as many questions as you want. The chefs are truly artists, and watching them work was amazing (and you get to eat all the stuff they make, which sure beats going to glass-blowing studio or pretty much any other artist)., My meal at minibar was fabulous in so many ways. It fully lived up to my expectations based on what I read, by other Yelp reviewers, by the Washington Post restaurant reviewer, and from the restaurant own web site. To begin with, I was very impressed by the welcome that minibar diners receive when they arrive. Since this is a very difficult reservation to obtain, they could cope an attitude like, Hey. Youe lucky to be here. Instead, the attitude is, Hey, we are so happy to have you, and we can wait to share this dining experience with you! I found it to be very welcoming and put me in a very comfortable mood from the start.The friendly, enthusiastic, and intense mood continues when you take your seat at the counter and meet your chefs for the evening. They are astounding cooks, to be sure. But they also are great entertainers.As for the food - Wow! It amazingly fresh and flavorful. The preparation techniques are astounding. And when you get 27 items over the course of 2 hours, it sometimes hard to keep them all straight in your mind.So here are a few of my highlights. I loved the cornbread, which was one of the first items. The steamed brioche with caviar was reminiscent of Chinese dim sum. Ie never eaten eel before, and I not sure if I ever order it if I saw it on the menu. But the cotton candy eel was truly memorable. Zucchini in textures was great; as I savored it, it really illustrated how you can take a simple ingredient like zucchini and display the variety of ways it can be used in a single dish. The sun-dried tomato salad, which featured yogurt balls instead of mozzarella was the prettiest dish of the evening. I liked the sea urchin ceviche, and the avant garde Philly cheesesteak sandwich was great.In the lineup of desserts and sweets, I liked the sores, but I think the bacon and chocolate finale was my favorite. OK, so despite all of that, I still only give minibar 4 starts. Two reasons. First is cost/value. It expensive. I loved the experience. I love to try it again someday. But if that ever happens, I hope someone else is picking up the tab. The second reason - sensory overload. I mean honestly - 27 items. You can keep them all straight. I took pictures of many of them. But that was distracting from enjoying the meal. They gave us a souvenir menu. But even with that in front of me as I write this, I can remember details about everything I ate that evening.I loved it. I recommend it. It not just a meal, it an experience. Be prepared to pay for it., Sure you have to make reservations 30 days in advance & costs $120 to sit-down, but this is America. Youre allowed to throw money around & not care. This place is as good as it gets. Balls to those who think otherwise. The hostess was pretty hot, too. Boob., Awesome. Unlike anything else! I just hope you have unlimited minutes and an AMEX black card., I would have to agree with most of the people here and say this is an experience to have once at least. ORDER WATER NOT WINEFrom the beginning, as the other reviewer said, the hostess and the waiter welcomed us warmly. The waiter found us at the bar and discussed the wine with us. The chef were friendly and of course the food was amazing. We had 28 bite-size dishes and I was lukewarm on 2 of them which is a great percentage. Why 4 stars? The wine. First, the waiter really pushed the wine from the beginning. He came to the bar and discussed the flights of wine and options as if it was assumed we would have wine with the meal. Although we did order wine, I really felt that with all the flavors going on, water was the best option. My husband prefers red and the waiter suggested one for $40 a 1/2 bottle, that is the least expensive. They were out so his next suggestion was an $80 1/2 bottle. We went with a glass of Syrah for $12; however, it was awful. I have found better Syrah at the grocery store. Then for me - he suggested a $50 1/2 bottle of white - I thought it was too heavy for the meal, it was a strong apple taste and I got a headache pretty quickly and switched to water. I actually asked him to stop refilling my glass. The Magic Mojito described as a Deconstructed Cotton Candy Mojito was fantastic. It was light and smooth and personally better than the wine. I could have drank 4 of those for the cost of the 1/2 bottle. With the meal at $120 per person and then tax, tip and wine - we walked out with a $350 bill. I appreciate the quality of the meal, but for $350 - I would think the restaurant should work on their wines. MY advice - drink water with the meal - you will taste all the flavors without distractions., Definitely something to try at least once when you come to DC! You wont get a similar experience anywhere else., Ill keep this one short because it has all been said already. This is a dinner that should be experienced by all who consider themselves foodies. It truly is theater and as much about the interactions with the chefs as it is about the food. I dont know that I would go back, but I would recommend it to anyone that can afford it and loves food. Dont expect the 25-30 courses to leave you full, but expect to be wowed by several of them, challenged by several of them, and dumbfounded by many of them.Our experience was doubly interesting as we found out halfway through the meal that the single diner to our left was actually married to one of the chefs. It was interesting to get her take on his passion for food and what led him to minibar. Ok so this isnt that short. My goal was to speak globally and leave the details of the actual courses out because quite frankly part of the experience is being surprised. It was a great night out., This was the most fun Ie ever had with a meal. Only 6 diners at a time + 3 creative chefs + 27 amazing courses = one of a kind experience at minibar. The food is innovative, whimsical, thoughtful, and most importantly, DELICOUS! Jos39 Andr39s is the creative brain behind minibar (he trained under the genius Ferran Adri30 at El Bulli) and has introduced a whole new way to experience food in the U.S. He shows us that food can be entertaining, surprising, and tasty...all in the same bite. I was wowed by the array of bold flavors and textures, and loved the interactive experience with the chefs. The portion sizes were also just right - I left feeling satisfied but not overly stuffed. TIP: It impossible to pair wine with so many courses, but the Dr. Loosen 2006 German riesling paired well with just about every dish.With 27 courses, I going to list some of the highlights. For a pics and a detailed review of each course, go to my personal blog (link under my profile).STEAMED BRIOCHE BUN IN CAVIAR - absolutely divine! This was a million times better than a blini...the fluffy bun was filled with cr38me fra3eche and then topped with osetra caviar and lemon foam. The bun was like Chinese buns, only a lot lighter, less starchy, and much more sophisticated. COTTON CANDY EEL - brilliant presentation. I loved this dish! Unagi (sweet bbq eel) was wrapped in shiso leaf, then cocooned in a peppery cotton candy...it looked like a butterfly was about to emerge. The cotton candy ethereal texture crunched and melted in my mouth, while enhancing the sweetness of warm unagi with each bite. This dish was an evolution of their popular oie gras cotton candy which I wish I could have had as well...hopefully itl be back on their menu during my next visit. DRAGON BREATH POPCORN - so fun to watch others eat... as you bite into it and breath, steam comes out of your mouth and nose! The frozen popcorn had a hint of curry while also tasting slightly sweet like kettle corn. ZUCCHINI IN TEXTURES - I usually dislike zucchini, but really enjoyed this dish. There were many layers of varying tastes and textures, while still maintaining the essence of zucchini throughout each part...cool zucchini gelee, soft tapioca-like zucchini seeds, and velvety, savory zucchini mousse at the bottom. This dish was both refreshing and rich at the same time. GUACAMOLE - cold, spicy tomato sorbet, wrapped in creamy slivers of avocado, topped with salty pieces of crunchy tortilla chips, on a pool of lime juice...this was a Mexican fiesta in my mouth! The bold flavors and textures were incredible. And yes, it *did* taste like guacamole. CORN WITH HUITLACOCHE - a recreation of baby corn...or as they put it, they were playing God with this dish. Finely ground pieces of baby corn wrapped around gelatin husk. I forget the actual ratio, but they used over 100 baby corn to make just a few of these corn creations. This dish truly captured the essence of corn - the baby corn tasted like delicately roasted corn, the bed of yellow sauce was like a creamy and sweet corn pudding, and the black huitlacoche sauce (made from a fungus that grows on corn, also known as the Mexican corn truffle) added a complex, earthy element...so many different layers and flavors unfolded with each bite. It was sophisticated while also evoking the rustic, outdoors at the same time. PARMESAN EGG WITH MIGAS - an egg within an egg. They created a parmesan olk and then put a quail egg yolk inside of it. Once broken, the yolks had that perfectly runny consistency. It was obscenely good when mixed with the thin wafers of fried bread and black truffle shavings...salty, earthy, gooey, cheesy deliciousness! This dish still makes my mouth water when I think of it. NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER - deconstructed chowder...a layer of potato puree on bottom, then a layer of sweet caramelized onion paste, then whipped bacon cream, chive oil, and finally a bit of clam foam. Then it topped off with fresh clams and a sprinkle of bacon. Eaten all together, it was the best of clam chowder blanketing my taste buds...warm, rich, hearty and the whole clams were so sweet and succulent. Each spoonful brought out different flavors and textures. THAI DESSERT - this dish blew my mind! Not only was it one of the most interesting and unique things Ie had in a long time, it tasted magnificent. This dessert consisted of coconut milk ice cream, frozen peanut powder, and lemongrass-tamarind gelee - together, it tasted exactly like pad thai but with completely different textures. It may sound strange, but tasted sooooo good. The flavors worked as a dessert because the peanut sauce in traditional pad is somewhat sweet from the peanut sauce. The coconut milk ice cream was luscious and rich, and there was a bit of heat from the cayenne that tantalized my taste buds. This meal kept me thinking and talking about it for days! WHAT AN EXPERIENCE!, I am not going to go through every little detail, since most people have covered them but a few comments.1. It is really, extremely difficult to get a reservation, however keep trying, it is worth it.2. The food is really just incredible, I am not sure why people say it doesnt fill you up, as I left there full, and I tend to eat a lot.3. Too much seafood, reason for 4 star rating. I would have preferred to see a little more beef, chicken, veal etc. on the menu.4. Chefs were extremely friendly, informative, and really charismatic. 5.The waitress was over the top, greeting us upon arrival, and helping me choose a wine. When I chose a wine sampler consisting of 5 wines, she brought out two wines I did not particularly care for. Instead of just bringing me the next wine she offered to replace it with a wine I did prefer from earlier in the night.6. It is however very expensive, between the wine flights, dinner, and a bottle of water, the total with tip came to $220 for just myself. Including my friend we were up around $500. If it was New York or LA, the price might be a little easier to swallow.Overall, I would go back if it wasnt so difficult to get a reservation, kind of like a once a year kind of deal., This was easily the most interesting meal I have ever had. My only gripe was that I needed to grill up a steak when I got home. 25+ golfball or small courses just arent that filling. The courses are all extremely creative and delicious. There was only one that I didnt care for. I wish the menu would change more so that I could justify the $125 pre-fixe menu another time. As a money saving tip, share a wine pairing rather than getting two. My wife and I did that and we found the pours to be much more than half what other diners were getting on their own.Enjoy, its an experience., Went here last year and loved it. The food is just ok but the experience is to die for. If you can book the whole table and have fun that is probably the way to go, but we got really lucky with the other guests the night we went. The chefs are great to talk to too., Stop taking notes and put away your cameras. This is one meal where you want to sit back, enjoy yourself, and be wowed by the chefs. minibar by Jose Andres is not a meal but a dog-and-pony dining experience. The notion of a 28-course meal might sound overwhelming but it ends up being a closer to a 28-bite dinner. Some might complain about the lack of food (recall the MasterCard commercial) but minibar isnt as concerned about quantity as it is about novelty. In fact, I ate a light meal (bread and salad) before coming to minibar because I didnt want to ruin my actual experience ravaged by hunger. The minibar experience breaks down to three types of ideas: foods that use new or unusual ingredients (e.g. kumquats and fried quinoa), food that focuses on novel textures (e.g. anything deconstructed or bathed in liquid nitrogen), and food thats fresh and simple. Although mini bar is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences - meaning that one visit is sufficient - I highly recommend that you make your reservations as soon as possible because this is one DC restaurant experience you dont want to miss. Original Visit: Fall 2009, So much fun!Chefs presenting the food were engaging and even encouraged us to ask questions while they were plating. Black Garlic?? What that and where does it come from?This evening we had three Chefs (Ryan, Brad & Jorge) preparing and plating for us.Execution of the plates was well timed and the chefs worked flawlessly with each other.I wont go into the crazy food details, as many other yelpers have helpfully done so, but I will definitely recommend --- ASK THE CHEFS QUESTIONS!!!! They welcome engaged diners and it makes for a more fun tasting groupAlso-- if you are looking for an all around easy to drink white that complements most of the dishes, pick out a bottle of the Txakoli.BTW--- is it just me or could Jose Andreas be the voice for Strong Bad?, Andres is a DC treasure (soon to be national) and seems to create some the most inventive meals in the city.As others have noted, 120 per person is less than other molecular gastronomy places, and with three chefs, 27 courses, and the attention and care noted, this promises a delight.Enjoy enjoy enjoy!, Reading the other reviews, it hard to come up with something new and creative to say here. :) I second every version of fun! creative! memorable! worth the price! (I also second the comment about skipping the magic mojito - go for the passion fruit martini instead!)I can honestly say I have never had more fun eating dinner out in my life, and I consider myself a very experimental/experience-driven diner. I ate and LOVED things I never would have thought to consider... same goes for my companions. We went as a group of four and it hard to decide who enjoyed the night the most!Pretty amusing when all you can say is Oh my god that was SO good 27 times in a row. From the Ferraro Rocher, to the Bagel & Lox, Philly Cheesesteak (I think I ruined now - no more trips to Philly), and Popcorn - every time you think they can top the last course, they do!Sitting near the chefs and watching as well as being able to ask questions definitely enhanced the experience. Nate and Jorge kept us laughing and didn seem put off by any question we may ask (as the night and the drinks progressed). Overall - I would seriously question the taste and open-mindedness of anyone who did not rate this place 5 stars. We give it 100 stars if we could., Started with a Passionfruit martini while I waited. It was simply delightful.This was a real splurge for us but so worth it. Every course was a different experience, I tried everything and liked it all for different reasons. Watching each dish in preparation was so neat, finding out how it was made was really cool and being able to interact the whole time with the chefs really iced the cake on this wonderful meal. Try everything they bring. Otherwise it simply isnt worth going. They check your allergies ahead of time and knew when I arrived what I couldnt have.Definitly great for a special occasion., Eaten here thrice over the past three years. Il leave the superlatives to everyone else but theye all true. One of the most unique dining experiences in America--and increasingly one being imitated with the boom in chef tables and molecular gastronomy. Now, for some actual criticism:My biggest caution is that the menu doesn really turn over that much, so I wouldn recommend more than one visit in a year. Also, I have to say that the price has risen to the point where it no longer a great value and each time wee gotten a harder up-sell on cocktails and wine. And don expect to leave full, I say mostly-sated is a better description. I not someone used to Cheesecake Factory portions or anything but I still crushed a postprandial cupcake last time.Of course, after my first minibar meal I didn have any of these complaints so I highly recommend anyone try it at least once. But in my mind, a five-star restaurant is one where you can eat once a month and still be blown away.Lastly, theye apparently moving Cafe Atlantico elsewhere and turning the entire space into a super-sized minibar, so if you want to try the current incarnation I recommend you start calling for a reservation., 7/24/10: If you can get 6 friends together its the only way you can add even more fun to the perfection that is minibar. I think everything has been said already in the many reviews for this culinary journey of a meal but stay on top of the phone reservations and eventually you will get through.2/4/12: Go ahead - get the $500 TFGroup giftcard. Make sure you tape it on the fridge to remind yourself you need to go to experience this dining event - the meal is like watching Alice in Wonderland and people will want to hear about it endlessly after you are done. Only sad thing is that once you do it once you feel like the surprise isn as good the next time around (but still worth it - just be sure to bring at least one Minibar virgin with you) - we have gone twice and will be tackling 39 in Vegas in a month, we will see how it compares and update accordingly., 3.5 StarsI echo all the previous yelpers and their love of the unique creations at the Minibar, they are amazing. However, it is more of an experience and less of a meal.First off, because it is an actual mini bar on the 3rd floor of Cafe Atlantico the chefs are not zoned to use gas, which makes serving hot courses not possible. Most of the bites are inventive, but not filling. Il let the more long winded reviewers tell you about the olive oil olive, the popcorn dragons breath, and the Steak and cheese brioche; but I will say they were all entirely unique but left my 6, 200 lb self wanting more. We hit up Bens chilli bowl late night.The food was exquisite but I had starved myself all day in anticipation of a 27 course feast, it was not that. Because each course is one olive or a few kernels of popcorn, i was ready to grab the waitress and order a pork chop from downstairs. What I would recommend, to those of us who love Komi just as much as a 32 oz rib eye at Bobby Vans, is to eat a big late lunch. Then come to Minibar with 7 of your closests friends, ready to be dazzled by the creations of Jose Andres, Wow! This is by far one of the best gastronomic experiences I have ever had! Went with my fiance, who had to make reservations one month ahead as they can only seat 6 at one time at the bar area. The food was to die for and consisted of 26 bite size items; some of our favorites included: olive oil bon bons, beet tumbleweed, zucchini in textures and strawberries with cream and sun-dried tomatoes. The best part is that it is super interactive--you not only watch the chefs prepare each dish but can ask them questions about how certain items are made, what was their inspiration etc. The concept/style of Minibar is unique, I think Alinea is the only other place I know in the US that shares the same concept. A must try for foodies! I cannot rave enough about it!, Minibar is a once-in-a-lifetime experience--perhaps literally, considering the difficulty of getting a reservation at this six-seater. The ability to ask the chefs questions and look at/smell/feel/taste a plethora of astoundingly delicious and creative--we had 30!--courses is beyond memorable., 4.5 stars.My wife surprised me with a visit for my 30th birthday, and we went with 2 of our friends. Minibar is really much more of an experience than a meal. It is watching the chefs craft everything, being able to talk to them about what they are doing, and feasting on 30+ different courses that makes this place so unique. About 2 months prior to our visit we had gone to Citronelle, and though it was typical high-end fare, with delicious food, the experience there was pretty meh. Not so at minibar.Here, the food was all very good, with maybe 1/3 of the things being absolutely brilliant. But the flow, the constant playfulness -- thats what makes minibar great. (As a scientist, I must say I got a real kick out of some of the stuff they were doing -- liquid nitrogen? straight out of the lab! ) It was simply all very innovative, tasty, and FUN. Now for the caveats:First, you dont really get that much food ; like I said, this is an EXPERIENCE, and if you expect to eat like a pig, go somewhere else. Not that I left hungry - not at all - but I was also not stuffed. So dont freak out about the number of servings; you wont be stuffed by the time the desserts start. Second, the reason I say 4.5 stars: I love drinking wine with dinner, and though I am no connoisseur, Ive had enough pairings to at least know what I like, and the pairing here was to me very nonsensical. I suspect it was because the food was so diverse that it would have been difficult to pair appropriately. Perhaps get a single bottle of something you like that will go well with most things and leave it at that. Or perhaps I just dont know what Im talking about. In any case, the wine pairing was the only negative of the meal.That said, I will easily put Minibar in my top-5 lifetime dining experiences. It was a veritable tour de force, and much more entertaining and fun than the typical fine dining experience. And at 110$ a person, it was actually quite a deal -- I mean, many concerts cost this much and this was WAY more entertaining.And their playfulness even extends to their reservation policy (ha!) -- you have to call EXACTLY a month in advance, starting at 9 AM. There are 2 x 6 seatings per night, so you better have your redial button ready if you want a specific date . . . but trust me, its WELL worth it., After eating at table 21 at volt I really wanted to try minibar thinking it would be similar. But its a completely different. It was a truly wonderful and unique experience. All the dishes were prepared to perfection and the chefs were very nice. I would definitely recommend this for a special occasion. Though you will not be very full after the meal, my bf said he needed double the courses!, This dining experience would be awesome to try if I could actually get in! Damn you Anderson Cooper!!! Seriously - I tried calling this place multiple days in a row at 10am, before 10am, after 10am, you name it. Could not get through. Constant busy signal. Once or twice, I got a ringtone, but went straight to voicemail. Then I considered sending an envoy to make my reservation since I was on the west coast. But they dont take in-person reservations for Minibar. Then had my concierge service call several days in a row and they could only get me waitlisted. Never experienced this type of demand before, although I think I am pretty good at the 30 days ahead reservation thing considering I did it with Babbo in NYC and got in no problem. Must be the 6 seat thing. Me thinks Minibar needs to come up with a better option for taking reservations since the demand is clearly out of this world, and there are, after all, only 6 seats., We went here for my boyfriends birthday this past spring. It took me about two weeks to make the reservations (partially because I forgot on a few different days to call) but it was actually kind of exciting, and the person making the reservations was very nice and friendly, after just a couple calls she actually remembered me and encouraged me to keep calling. When I finally made my reservation they were very good about asking about any allergies or other issues (religious, as well as if we were vegetarians, etc).We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and they had us wait at the bar area, where they presented the wine and drinks menu in case we wanted to partake. At 6:30 us and the other two couples were lead upstairs and sat. Once there the show started. We were first presented with margaritas with salt foam, and from there the dishes only got more interesting, delicious, and exciting. The chefs were very engaging, happy to provide advice on eating the food, as well as information on how everything was made. My favorite dish was their take on a cheese steak, including a puffed pita like bread filled with a whipped cheese and topped with thinly sliced steak which they used a small torch to heat up. The cotton candy wrapped eel was quite interesting, but surprisingly good. A lot of the food is things that you would eat elsewhere but completely re-imagined, such as bagel and lox. It included a cone that was the bagel, filled with a whipped cream cheese and topped with caviar. Other items were just focusing on one ingredient, like zucchini which included zucchini separated into its parts. The experience was amazing, highly entertaining and a great idea for a special occasion. I am very happy we were able to go., Incredible experience. Ive been 3 times now and each time its unique. A foodies delight. Highly recommended for anyone wanting a once in a decade experience. Very creative the way they deconstruct dishes. Probably my favorite part is the intimacy of the experience. You can converse with the chefs and it truly becomes an educational experience. Delightful insight into a chefs world. Impeccable service. Try the wine flights!, Really amazing experience. Food was off the hook and service was also top notch. Only down side is that we spent a good chunk of change and left hungry. Minibar = mini plates. Still I dont mind spending good money for good food and this certainly qualifies., Honestly, meh. For a $600 bill, I expect something pretty great. Everything at Minibar was indeed good, but nothing blew me away. The only course that I can remember was an alcoholic beverage, the Pisco sour, which was hot and foamy on the top and cold on the bottom. That was neat. However, to put things into perspective, I ate at Alinea about a two years ago and we paid the same amount, and I can still remember many of the courses we had there, which were so incredibly wonderful that I could almost cry. The point is that, if the food is good, Ill remember it. I cant really remember what I had at Minibar.It can be an enjoyable experience if $600 means absolutely nothing to you. Otherwise you may leave feeling bad about what you just spent. Im not at the point where $600 means nothing to me...One thing to note is that on Sundays, Cafe Atlantico (the restaurant that Minibar is in) serves a 14 or so course brunch, and its only $35. Its quite good for the price. Do that instead., WORTH EVERY PENNY! The reservation process was long and tedious; it took 5 weeks of calling 5 days a week at 10 am sharp to finally get a reservation for 4. But as I said, it was worth it. Not only was the food innovative, it was beautiful to look at! The entire experience from the flight of sparkling wines & champagnes to the presentation and taste of the 26 course menu couldnt have been better. The chefs were entertaining and fun, the wait staff performed beautifully. The only thing that would have made this experience better would have been if Jose Andres had been there!, Expensive, yes, but it is really, really worth it., Three stars, am I crazy? Let me explain. A month of calling to get a reservation, 6 hour drive to DC and back in a snowstorm and I left hungry for both food and knowledge. The food, although interesting and creative, at times seemed to overreach. The real weakness was in the service/interaction with the staff. The chefs worked for 2 hours right across the bar but there was almost no conversation. They were distant and mechanical. I had expected a much more intimate and interesting personal experience for the price and effort. I expected greater discourse on the creativity and preparation of the culinary offerings, something less wooden. The food did wow at times but my recommendation; save your hard earned money for The French Laundry if you are searching for the perfect dining experience., Culinary rollercoaster. Amazing. The most exciting dining experience Ive had to date. It was so much fun and truly innovative. Also, the service was great and the chefs were friendly and very open to answering questions about each dish. Sure, there might be a couple of things that you might not like personally - i.e. Ive had better, fresher sea urchin before, but what they do with each dish is truly unique.  My one suggestion is to pass on the wine flight/pairing. I love that the Grand Progression has larger pours than a typical wine flight, and since this was such a big night for me, I was eager to have the wine pairing because I felt like it was a huge part of the meal and Id be missing out if I didnt. But the star is the food here. And given the explosion of flavors that you experience in each plate and the pace at which each plate is served (swift but not rushed), Id recommend either having a cocktail or sharing a half bottle with someone. I couldnt even make it through dessert, I was stuffed, and I partially blame that on the wine., It really hard for me to review this meal (and keep in mind that I ate here about a year ago - just getting around to yelping some of my standout meals). In terms of atmosphere, novelty, dining experience, etc, this place is definitely 5 stars. Probably 6 if I could give it an extra bonus. Being able to try small bites of everything, experiment with new flavors, and ask questions of the chefs is really fun and a great thing to do for a special occasion. Case in point: the dragon breathing popcorn which was a popcorn kernel dipped in liquid nitrogen, so when you put it in your mouth and breathed you got steam (is that even the right word?) coming out.However, I was a little turned off by all the foam. It seemed like every dish had some type of ingredient that was turned into foam. After awhile it even made me a bit queasy. Hence the 3 stars. I can even tell you how happy I was to have the Philly Cheesesteak near the end with a hearty bite of meat and thick breading. Settled my stomach a bit (and when a cheesesteak-style tasting settles your stomach, you know that saying something...).Overall, highly recommended for anyone who wants a great dining experience with a lot of new flavors. But be prepared to eat things that may not be entirely to your liking., ive been here once and it was a great experience. Id have given it five stars if I hadnt been to Alinea in Chicago. I wont go through each course but lets just say itll be one of the most unique culinary experiences youll have in your lifetime. ;)Caveat: Should be willing to try new things, Pluses: presentation, culinary theater, great service, very creative foodMinuses: while the food was very inventive, a lot of it didnt stand out when it came to taste. I felt that a lot of the meal was a bit gimmick-y, and thats where the attention went rather than to creating truly delicious food. I enjoyed a new and unusual culinary experience there, but for this price I would much sooner go back to Komi., No buyers remorse after eating here, people. Totally worth the money. Great food, great conversation with the chefs, very educational. I couldnt have asked for more., After a much anticipated trip to Minibar, I thought Id submit my two cents. Just as you read in any review about Minibar, the creations are whimsical and sometimes just crazy fascinating - who knew that food could undergo such metamorphosis and transformation!? Aside from the crazy molecular gastronomy, no one in our party of six came away wowed by the flavors of the food. There were not any real standouts in terms of dishes that had great taste - only the tricks of the molecular gastronomy trade stood out.So, if youre seeking a good, satiating meal for about the same price ($200+ pp not including tip), Id recommend Komi and the like. If you are super curious about molecular gastronomy, Minibar is definitely the place to be.Reservations tip - if you have one of the credit cards that comes with a concierge service, call them and have them call Minibar every day at 10AM - let them do the work.Wine tip - dont do the progression or pairing - just order a good sparkling, champagne, or rose and enjoy the show.Other tip - Ive read some reviews where there are complaints about the interactivity of the chefs. I found that they are as interactive as you are. If you want them to just serve the food, explain it, and not speak to you, they are happy to do that. If you are inquisitive and engaging, they are happy to do the same., KOMI vs MINIBARWe had been trying to get a reservation at Minibar and at Komi for months, finally got through at Komi for Friday night and was miraculously put 4th on the waitlist for our party of 4 for friday (never thought we would actually get a call). Needless to say after an incredible meal at Komi friday night we were shocked to get the call from minibar. Despite the hit to the wallet, we just couldn say no.....KOMI vs MINIBAR here is the play by playThe atmosphere:Minibar: really incredible experience to watch the chefs prepare, but a bit noisy so we couldn always hear the description.Komi: simple, refined quiet.WINNER: Minibar.....for watching the preparation and chatting up the chefsThe service:Minibar: We were greeted at the door and led to the bar where our server met us to explain the wine options. We felt a little like celebrities with people all around Cafe Atlantico staring at us all evening. Downside, the waitress definitely put the pressure on for more expensive wine and additional bottles. Suggestion, bring a great bottle from home and pay the corking fee. Avoid the flights of wine.Komi: Perfect service. We had a friendly team taking care of us including a fabulous somolier who suggested great wines that were actually really reasonable in price. Loved that they dropped all of our plates at the same time. The best thing was the friendly non-pretentious service.WINNER: KOMI....... by a landslideThe foodMinibar: 27 courses all small bites that all had incredible gastronomy. Sadly, in 27 courses we got only seafood and 1 course of foie gras. We also were disappointed not to get the signature philly cheesesteak or the cotton candy eel. There were a few of the dishes that blew us away including the guacamole and coconut bun; but overall the flavors were a bit too concentrated on many courses. The deserts however were outstanding! Sadly, my boyfriend was still hungry when he got home.Komi: 16 courses including 10 small bites which progressed to family style large entr39e and concluded with several small desert plates. The first course brioche was one of the best bites of food I have had in my entire life. But the flavor progression was so well thought out that it blew us away. Only course we would skip is the mascarpone dates which cleansed the palate, but with a jackhammer of salt and sugar. With that said, we quickly forgot about it while eating the deconstructed gyro with homemade tzatziki and all the samplings including incredible lemon and cumin salts. Deserts were very light which was great after a heavy entr39e.WINNER: Komi......for the incredible progression and my boyfriend didn want a snack when we got home.CostMinibar: 150 per person without winesKomi: 135 per person without wineGRAND WINNER.......KOMI takes it hands down. Entire experience was incredible without the pretentiousness and focus entirely on the foods simple perfection. I can wait for the opportunity to return!THE RUNNER UP......Minibar because the show was great, but the food left something to be desired. In the end, while we were delighted by the culinary science, you could probably leave Oyamel feeling more satisfied without a burned out palate. Would I make the effort for a reservation again, probably not., When can I go back?Skip the wine paring/flight and just get a bottle or a glass of something light.The experience is awesome, the chefs were incredible. They answered every question that we had and were great company for the evening. Since there is no real wiggle room in the menu, Ill let all of the other reviews speak for the quality of the dishes. Out of the 27 courses, I cant think of a single one that wasnt at a minimum really good. Most of them leaned towards incredible and perfect. The chefs, creative directors and staff at minibar are the best of the best, you really cant go wrong.So seriously, when can I go back?
45|mintwood-place-washington|The Tagliatelle bolognese blew my mind. Definitely coming back., I am giving a full review as the place is new and could use some constructive feedback. First, it is way too expensive for what you get and the mediocre service (will give more details). The place is a bit noisy, the service a bit slow and the portions a bit small. I arrived on time for an 8pm reservation for which I had to wait until 8:35pm, though the place did not look that busy. I sat at the bar, where the bartender, George was pleasant, but failed to respond properly to a simple complaint by the person sitting next to me, who got the burger (and said was great) but chose the salad instead of fries, and I can tell you that there were about 4 leaves of iceberg lettuce in his plate. If George understood good service, he would have gone back to the kitchen and gotten the guy more salad, upon hearing the customers complaint. Not appropriate for a $16 burger. We finally sat and waited about 10 minutes to be acknowledged at all, not even water! We were torn between the bottle of Pinot Noir or the bottle of Sangiovese, and the waiter recommended them equally, but the Sangiovese was worse than any other red wine Ive had at a good restaurant, he should have never recommended it. I had the hangar steak frites, which I requested medium, but was more like medium-well, and a frankly a bit dry on the ends. The frites were overcooked, seemed like they had perhaps been fried more than once. Not great for a $22 plate. My date had the grilled salmon/lentils, delicious, and quite perfect. Overall I give this place just an OK because for that price I expect impeccable service (or at least water shortly after seating) and generous portions with steak cooked as ordered, and fresh fries, is that too much to ask? I may or may not give it another shot., I was just stopping by to write a review after my visit this weekend and yesterday. Sad to see the reviewer above complaining about George; one of the reasons I specifically stopped in to Mintwood yesterday was because of George. He is one of the best bartenders in the city and truly one of my favorite people. It always makes me a little dubious when folks are commenting on the service of others. You have no idea what is happening at another persons table/barstool, if this person has been a problem in the past, if they are being a jerk/unreasonable, etc.On to the other stuff: The food is great, bar service fantastic (Dom served us Sunday and was lovely as well) and I really love the space. Cant wait to see how the place grows., As the affable bartender, George, says: restaurant and staff are still working on their muscle memory. I ordered a $27 dish with three ingredients (a whole wood-fired dorade, fennel and picholine olives); for starters, it wasnt a whole fish -- they left the tail on but not the head (there are tasty bits in there ya know) and they forgot the olives. Ill try again, but at that price point better places will come to mind long before Mintwood., I really had a sub-par experience. My fiance and I were looking forward to having a few drinks and dessert at this place... The drink I ordered was just terrible (to no fault of the bartender- it simply tasted like black licorice which isnt my favorite) I simply asked my waiter to bring me a beer instead and he looked at me like I was crazy. After 30 minutes without a replacement drink I overheard my waiter complaining to his manager about me... They were standing maybe ten feet away. We were really looking forward to going to this place, the food was good, atmosphere beautiful, but the wait staff was unforgivably rude and we wont be back., Get the pork for two! We had head cheese, frog legs and escargot hush puppies to start - not for the faint of heart! Parking is a challenge, but hey, its Adams Morgan., the roasted check was great and I almost never order chicken in a restaurant. The bolognese was great as well as was the winter salad.Service was good especially for a place that just opened.Wine list was not varied but well priced.Great neighborhood spot and I would certainly return., I went the other night, having greatly anticipated the restaurants opening, as I walk by the windows everyday. But I have to say I wasnt impressed. I waited a while to go to the restaurant, to give it time before I judged it. And I will say the service was pretty good. I had the $16 burger and ordered in the side of brussels sprouts to share. And yet both were very mediocre. The burger had a sauce on it and yet it wasnt mentioned on the menu, and was very tasteless. Had a cocktail too and wasnt that impressed. At the end of the night, I found that the bill didnt justify the experience. And Im usually not that picky on restaurants. I just felt nickel and dimed with sides that start at $8, to $12 and beyond. And expensive starters and desserts.That said, I think the decor is a wonderful, a great atmosphere, and a nice new option for the neighborhood. But I do believe there are better options in terms of food, price and overall value in a restaurant. I understand it must cost a lot to create a new restaurant, but I think the prices are too sky high for what you get versus Cashions - which is at the same price point - and yet some of the best food in the city. Or Napoleons, which is much less expensive and yet excellent food. Hopefully the food will get better with time, and maybe then the sky high prices will be justified., First, the bad: I ordered a Woodrow Wilson cocktail, which I am sure is a very creative concoction, however it offended my palette - strange taste of cardamom mixed with gin, berries and something spicy. Way too much going on in one martini glass - I sent it back. Ordered the grilled baby Octopus as a starter, and I wasnt a fan. Although the texture of the octopus itself was very tender, the mustard sauce was nothing to write home about and the vegetables seemed doused in oil and overcooked. The good: We were seated pretty quickly in spite of it being a Friday night. Service here was extremely good. The waitress was very attentive, helpful with recommendations and just likable overall. There is also a manager (or owner?) who seems to be walking around, scanning the tables and making sure that they are not missing a beat with the little service details - they all seem to be focused on being attentive and nice. Having said that however, the biggest reason I would come back here is for the Skate wing main course dish. It was delicious. The texture of the fish was fantastic, tender but also a little crispy on the edges. It was served with a chickpea pancake and a ratatouille that was not too liquid-y. One of the better fish dishes I have had in DC in a while actually., Promise. A little rough on welcome and service, but to be expected on their 3rd Saturday. Food was good to very good. Recommend the pork rinds, cassoullet, tagliatelle. Cocktails were good and prices were reasonable. Once they get the kinks ironed out, could be as good as Cashions., The good:- Poached straight from Cashions, George adds a familiar face and will become a fast friend.- The lamb tongue moussaka and tagliatelle are outstanding; the burger and fries are good but I wouldnt return for them.- The restaurant has a refined, rustic design - pleasant to spend time there.The bad:- The baby octopus tasted a bit bland. The tart was one-dimensional.- The lights should be dimmed, at least after nine (obviously a minor complaint).Overall a welcome addition to Adams Morgan., Mintwood Place is okay but, at this point, not special enough for the cost. Id rather spend the same amount at Ardeo/Bardeo, District Kitchen, or insert your favorite upscale new american place here. Ambiance:The atmosphere could be cool (the wainscoting and metal walls are nice, good lighting) but it feels like a few too many tables have been squashed into the space and so every table feels just a bit too close to the next one. The actual vibe of the place read older and money-ed rather than hip, young, urban - which is fine, but the decor and the emphasis on speak-easy style cocktails suggests the restaurant was going for a different vibe.Food:As with many new restaurants the food was hit-or-miss. Components were great but the overall meal left a lot to be desired. The escargot hush puppies were delicious and set high expectations for the rest of the meal. But my rabbit was just okay (although the polenta it came with was divine), my dates steak frites was very disappointing (I have never seen him not finish a steak and he could only get through half, plus the fries were diner-style not paris-style) and the brussel sprouts side came out half way through the meal and was cold in the center, without a good char on the leaves, and overall way too mushy (cold and mushy? that is hard to do). Drinks:Were good. The scrooge (basically a darker dark and stormy) was pretty great, as was the lone ranger. The marilyn monroe was interesting but not quite worth it. There was a decent draft selection though.Overall:The menu needs work. This might be a good place to go for a drink with an appetizer or two, but only if the atmosphere becomes a little more lively (maybe it will on the weekend?). As it is right now, I would not make Mintwood Place a destination, and if you are in AdMo looking for a place I would try Napoleons or Jack Rose or Bourbon over this place., The appetizers and desserts were great, but the main meal disappointed a little. We started with the warm olives (compliments the warm bread nicely); deviled pickled eggs (only 3 but worth it); and escargot hush puppies (excellent appetizer for the table). The goat cheese & beet mountain pie is a must; the chili soup was also good; the potato & leek soup was interesting. For the main meal we tried the cassoulet (very hearty, white beans and various meats like chicken, sausage, and duck) and skate wing (little flimsy). The desserts were all great: tart key lime pie topped with pomegranate seeds; baked Alaska (I watched Top Chef Just Desserts too many times to pass this one up); creme brulee (lighter as brulees go, but soft on the palette); and brownie sundae (complete with sprinkles). For drinks we had the scrooge (perfect for citrus lovers) and don quixote (paint stripper strength). Service is great, and ambiance is a steam punk vibe. Little pricey (table bill for 4ppl was $250 before tip), but the generous portions and service make up for that. I also like that its not on the main drag., Meh is the best way to describe the service at Mintwood. We had reservations for 8 but when we only showed up with 6 they decided NOT to give us the table. Instead they suggested we push two bar tables together. We decided to make the best of it and climbed up on the stools and squeezed in. After our server disappeared for awhile I was able to flag down someone else who would take our order. When the meal was over we requested that they separate the check between us. They said they could only do 4 and it was restaurant policy... excuse me?! We complained and they finally agreed to split the check evenly. Now for the positive. The meal was pretty good. Highlights were the escargot hush puppies and the goat cheese & beet mountain pie. Will I be back? Probably not. Mintwood, you need to do better., Great atmosphere. Best service I have received in dc restaurant ever, and the pork for two with brussel sprouts and bacon was to die for. Steak tartare app was dilish. So good., Loved the Tagliatelle bolognese . The service was great; did not feel rushed out after finishing our meals although it was a crowded Friday night. Great nibbles especially the deviled eggs., Everything was excellent. From the service to the food to the decor. I had the Woodrow Wilson cocktail and it was delicious and not overly sweet like some cocktails can be. We had the deviled pickled eggs (an excellent twist on a classic), The dorade (perfectly cooked and lightly seasoned), and the baked alaska was to die for. Love this place! Will be back soon to try the rest of the menu., Great new edition to the neighborhood. Awesome food, ambience and service. Had a veggie risotto (on special) it was superb. The cocktail menu is creative and fun., The food was great . We had burrata & asparagus appetizer, grilled octopus, and a German tart. The halibut was much better than the sable fish for an entre. We had an amazing bottle of Pinot, which really added to the meal but Im crediting the member of our group who selected it as much as the restaurant for carrying it :) Im glad they change the menu with the seasons. Ill definitely be back. Missing the 5th star because our table was in the back near the kitchen, which I was a bit disappointed in given wed made the reservations weeks in advance and indicated it was for a birthday. There werent any major gaps in service, but there also wasnt anything above and beyond that made it special., I am so excited my favorite darling chef, Cedric Maupillier, is back in town. He was wonderful at Central and is really great at this new spot. Veggie Risotto was great.Congratulations Cedric on your return, The wine list is amazing. The burger was awesome as was the iceberg salad. Dressing was perfection and the smoked bacon was crisp and great flavor. The appetizers such as escargot fritters and flatbread were amazing! I definitely will be back again and bring different people., I really liked Mintwood Place. Great cocktail and wine list, and the appetizers were superb. We had the blistered shishito peppers, roasted mushrooms, and pickled deviled eggs. All amazing, and they came out very quickly.My entree was the risotto, which was made from five grains. Also quite good, and the portion size was just right. Roasted tomato gazpacho was very tasty as well. I glad this place is near our neighborhood in Columbia Heights., Good food, meh service.I went to Mintwood Place this evening with my partner and a friend. We ordered drinks and food in two rounds. After the first round was eaten, we ordered more drinks. When round two of the food came around, we hadn gotten our drinks yet, and some of the food was missing, namely mine. My dining company enjoyed their meals and I nibbled on a friend fries while waiting for my two dishes. Eventually, the second batch of drinks came but my food was nowhere to be seen. Neither was our waiter. Finally, I flagged him down and asked him about my food. He seemed confused, but said he check on my order. After spotting him chatting with diners at another table instead of checking on my food, I never saw him again.I did, however, flag down the manager and asked him (now 20 minutes after asking about my two dishes, and as my dining companions took their final bites) to cancel my food and bring us the check. He apologized briefly and returned shortly with the check. Nothing comped, just my two dishes removed. Not only did I leave hungry, but my experience was spoiled. I sat and watched as the rest of my table gorged themselves but I got nothing, and nothing more than an i sorry. Well, Mintwood Place, I sorry that I have to give you only two stars. Hire more competent servers and apologize more heartily when they screw up. Comp us a round of drinks or something. Paying full price for bad service is not what I call fine dining., My friend who has lived in DC for most of her life recommended this restaurant so myself and my boyfriend went to check out the Sunday brunch. We got there at 1:30pm and the patio was packed and so was the interior. We waited for seating and got lucky with one of the window seats, which was great until we realized that we soon be forgotten about since we were nestled in the corner. The first person we saw after about 15 minutes of just sitting there was the bus boy who came and gave us cold water. Then another 10 minutes goes by and the waitress finally shows up with menus. We took a quick look and decided to order right away, since it took so long to get anyone to our table to begin with. Then, our drink order was wrong when it came 20 minutes later and at this point, I didn bother to make the correction because I just didn care anymore. After more than 40 minutes of waiting for our food and wishing our waitress would remember that she had customers in the corner with empty mimosa glasses, I started to notice that no one in the dining area was eating. At this point, our neighbors who had been sitting for just as long as we had went up to the hostess to complain. Honestly, if I had cash in my pocket, I would have just left money for our drinks and left. I have other things to do with my time. Then, after close to an hour, the waitress comes back over and sort of said sorry for the wait and gave a half assed explanation that they were just so busy. My interpretation is that the chefs can get quality food out of the kitchen and the wait staff does nothing to counteract the waiting, such as apologizing for the wait or refilling drink orders. We got our food after an hour of waiting and it was NOT worth the wait. Part of my food was burnt. I really just wanted to get out of there at this point. The only thing I could think to do is tell my fellow Washingtonians and travelers to go somewhere else. This place is nothing but hype and terrible service. I eat out all over the city and this is the worse dining experience I have had., My wife and I ate here Saturday night. Started off with a whiskey/root liqueur drink which was excellent. Escargot hush puppies and Pork Cracklins highly recomended. I had the skillet chicken which was solid... My wife had scallops and the risotto. She really liked both. We will be back., There are some kinks to work out, but being a fairly new restaurant in the Adams Morgan scene, Mintwood does hold its own. Ill start with the not-so-good:Service - terribly slow and inattentive. Im not sure if its the intended vibe or just an unfortunate lack of servers, but either way the delays throughout the meal were problematic. Five minutes just to be initially acknowledged, ten minutes for some water, another ten for cocktails and bread...you get the annoyance. Quality of the meat - subpar on a couple of dishes (e.g. hanger steak, burger). These dishes were lacking in flavor and were not properly cooked. Plus, their respective sides failed to compensate for the tremendous blandness. OK, now for the better:Ambiance - lively, rustic, and unpretentious. This is a great eatery for small groups or a casual date, a true come-as-you-are-but-simultaneously-fancy type of place. Not to mention the location is fantastic for pre-dinner aperitifs or post-meal shenanigans.A few standout dishes - escargot hushpuppies and tagliatelle bolognese are exquisite. Both packed with flavor and executed with perfection.I look forward to giving Mintwood additional time to find its groove and iron out those few remaining wrinkles. Until next time..., This is my new favorite restaurant! The ambiance is great. The staff is educated and really great. The food was amazing! The drinks were great. The items on the menu sound simple, but the if you ask the staff about them you get a gourmet foodie explanation of the dish. We got the pork for two - it was great and came with a whole roasted garlic. The broccolini was the best Ive ever had. Oh...and the butter was delicious! Sounds funny, but they have great bread and butter and the butter was really soft and grassy tasting.You need a reservation and the tables were pretty close together., The food was good, but the place was really loud on a Friday night. If youre looking for something intimate (or youre with people who are hard-of-hearing) this is NOT the place for you. All the dishes I ordered were quality: a warm beet and goat cheese appetizer and the pasta with meat sauce, and the desserts especially stood out: strawberry sorbet and the rhubarb/strawberry crumble. Id go back - just might need to invest in a megaphone, first., Second experience: a great meal that started high and ended on a low note. Our appetizers, drinks, and entree (amish chicken) came out in a timely manner and our server checked on us. Fine. Then she did not come back for about 30-40 minutes after we were done eating. We observed another server in our area who was comparably very attentive and wished we had gotten seated with him instead. When she finally came around again, we did not want dessert or anything, we just wanted to leave. I still have to give it 4 stars in hopes that this was an off night for the server, as the food really is delicious here.The goat cheese and beet mountain pie app and the bolognese entree are both outstanding here, and the bolognese is enough food for 2-3 people (or more if you share a few apps). But, if you want chicken, theirs does not disappoint., Have heard a lot about this restaurant and was excited to finally try it. The food was very tasty. The service was spectacular. My friend and I were incredibly indecisive and the waiter was great about not rushing us and making suggestions. The only downside is it was VERY loud so a bit hard to hear. They some very interesting dishes. We had pork, frog legs, soft shell crabs, and brownie sundae as well as some excellent wine. Everything was delicious. This place isnt far from my house so am excited to have a great place in the neighborhood. Oh and we didnt have reservations, but had no problem getting in. I might add this was on a Tuesday evening for 2 around 7:30pm. Im sure this might not work on the weekend., Underwhelming. The octopus salad was described by the server as a traditional octapus salad (oh really? i didn know there was a traditional octopus salad). It was stewed tomatoes, mustard, and pan fried squid that had a very slight residual flavor of the bleach sometimes used to extend its shelf life. They are very heavy-handed with the sauce in this place. The burger was pan fried, not grilled, and had very little flavor, except for the extra heavy russian dressing on the bun. The blueberry pie was too lemony, not sweet enough (for someone who rarely eats sweets) and was topped with a tangy (read bitter) frozen yogurt. Another disappointment. Made me think I should go back in the kitchen and teach the chef a few things. The wine list was meh...lots of too fruit-forward reds. The highlights? The bread! Yes, the bread! The strawberry rhubarb crumble, and the other guests!...who sat at tables on either side of us. We were all foodies disappointed with our meals. But we had fun talking to each other, comparing notes on favorite restaurants. Service was....well superior...she acted like we were a bunch of yahoos that didn appreciate over condimented, poorly designed menus items. Please, there are other places that will appreciate your visit. Go to them. Run to them. But don come here. Also -- very loud and the restaurant wasn even full., ***3.5 stars***Two words: Escargot hushpuppies!! Sheer deliciousness. I just wish that the rest of the menu was as inventive. I dont eat red meat so I didnt have many options. I went with the chicken, which sounded utterly dull. However, I was quite pleased with the flavor. Not sure that Id go back for the chicken, but Id definitely go for the hushpuppies--and then go someplace else for dinner., Overrated, and overpriced. Yes, the ambience is good. Yes, the food is good. And, yes, the service is good. However, there is nothing so special about their dishes: many of the dishes are something that you can make it at home easily. To be fair, I should mention that the escargot hush puppies were super yummy. However, main dishes we ordered, Bolongese and pork dish, were not as good as I expected. Especially, after reading the Washington Post review, I was disappointed in the restaurant and the WP. Maybe the restaurant should take the review down from the website to set the right expectation. The biggest downside of the restaurant for me was overpriced dishes. If I am going to pay $30-60 for my meal, I want the dish to be exquisite (with amazing sauces), well presented, and prepared in a way that I can never prepare. But, it was kind of a home-cooked style meal than chef prepared meal. I do think that the restaurant contributes to the adams morgan dining scene. The place is well decorated (kind of polished rustic feel), and good for meeting people. As long as you have the right expectation, I think you may enjoy this restaurant. I say, why not try and decide whether it is your new favorite restaurant or not. Happy chewing!, Well this place was really a letdown for brunch. I follow a blog called bitches who brunch and it is usually spot on. They gave this place an A so I was excited to try it out. Things started off poorly and really didn get any better. I think the bitches who brunch really should reconsider their grade on this one.First of all you cannot make a reservation here on Opentable, they use some weird other system which you can access through their website. This already annoyed me, but whatever...we arrived a bit early to our reservation and were initially impressed with the decor and the fact that there is a patio. There were a couple tables that were being cleared on the patio. First the host told us it would be just a minute while they cleared the table, then he went to talk to some other patron at the bar for about 10 minutes while we just stood around looking at the table wondering if we could sit down. Finally some other guy came inside and asked if we were being helped...we sat at our table about 15 minutes after it was ready because the host just completely ignored us (and about 5 others who walked into the restaurant after us).Then nobody came to our table for another 15 minutes. Just no waiter, no water, nothing! The guy finally came by and we placed our food order. My partner got coffee while I got a $10!?! Bloody Mary.First the drinks came out. The coffee was fine - nothing great, but not terrible either. The Bloody Mary must have been the smallest one Ie ever had! For $10 I expected something huge and great. This was weak and VERY small. What a ripoff.Then our app came out - we ordered FRENCH FRIES and they were $7!? I expected something amazing again...nope, just french fries with a dipping side. Fine, but nothing exceptional.For entrees my partner got the hangover special and I ordered the Bacon & onion flammekueche, sunny side up egg. The hangover special was actually quite good - a total grease bomb and a huge number of french fries and a meat patty. Had I known this I would never have ordered french fries for an app - but his meal was very good (though it must have had 3000 calories in it).My flammekueche was good, but really small - sort of a tiny pizza with an egg on top. It seemed much more like an app to me than an entree.Anyway, the waiter never offered to refill the coffee and I don believe he refilled the water either. So after my $10 Bloody Mary, $7 French Fries, $12 Entree plus coffee (without a refill) and my partners entree we spent about $60 on brunch and it was really underwhelming and I left hungry. The food is fine - really average - but the ridiculous prices and terrible service take this establishment down from what could be 3* to 2*., I was pretty disappointed by this place. I met a friend for happy hour and there was a big chalkboard advertising the happy hour specials that said: $3 beer $5 wine. We each got a beer on tap but were charged full price for them on the bill. When we inquired about this, the bartender haughtily told us that the only $3 option was Rolling Rock in a can. It not that the beers we were charged for were outrageously priced or anything (if I remember correctly, they were about $8.00-$9.00 each--pretty reasonable) it just felt misleading to advertise happy hour the way that they did. Even though our appetizers were fairly tasty and the ambiance was fine, the service was such a turn off, I don think Il come back. We were perfectly friendly and civil with our inquiry and the bartender was condescending and snotty in return., Ive been here twice, once for dinner and once for brunch. Both meals were top-notch, with great service, delicious food, and a wonderful atmosphere. Cant recommend it highly enough., Yummmmmm. I went there for brunch a few weeks ago and everything was delicious. Bacon was perfect and I loved the huge bowl of melon, much better than a little side of fruit. Overall, they prepare simple dishes very well and I will be back again!, I live blocks from here and dont come here often. Food is pricey and just ok.I remember getting the duck, which was ok. But the flavors didnt mix at all. Duck and sauerkraut?? The sauerkraut completely overwhelms the duck flavor. And the duck wasnt cooked nicely...should have crispy skin, fat that melts like butter, done medium rare...alas it was just poorly done...Ill try it again because its so close, but I just wasnt impressed.Especially since Obama came here...why exactly??, First time here - went for brunch. Apparently they just started doing brunch three weeks ago. We sat down and no one acknowledged us for about 15 minutes - when we asked to be helped. The waffles were brunt and were disguised with powdered sugar..meh.Cute and lively place - but dont need to go back., Went to the restaurant for brunch. The service was terrible, the server didnt bother to come to our table for at least 15 mins, reluctantly asked if we wanted coffee, then didnt bother to provide cream. I had to ask twice for the cream before he finally brought some to our table. My fiancee had a bug in her water, we asked the waiter twice to get a new water, he didnt bother to provide, we finally asked one of the bus boys, who ran and got another water for us. We ordered a bloody mary when we ordered our meal, but the waiter neglected to bring it to us, until we finally asked whether we were going to get it before the meal arrives. This was surprising by itself but made even more frustrating when we noted the table next to us ordered one on the fly and the same waiter brought it to him within minutes.The food was flavorful and good, especially the bacon. But the portions were very very small, which was surprising given the high prices and the fact it was a brunch menu.Overall I would say its not worth the visit, the negatives outweigh the positives., New favorite restaurant in DC. Great place to take friends or out-of-towners for a fancy-ish meal. The steak frites is amazing. Steak is always cooked perfectly and the frites are delicious. I love the brownie sundae dessert and the burrata is a fantastic appetizer. Couldnt ask for more. Will definitely be back., We finally got around to having brunch at Mintwood, and it was pretty alright. Not terrible, not to-rave-about either. There are some twists on the classic brunch items, and the fav standbys. The champagne cocktail I ordered was not as I expected-- there was no fruit juice, but in its place a liquor of some kind. I suspected it was Campari, because it was a little bitter and pinkish. I finished it, but did not want to try another. The bloody mary was bland and tasted like a store-bought mix. Id like to have seen some little tomato seeds and a dash of spice from horseradish or peppers (not Tobasco.)The one thing that really did stand out was the croissant with butter and orange marmalade. It came to the table still warm, and the marmalade was really delicious. The eggs benedict was a little mushy--egg whites were still a touch raw, and the hollandaise tasted weird. The waitress did notice it was not being eaten, and insisted he order something else. She brought a waffle to replace it, which was very nice, and it was pretty good! The service was great, and some of the food was great, too, so theres a chance we might try it again. But with so many options in the area, it might be awhile until we get around to it., Good, but very expensive. Service was excellent (though definitely tried to sell us more). Food was good (very different flavors); very hard to place as a certain area/ethnicity/type. It was kind of a southern-US, French, fusion... Place is kid friendly, though upscale (they have a very nice kids menu)., Had dinner last week on the outside patio at street level. The best part of the meal was the late summer weather and a peaceful week-day eve in an otherwise noisy Adams Morgan. As I live in the neighborhood, I had been meaning to try Mintwood all summer.Sorry, while I loved the decor (rustic-modern, lotsa great design items) and it was clean and fresh looking, the food and service were mediocre. At first glance I thought this would finally be my fancy neighborhood place for upscale dinners. The prices indicated as much. The mussels were tiny and not as fresh tasting, and the meuniere was a bit bland, the fries were ok. The bread was delicious. Oddly I chose the deviled eggs for an appetizer which was quite filling - tasty, but really just basic. The beer I ordered when I sat down arrived mid way through my entree, and only after I asked the busboy and then my waitress again about it. My waitress seemed distracted and yet, quite opinionated...wasnt really that pleasant. It was not a busy night either.Given some of the nice french places around the corner on 18th street, the inexpensive yet super fresh and authentic Amsterdam Falafel, Pasta Mia and others, and especially a perennial favorite, Perrys one flight up, its unlikely Ill spend my money at Mintwood again. Apparently Mintwood & Perrys are owned by the same people.To be fair, new places sometimes need time to readjust, so perhaps Ill give it a second chance next year to see if price-meets-quality-equals-a-great-dining-experience. My critique aside, it appeared other diners were enjoying themselves. Check it out on your own!, Solid upscale comfort food with unique twists and ingredients you wouldnt normally find:Escargot hush puppies - not too salty, not too breaded either, a pleasant blend of the two. Definitely recommend.Lamb tongue moussaka - Probably my favorite dish of the evening, although it is an appetizer it packs some great flavors. Very tender and delicate in texture, also comes on top of a bed of eggplant/vegetable blend that adds a good balance.Duck breast au poivre - Second favorite, the breast is cut into plenty slices on top of sauerkraut and crispy bread and the mixture of flavors is phenomenal. The duck is soft and the sauerkraut adds a slight acidity that makes it unique.Carolina shrimp & porgy - Seafood dish that comes with a healthy amount of shrimp. Nicely cooked, and the porgy tastes very meaty. Side of brussels sprouts with bacon - nothing more needs to be said. Get it.Alaska flambe - More for show, they light it on fire in front of you and it has entertainment value for the table. The dessert itself was 4/5, the weakest dish of the night. Overall a great place to go with friends on a casual night, the restaurant doesnt feel stuffy nor does it imply that diners need be suited up. Would definitely come back., Been trying to get my opportunity to grab a bite here. Reservations for four, for dinner certainly brought out a lot of options.A real nice looking place, great crowd and well dressed, seasonably older nothing wrong with that. Tables flowed with wine and cocktails everywhere I could see and lots of happy faces (some really nice dressed people who could put me to shame). Best part, if you come a little under-dressed nobody is gonna care, so it feels welcoming and not hoity-toity.One key point though, we sat in one of the cushioned tables by the window. With its short pillows and paisley like accented golden thread it looked inviting. It wasn horrible, but we soon realised 3 of us were jammed in a corner sort of with a small table and very little room to get up if we had to go to the bathroom. If you have a choice pick another table, but honestly it not the end of the world.Starting with the appetizers we dove into the escargot hushpuppies. YOU WANT TO ORDER THESE, I don CARE if you think they might sound gross, they are decadantly soft, wonderful crisp with a melt in your mouth filling and oh ... I am drooling on my keyboard just thinking about them right now... Which also brings us to a memorable item which is the much talked about shishito peppers.The roulette wheel spins and you chomp down and you don know what you will get. For me though, my days of chowin on spicy food are much long passed, but lord knows I love it. Do you know what youe doing? asked my wife. Yes I do, it for the good of life and hopefuly tasty food!! By this time I was popping these green and crackly morsels into my mouth like popcorn. They give you MANY of these. Ok then... but I don wanna hear about this when we get home tonight. Let just say she got the last word. I worked a theory that the more green ones had the less heat compared to the singed brown cousins on the plate, but I think it doesn matter, the salty crackling really hits wonderfuly, these truly pop in your mouth, and it seemed there was no heat on any of them for me once I got past 6. Burrata doesn dissapoint either with a nice mix of kale and tasty greens. Past then... it was just more joy.Main entrees provided seemed quite solid. The menu is a bit pricey, drinks are quite varied. A great beer and wine list is available, cocktails are so-so, but worth checking out for a few interesting tastes. I thought my bourbon cocktail was a bit unlike whiskey, and not much going appearance wise, but this is really pulling hairs here.Food mains are quite interesting, basic sort of comfort food, but there are dishes that seem like a fun mish mash of cobbling. Moueles and Frites (Belgian), A lamb Tagine (Morocco), Then many classic simple American fare (Steak, Duck, Burger so on). Settling in the duck even with sauerkraut hits well. Very plentiful, with a few grapes served with a real nice sauce. The sauerkraut (something I really don care for), isn too briny either, and it a good melding of flavors with the crackling bread on the bottom.I didn get to try my friends burger (sharing burgers is kind of um... awkward), but a small pizza Bacon & onion flammekueche is quite crisp, with lots aromatic smoke bacon and a very light texture. A real neat sort of thin flatbread/pizza, interesting.Looking back the menu is quite simple, but it done real well. Pepper this with very attentive service, and real nice touches when bringing the items it provides a real welcoming and warming experience. Our waitress didn even write a single thing down.That said, a flaming baked Alaska set the final touch, and we all went back home warm and content. The wallet took a hit, but I didn seem to care. Perhaps just a glass of wine and a steak could more than keep me happy next go, but till then those puppies need to be adopted more often by myself., Still havent managed to have a proper dinner here, but Im not sure its necessary to really enjoy the place. Their range of nibbles, starters, and sides makes their entrees almost superfluous. The wine & beer lists are fantastic, and the bartenders make the place my new favorite neighborhood watering hole.The maple cracklin & country pate, although not recommended by your cardiologist, are too good to pass up. The wood-grilled brussel sprouts with bacon and potato gratin can make you forget that theyre side dishes. Among the entrees that I have tried, the bacon cheeseburger, and its diametrical opposite, the vegetarian risotto, are great if you want an uncomplicated but delicious meal., Second visit to Mintwood. Drinks took a little long due to crowd, but bartender couldnt have been nicer and ended up picking the drinks up. The cocktail is really fantastic with lots of options. Food was better than first visit. Steak tartar, same as last time, knockout, the potatoes, really add a texture. The flambe bacon and onion is an example of this wood fired oven they have just multiplying flavor. Entrees were mackarel with shrimp. Served from wood oven with artichokes, pearl onions, herbs, really a flavorful yet simple dish. Better half had stewed lamb necks in Port with a quinoa, hearty and delicious. Both lentils and potato gratin for sides, we ordered too much food but they do well to go. Our service was one of the best experiences have had in DC, and I will for sure go back. Great job., What can I say?? One of the best dining experiences Ive had in a while. From the moment we walked in the door the staff made us feel right at home. We sat at a table right in front of the kitchen. The chef interacted with us as we watched him work his magic in the kitchen. I wish I could tell you my favorite dish but everything was superb. The reserve wine list is outstanding and the sommelier picked a perfect wine to pair with our four course dinner. My fianc39 and I have decided that this is our new favorite dinner spot. Thank you to everyone at Mintwood for a wonderful evening., I really like Mintwood Place. The only reason you dont see 5 stars is b/c I wish there was another veg entree besides the risotto to choose from. Said risotto-five grain w/the freshest corn, mushrooms and broccolini that fall offers-was delicious. My friend had the chicken which she said was very good. To die for huckleberry and fig tart w/vanilla ice cream, I had to battle with my friend to get the last bite. Great wines by the glass. Knowledgeable and friendly wait staff. Patio is super for both dog and people watching. I like to visit Mintwood on a lazy Sunday afternoon for brunch or early on a weekday evening for dinner. That way you can get the table of your choice to better have a chance of viewing everyone out and about. Looking forward to trying whatevers on the menu for the winter season. Grateful to be able to walk here., Have now been here on three separate occasions. While I have yet to try their dinner menu, I have had two excellent Brunches and an unbelievable burger.FOOD - The Pork Hash was soooooooooo good, I ended up ordering it again on my next visit. Never being able to decide whether I want something savory or sweet for brunch, I also got an order of the Pancakes (Blueberry and Chocolate Chip). Always a good thing when a restaurant offers you the option to order pancakes individually.Their cheeseburger is a little eclectic, but even for a traditionalist such as myself, the quality of the beef and the flavors of the toppings were incredible. They also offer Goose Islands Sofie, which must have been crafted to pair up with burgers.AMBIANCE - It has a Restoration Hardware feel to it with spacious seating, decent sidewalk seating area and a nice bar. I personally liked the casual, reclaimed furniture feel.SERVICE - I am usually rather critical of this aspect of the dining experience and can only applaud the consistently great service I received here. In particular, the same manager that was present on all three visits was on point. He was all over the place, involved and always gracious., The Long Island duck breast is to die for...and the brussel sprouts and bacon were also top notch. Great wine list, excellent vibe, good service, and everything is well-presented. Fantastic spot...period., Ive only been here twice, but the food has been great and service pretty good as well. Its a nice place to just grab a drink at the bar.My only complaint is there are not enough vegetarian options. Add more please!, Escargot hush puppies, Long Island duck breast, and one hell of a pigeon--all delicious. The drinks were excellent, the service divine. (Thank you, Nina.) Well be back., Their menu is essentially my favorite kind of thing: French-inspired bistro. Everything we had was awesome; dont miss the escargot hush puppies! Filling and sofa king good., My partner and I went to Mintwood for Sunday brunch on the advice of a few people and websites. We started with the country pate (chicken and pork) and the mixed greens salad, both of which were very tasty. I actually changed my entree order in the middle of brunch -- I originally ordered the eggs benedict but saw someone else near me get the hangover special (a hamburger covered in cheese french fries and an egg) and decided on that instead. It was a good choice, because what I had was not something regular like eggs benedict but was something unique to Mintwood. My partner had the ham and eggs, which was very good and a hearty breakfast. Overall, the food was tasty and well-executed.What others are saying about the noise level is true...it rather loud in there, especially in the middle of the restaurant. I can see how this place would be fun for a relaxed brunch, but for a romantic night out or business meal, I wouldn recommend the atmosphere of Mintwood. The service was fine, but nothing special. Brunch was good, but for an actual meal, I would recommend Cashion Eat Place next door., This place is amazing. I went with a party of 8 so I was able to taste quite a bit of the menu on my first endeavor. I would like to back up though, to the call I made for reservation. They have a policy about large party before 8:45 because the place is small and large parties tend to linger. Once you see the size of the place, it understandable why they say this. They were however, at pretty short notice I might add, able to accommodate me for 8:45 and actually sat me a bit early. Now on to the service. We had Brett for our server. He was phenomenal. He was attentive, with a very needy party. He made sure no glasses went unfilled. He had suggestions and was knowledgeable about the menu. I felt comfortable taking his suggestions and he even made me a special drink for my birthday. Last but not least the food. Holy Cow! We started off with devils eggs, pork cracklins, clam chowder, and side salad. I tasted everything but the salad. My favorite was the pork grinds for sure because Im addicted but the devils eggs where the perfect balance of tart from the pickling and rich from the creamy yolk. The best entree on the table was the duck, hands down. Although all the dishes where really good the duck was to die for. Cooked to perfection atop a potato crisp and sauerkraut. The Amish chicken is simple but juice and full of flavor. The bollegnese was just right amount of sauce to meat ratio and Im jealous of who get to eat the leftovers. All in all it was an amazing experience and Im so glad that I was able to enjoy it with friends on my birthday., After a night of partying in DC, the best thing to do is brunch the next day. We decided to hit up this spot.1. GET their blueberry pancakes2. GET their omlet3. Wash it down with coffeeOur waiter was super hipster but also friendly and unpretentious at the same time. Amazing organic ingredients and flavors. I ate outside on a warm fall day!, Good food but for the prices I expected a lot more. I really liked the atmosphere and decor, its very warm and cozy. Several people in my party had the amish chicken which was very flavorful and tender. However, Ive gotten chicken that tasted just as good from a Peruvian chicken place for a 1/4 of the price. Others in my party got the suckling pig and the special of pigeon and were pleased. Its nice for a special occasion but a little too pricey for my taste., Very fun place. An oasis in party-centric Adams Morgan.The food is creative and tasty. Service was just right, timely, but let you enjoy your food too. Grilled octopus appetizer and pork for two were the highlights. Cant wait to go back and try more of the interesting menu.
46|mythology-washington|I had the opportunity to pop in during the H-Street Festival, as I saw balloons & a patio celebration saying Welcome, Please Come In. Since I didn eat & only enjoyed a glass of wine, my review is based on the very friendly customer service that I experienced from the Bartender, Server & Owner.Without being a foodie photo bomber, I did eye hustle different plates that were going around, as Mythology created a special festival menu. Some of the offerings were Ham & Cheese Waffle Bites, Blackened Shrimp Po-Boy & creative Frites being their specialty item. Montreal-Black Pepper & BBQ Sauce, & Bloody Mary-Creamy Horseradish Sauce are few of the options that come dust or smothered. Even with my simple glass of Vino-$8, the Bartender was cool in sharing the new business insight while he servicing the thirsty festive attendees. They do offer a full bar, probably sits 10 people & has 2 TV.The space is nicely compacted depth wise, bar in the corner, mini tables on a bi-level platform & an enormous window view of the patio/street. The d39cor is amazing with a color pallete of floating clouds & an accent wall with an array of images reflecting various myths. There a set of stairs that I did not venture up, yet will make a bet that it leads to an upper deck or restrooms.I met the Owner (Tom?) who stated this was not a soft opening, more so a come see the latest restaurant/bar to hit the H-Street Corridor. Again, although I was not dining in or throwing them back at the bar, I was greeted by one of the Server seeking if I could use anything else. That great customer service & super price point, has me looking forward to returning for a complete dining experience. & hopefully not changing my rating., So the true opening was tonight so the wife, a long lost friend and I met up for dinner.Wow... definitely one of the best meals we have had in a while!We did stop in this weekend during H St Festival for some frites and cocktails, which were quite good but we wanted to experience their full menu and it didn disappoint. Hold on... I do have to mention the cocktails are quite creative! For dinner we started with the puff pastries and the French Onion frites to start. The pastries are basically little sandwiches with beef or pork with a small amount of salad/slaw in the middle. I recommend putting a bit of the salad on your mini sandwich. I liked the pork better. Wife and friend liked the beef better.I enjoyed the French Onion frites so much I decided to order their S&P frites, which are salt and pepper... and they came in a giant red head with fries for brains! I think they could have been a little less salty but the dipping sauce really balanced it out but the addition of the pepper was really great.We ordered two entrees... the steak and the But I a Vegetarian. To our surprise the steak came with Mjolnir and bone marrow (not kidding), which wasn on the menu but my wife was delighted (with the marrow... I was about the hammer)! The steak was done medium rare just as ordered and quite tasty. The surprise stand out was the vegetarian dish. It was a combination of vegetables with a curry including cauliflower I think, mushrooms and chick peas (also tomatoes and others). The chick peas still had just a bit of firmness so Al Dente? but the curry was so balanced the flavors of the vegetables still came out and was truly a wonderful dish. This is a very welcome addition to H St. It definitely has the makings of a destination restaurant and I encourage you all to find time to pay them a visit., Only had drinks but they were both good! I got Mercurys vespa and it was awesome. Vodka, gin, prosecco, grapefruit, and honey. Yummy and strong!!, Great new place. Cool design with cloud lights providing mellow lighting. Fusion menu with some interesting new combinations, cold beer glasses always a nice touch, French onion fries were amazing -- after I shoveled all of those into my mouth, I moved on to the crab toast -- which the table devoured, sushi was really fresh, and presentation of the food follows the restaurant theme. Definitely a good addition to the Atlas District., SUMMARY: Went to Mythology on a Saturday during it opening week. It provides a definitively different atmosphere than your typical new DC restaurants filled with hardwood and microbrews and they did some things very well, and other things need some work. Go here for drinks or late night snacks, specifically the frites, but the entrees could use some work.AMBIANCE: The first thing you notice when you walk in here is the ceiling lights that are made to look like clouds flickering lightning. Feels like the kind of decor you find in LA and felt a little cheesy/cheap for the prices and clientele they were offering. Not to mention it didn provide what I actually needed which was light. Hard for me to order food if I can barely read the menu. However once the lounge opens upstairs I could see this place being a favorite of those who favor the big city lounge atmosphere. The fact that the windows open out to the street is a nice touchDRINKS: Let start with their strong suit. The custom cocktail menu was spot on. We had the Revenant and their take on the classic Vespa and they were excellent. The wine list had an ample selection as well though the red wine was served quite warm. Many people assume red wine should be served at room temperature but that not the case. A wine fridge would probably be a good investment.FOOD: Frites: What will ultimately become the late night draw for this place will likely be their Frites menu. They serve them dusted and smothered in a variety of versions and the dusted Frites arrive in a giant human bust. Sadly the smothered frites do not but they offer a much messier option so probably for the best. We went with the Feta Frites on the waitresses suggestion and they were passable, and we regretted not getting the Bulgogi frites every time one walked by.Sushi Salad: It comes in a square on a bed of rice and is basically sashimi, rice, some uninspiring pickled vegetables, and allegedly seaweed though I had a hard time picking out the flavor profile. I had high hopes for this and it didn deliver.Rock the Fish Please: I recommend this dish if you do eat here, it was well done, had nice texture and layering and was a good portion size and well balanced. The fish was crispy on one side and paired nicely with the broth and corn.Mojo Pork: I had high hopes for this as well and was left disappointed. Ultimately you get two pieces of tough, slightly dry spiced pork tenderloins atop braised pork shoulder that really feels more like BBQ. The mustard was minimally present and I think it was missing some sort of vegetable accompaniment that the lackluster leafy greens didn provide. It also arrived on a plate with a giant hammer attached to it (I assume because Thor?) which obstructed my view of my date and was a little uncomfortable to eat around.STAFF: The staff was lovely and attentive, didn rush us, and we had an opportunity to speak with the owner about his plans hopes for the space and upstairs lounge and eventual roof deck. All in all Il probably come back to see how the lounge turns out and hope that it ends up attracting a slightly more mature crowd that you get at places like H Street Country Club and Rock and Roll Hotel., While it still isn officially opened, I highly recommend checking it out. Service was fantastic - particularly for a new restaurant. I normally avoid new places for a few months so they can work out the kinks but that was not case here. Cocktails were spot-on and the frites selection was great -- we had the bulgogi and pastrami smothered fries. In our group, 2 had the pork, 1 had the steak and I had the fish. Everyone loved their selection - the crispiness of the skin on the fish was some of the best I have had. My only ding is that it could have come with a bit more she-crab broth. We then split 2 desserts - the French toast and the Creme br3bl39e and iced coffee pudding -- both were excellent. Can wait to go back when the lounge is open., It was my brothers birthday last week so decided to celebrate belated birthday this Sunday with a brunch in the H neighborhood.My first time @ Mythology, I must say folk are extremely cordial perhaps coz they are brand new. Anyway, coming to food not too many options for brunch. The place is famous for frites. They were accommodating to create the smothered frites with crab off of their dinner menu. It was yummy. But we already had dusted feta frites..it was all one too many for the month!!! Crab toast was ok. Monkey bread too sweet and too dry. It should come with a dipping sauce. (Took it to-go...at home...surprisingly it was quite a combo with melted coffee ice cream!!...). Drinks were ok. Overall..nothing overly brunchy ...way too pricey. Felt like over-priced bar food !! Points for presentation and excellent glass and silverware. Decor is unique with clouds hanging from the ceiling complete with thunder and lightening sound effects. The ambience itself does not look fine dining per se. Perhaps I will give it another go n try some real food this time!, Awesome food served in a whimsical way (plates that have a huge hammer of Thor or Zeus lightning bolt coming out of them). Its fun, but not cheezy. . I highly recommend the smoked pineapple cocktail on the drink side or the Syrah that we got a bottle of. On the food side, the korean style beef kalbi was excellent as was the pork dish. For dessert, I really liked the coffee and tea.Place has a fun, but elegant vibe to it. Im going back for sure.
47|nopa-kitchen-bar-washington|I cant really write a conclusive review about the newest adventure of DCs favorite brown restaurateur as I only had dessert and a cappuccino, having stumbled on it while looking for an aesthetically pleasing place to get coffee. The waiter came around and informed us that it was opening night. I hope some of the other diners present tonight will contribute their take on the experience. It should be noted that the views are pretty great, and the interior decor oozes a kind of postmodern weirdness. Its halfway between the kind of faux-industrial loft-esque look and an endearing minimalist elegance. One could stare at those wooden floors for a long time. But then there are also hints of classicism in some luxurious chairs and an unfortunately dirty mirror. Maybe it was intentionally dirty. Bad housekeeping or hipster art? Well never know... (is there a difference between the two?) Some ugly whitewashed brick walls were saved only by the wine racks adorning them. Still, despite some minor misgivings, the restaurant has a lovely sense of space and luxury going for it. The cappuccino was a cappuccino; wasnt really expecting my taste buds to get Gertrude Steind by it. A trusted friend with better taste for such things noted it was kind of mild. The banana trifle was a treat. Fresh and natural were the first things that came to mind. You will not find better cut, tastier banana slices anywhere. Some thaumaturgy is clearly at work. You can bet that the Hutzler 571 was put to good use in this establishment. Jamilla (apparently that is her name) has been thoroughly trained with one, I was assured. God forbid such powerful tools find themselves in the wrong hands. 9 dollars is maybe a *tad* pricey for the trifle, but still well within the range of reason given the spectacular quality. A couple of tables over, some people had ordered coffee and the waiters brought out two pristine looking metal french presses. Seriously, they were shinier than the head of an effete balding man. Will probably go back and actually try the food, but I had good first impressions., We went on Saturday night for dinner. It was great. The brussels sprouts and the gnocchi to start were awesome. Perfect beginning to the meal. We also ordered the cauliflower and it was just ok. Graffiato has much more noteworthy cauliflower. For our entrees, I ordered the pork chop and mmmmmmm. It was so good. My husbands hanger steak was also awesome. Our friends had the short rib sandwich and the sea bass, both delicious. For dessert, we had the frozen chocolate bar thing. It was delicious. Cold, nutty, crunchy. Yum. The cocktails, especially the Derby, were also phenomenal, and at $10 a piece, they were a nice departure from the $14-$16 cocktail trend. We will definitely be going back. This was a 4.5 star experience. Enjoy!, Creative fare with a nice vibe., They call themselves an American-style French brasserie, whatever that means, but it works. Sleek but warm decor. Very good cocktails--the NoPa Punch was a refreshing standout. The Chilean sea bass was one of the best pieces of fish weve ever had. Not quite Rasika black cod-level, but up there. The rest of the food was good to very good but nothing else transcendent like the sea bass. Cant go wrong with the pork chop, though. Deserts (the Banana Trifle and the Maple Buns) were also noteworthy and good-sized portions for a place like this. Service was very friendly and helpful, but the kitchen got food out very slowly. Still working out the kinks, I guess, but thats to be expected for being open only a few days. Overall, a solid addition to the restaurant scene in Penn Quarter., I have a groupie crush on Ashok Bajaj so I hate to do this but I have to. I had the hamachi app and the soft shell crab app. both were so average. just not good. enjoyed the cocktails, great service, love the space, theyve done a nice job with transforming the former Zola space...but unfortunately, 2 too average apps earns them a 3 star review. i will definitely try it out again if i see better experiences here..., I went here for lunch yesterday and I got the buger, my sister got the bbq chicken salad hero, and my friend got the short rib sandwich. The best part of my meal was the bread they bring you in the beginning. The burger was well done even though I ordered it medium. I would have sent it back but we were on a time crunch since we all had to get back to work. When i cook, even if I overcook my burgers by acccident, the meat itself still has a lot of flavor. Not so much with this one. It literally tastes like a frozen patty you get at Shoppers Food Warehouse that you stick directly on the grill. At least then, it may have some charcoal flavor! The fries were also cold when they came but I imagine if they were piping hot, theyd be delicious. My sisters and friends food was good, especially the chicken salad sandwich. Overall, my experience was meh. With so many delicious options around Penn Quarter itd be hard to get me to come back here., We stopped in for a quite bite on sunday night and were impressed. Overall, both the food and service were excellent.beet soup - excellentmeatball starter - excellentburger - excellent chicken sandwich - very goodstrawberry pies - superb, Normally we will wait to try newly-opened restaurants until they work out the operational kinks, but we tried Nopa this weekend based on a few very good initial reviews. We were highly impressed. The food was fantastic. We ordered the meatball appetizer and the salmon and rockfish main entrees with a side of brussel sprouts. All were cooked perfectly, lots of flavor, etc. . It seemed like staff outnumbered diners 2-to-1. Clearly NoPa is prioritizing service to avoid negative perceptions out of the gate. Hope they keep it up. We look forward to eating there again., Heard great things about them so was excited to try this new restaurant. For a new restaurant, it was running very smoothly. For a Monday night, they were pretty packed as well. LOVE the $10 cocktails. $10 is still pricey but for downtown DC, it almost feels like a steal. I had the Oregon pinot girs ($8) and would highly recommend it! Got sat once everyone in my party arrived. I love windows, so appreciated how the walls were glass and I could see outside. Love me some natural light. I didnt quite get why they dimmed the light so much though. I could barely see my friends mid dinner.I always love a restaurant that offers a bread basket - their garlic-y bread was amazing. We ordered the frisee salad, meatballs, brussel sprouts, sea bass and pork chop, and everything was very tasty. My only disappointment would be the pork chop was supposed to come with a kale salad which turned out to be more of a garnish beneath the pork chop, than a side to go with my pork chop. If we didnt have the brussel sprouts, Id literally just be eating the meat with nothing else.Id definitely go back, the server wasnt really memorable, but I had a pleasant experience in general., NoPa recently opened, so I was slightly nervous to try the place knowing they were still working out the kinks of the menu but regardless my overall all experience was a 3.5. Let start with drinks: Our table ordered the Chinatown Shake & French 75. One word: EXCELLENT! The Chinatown Shake ingredients on NoPa website were different, but our Chinatown Shake was composed on Tito, Strawberry, and Basil. It lovely! For dinner our tabled ordered:1.) Baby Beet and Mandarin Orange Salad, Aged Goat Cheese and Black Truffle Vinaigrette2.) Smoked Salmon Croquettes3.) Crispy Soft-Shell Crab with Avocado Basil Pur39e4.) Mussels, Mushroom Broth, Fresh Chiles served with Grilled Sourdough5.) NoPa Burger, Irish White Cheddar, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Fries6.) Crispy Brussel Sprouts, Pear and SesameStarting with the Baby Beet Salad it was good, missing the goat cheese component. I understand its not part of the dish, but could have brought this dish completely together. Next, Salmon Croquettes were ok, very dill flavored. For the Soft-Shell Crab, was good but the Avocado Basil Pur39e with the dish was great. I do feel this dish will be even better later in the summer versus now. As for the Mussels, not my favorite in DC but I had to try for the mushroom broth and fresh chiles favor combo. It a delicate flavor with the mussels, but there could have been a few more chiles. For the NoPa Burger, it decent but I actually curious if the burger is only cow or combo of a few ground meats? I was not impressed with the bun they served the burger on, it looked like any other roll you would buy in the grocery store. So, hopefully in the next few months they could develop the hamburger roll to infuse herbs to balance the burger aspect of the dish. Finally, the Brussel Sprouts = GREAT! Loved the prep and the flavor was well-balanced.Though I did give NoPa a 3.5, I do expect it to consistently receive 4 and 5 stars as it matures and further develop their menu items. Service was on point and d39cor is industrial and modern which I like with plenty of room around the tables for customers to enjoy their meals & conversations.Right now, my recommendation is to give NoPa a month or two more to work out their menu, but I would not shy away from NoPA for having drinks with friends and having a few small plates, first date, or going before an event at Verizon Center. Will I go back - YES!, So we were hesitant to go so shortly after its opening and the name, come on. Wow, we were glad we did. First the service. Stephanie was our waitress and she was awesome. In addition to great service and menu recommendations, she also provided a bit of stand up and arranged for a tour of the private dining spaces after we finished our meal. And the food, what an improvement from Zola that previously occupied this prime real estate. The food was amazing. We started with meatballs, the melt in your mouth kind. I had the sea bass and it is all that, as were the brussels sprouts. My husband had the hangar steak and it didnt disappoint. Cocktails and wine list also very good. Dont let the name stop you. Check this place out, its legit., I went to dinner here for the first time with my Partner and his mother and father. The food was amazing, the service wonderful (Thanks Stephani!) and the decor was rich with a smell of new leather. I had the pork chop, which was succulent, and it was mixed with spiced pear and some kale. It was magnificent. Also worth noting was the fried strawberry pie. It will blow your mind! This is definitely a great place for a quiet dinner with friends and family. Good food, good ambiance, and great service. A definite recommend., After hearing some good things about Nopa Kitchen + Bar from the Spring Dining Guide in the Post and from Yelp, we decided wed check it out. Both my wife and I had been to Zola before, which Nopa has taken over the space and liked it, but I have to say, Nopa has made Zola look outdated, the new look has more of a modern, but still casual elegance - great aesthetic.We both started out with a cocktail, I had the 800 F & Tonic which was delicious. We split the Gnocchi as an appetizer (half-order, which was plenty for two) and it was delicious - great flavor, soft pasta, a real hit. Lets not forget about the bread, the olive-oil roll is delicious, you dont even need to add butter! My wife had the Chilean Sea Bass and I had the hanger steak. The Sea Bass was very good and flavorful, maybe a bit too sweet...it had an almost Teriyaki taste to it, it was a bit too sweet for my wifes taste, I enjoyed some bites of it but was still a little too sweet for my taste, but definitely not bad. The hanger steak was very good, simple with onions on top and the fries were good as well.We had ordered a bottle of wine to go with our dinner, the sommelier came back and informed us that they were out of it and we made the decision to go with a Malbec. When the sommelier came back, he gave us a very good background on the winemaker and the wine we were about to drink, along with the lower and more upscale vintages of the same winemaker. Further, a different waiter than ours noticed we were drinking the Malbec and came over to tell us it was one of his favorites and made some suggestions about another winemaker in Argentina. He provided lots of information on wine and then had another server come over who knew the name of a Malbec producer that was very well liked. It was an extremely nice touch to have two waiters that werent ours take time to talk to us about our wine choice and to provide recommendations on others we might like.The food was very good, not perfect, but its still a new restaurant so I give them a break but the knowledgeable and helpful staff helped seal the deal. Well definitely return soon., You can tell the restaurant is super eager with its new opening. Lunch was fully staffed. Each sip of water almost got a comical refill. The savory briochy muffin in the bread basket was super tasty. I had the Vegetarian Bahn Mi with a side of baby greens. Great flavors, although not crazy about the sea salt in the salad, but then again, Im not a salt-lover. The kitchen was a little slow but thats to be expected during the busy lunch. Would give this a try again., NoPa is definitely a vast improvement over its predecessor, Zola! First, the atmosphere is amazing (even down to the bathrooms!) -- sleek and yet both inviting and comfortable. The brasserie is serving up some pretty tasty food (I especially recommend the salmon, the crispy brussel sprouts, and the free bread basket - lol!) and drinks too. This is most definitely a place that Id recommend that you visit to help welcome its arrival to the neighborhood!, Great food, beautiful space, top notch staff. Another standout experience from Ashok Bajaj. Two very good meals so far, both dinner. Salmon, mussels, sea bass, rockfish, octopus - all excellent., Went to NoPa on a whim this past Friday night with my girlfriend and her parents. Im glad we did. It was absolutely amazing!First off, the restaurant is beautiful. Ive always loved the location and large windows, but as others have pointed out, NoPa has done a great job of taking this space and giving it a fresh/modern look. I should also mention our server was fantastic. I cant recall his name, but I do remember hes Serbian. Super funny, super attentive and clearly enjoys his job and understand food.As for the food, what can I say, it was amazing. I had a hamachi tartar appetizer with my girlfriend to start. The fish was prepared perfectly, as a tartar should be. But you can tell theyre using fresh, sushi grade hamachi. My main course was the steak frites. I get this dish a lot whenever I see it on a menu, so I like to believe Im a good judge of a quality steak frites. NoPA served up the best in DC as far as Im concerned. I could go on and on, but I think Ive said all you need to hear. NoPa is a fantastic choice for a great meal in DC. I will certainly be back., Wow! What a wonderful upgrade from Zola! The decor is warm yet semi-industrial, and overall very chic. In spite of the number of diners, we found the noise level to be quite reasonable. Ask for a booth - theyre quite comfy! My friends and I had a lovely experience here. Initial service (water, drink orders, etc.) was unbelievably prompt and friendly which kicked off our nice dinner quite well. For starters, the bread basket they bring you is delicious. The popover-style rolls (topped with herbs!) were addictive. (More DC restaurants should serve popovers, dammit!)They bake these fresh all night, so dont be shy in asking for a bread basket refill.For dinner I ordered the Parisienne Gnocchi, which unlike traditional gnocchi is made from flour (p32te 30 choux to be exact), not potatoes. (See Pic.) The result? Light, fluffy pillows of deliciousness -in a very simple sauce. The mushrooms in the dish were great, but it could have used a bit more arugula (just my preference though). My friends LOVED their frisee salad, vegetarian bahn mi, and burgers respectively. For dessert, the Chocolate Bar caught our eye and we were treated to a sweet and salty chocolate and toffee mousse-like dessert. Heavenly!If you havent been, head over to NoPa for a fun summer dinner soon!, When we first walked into NoPa we found it to have a wonderful ambiance and especially loved the bar area. Very open and beautiful. The 800 F G&T, made w/ homemade tonic infused w/ lavender and ginger was outstanding. My new favorite cocktail. We arrived just as they opened on Sunday as we had a theater engagement at Woolly Mammoth at 7pm. Right around the corner, so very convenient. Our waiting quickly appeared to offer tap or bottled water, but after he brought the water he was absent for a long time, and ultimately I had to ask someone to ask him to come take our order. Beyond that, service was prompt, and he made note of the fact we were on a tight time frame to be out in time for the show. The brussel sprouts were some of the best Ive ever had, the skirt steak was good, but nothing special. The skate was underwhelming, and my dining partner thought it had an ammonia taste, which is often indicative of old fish. I didnt pick up on that flavor and believe it may have been due to the rhubarb in the sauce. It is not a dish either of of would choose again. While the food we had, other than the brussel sprouts was not anything to recommend, we both agreed we would give it another try as the menu has many interesting offerings, and I have read positive reviews of some of the other items on the menu. I would definitely stop in for another one of those G&Ts!!, 3.5 stars. I was really looking forward to trying this place because I love Rasika and figured NoPa would be just as impressive. It was good, but I wasnt blown away. The service was excellent. Our waiter was really friendly and knowledgeable about the food. We ordered a bunch of small plates to share so we could try as many things as possible. I also started with their spicy brasserita, which is a margarita with habanero syrup in it. It was really good. The bread they give you is also excellent. Its pull-apart bread with herbs in it, and its served warm - yum! For our entrees/small plates, we got the blue cheese fondue, the bibb salad, smoked salmon croquettes, heirloom carrots, and the Parisienne gnocchi. The blue cheese fondue was very good, but I thought it could have come with some better dippers. The gnocchi was also very good. The smoked salmon croquettes, the bibb salad, and the carrots were less memorable. The desserts were great. We got the strawberry pies and the sticky bun. The sticky bun was amazing! Overall, the best things were the cocktail, the bread, and the desserts. I might go back for drinks, but wouldnt rush back for dinner., Our server Stephanie, was excellent and fun, she made great recommendations. The rockfish was delicious., Epic! In reverse order.Desserts: blackberry crumble with sweet corn ice cream. Amazing flavor, better than the sum of its parts. Cherry pies with Mackinac Island Fudge. Blown away. Great crust, amazing true Michigan flavors. This round moved me; dessert tends to flop, and here dessert carried a giant-ass Gandalfesque staff of light. Proud to have a fellow Michigander at the pastry helm. Round 3: blue cheese fondue and the Brussel sprouts with sesame pear. Fondue was what you expect - good but not magical. Brussel sprouts were my childhood nemesis, but had my mom been a world class chef at NoPa, their place in my life would have been elevated. Yum!Round 2: meatballs, duck confit and octopus. The meatballs were expertly made but lacked sparkle. What is sparkle? What the meatballs didnt have. Alton calls it umami. Maybe MSG? The duck confit was what I wished was served at all church potlucks: crispy, juicy fall-off-the-bone tender perfection. The octopus was really great too, tender and just the ideal amount of chew, slightly distracted by bits of some fruit, though that added a hint of sweet acid.Round 1: Fight! Blue Point, RI Oysters on the half shell. The mignonette was fine, more tangy than most but good. The bomb was the Fresno chili vinagrette - smooth!! Chilies, grapeseed oil, salt and vinegar. Genius in simplicity, mastery in execution.Nick was a great waiter on top of it all! Tuesday night was a bit slow, so maybe we got more attention than other nights. Irregardlessly sic it was a great night of culinary delight.What, too cheesy? ;-), I came here about two months ago for dinner with a friend and had the most wonderful time! The ambiance is great, young and lively and the interior is beautiful. I sat at a four top by a window, and I am not one of those camper diners who sits for hours and we somehow were there for 3! I must have really enjoyed myself :)Onto the drinks. I heard the cocktails were a must-try so I opted for the 800 F and Tonic while my friend sipped on the French 75. While both were great, hers was fantastic and fresh tasting!For dinner we decided to share a few dishes, but before I begin, the bread basket is AMAZING which I always think is a good indicator of the restaurant. Onto the appetizers:-Crispy soft-shell crab with avocado basil puree (UNREAL)-Ancho chili glazed baby back ribs (SUPER TASTY)-Spring radish salad (could have skipped)As an entree we ordered the chilean seabass and shared the side of brussel sprouts. The chilean seabass was one of the best Ive ever had, cooked perfectly, the flavor was absolutely outstanding and I loved the eggplant with it. The brussel sprouts (which my friend has to order everywhere she goes) were actually quite interesting, the pear and sesame was a new twist that Ive never had before and it definitely worked.Last but CERTAINLY NOT LEAST the dessert! UGH. We shared the fried pies (which at the time were strawberry) with fromage blanc ice cream, the banana trifle and the chocolate hazelnut bar which both arent on the menu at the moment :(. Quite unfortunate because that banana dessert was top notch, I hope it makes a comeback. All in all, great dining experience here and would love to come back for lunch., Pros:StylishThe server StephanieCons:LOUD! No more than 8 tables with people and I had to shout to be heard by my company.Water glasses should be distinguishable between sparkling and tap so they dont keep trying to put tap in your sparkling.Wine was served chilled! We ordered a pino noir, it was served way too cold! Could have been a nice bottle!No specialsOur server, I dont even remember his name, was almost a figment of my imagination.Food, rockfish was cooked great but the only taste I could taste was a strong herb! My friend ordered the burger and fries, burger was good and fries tasted like they were cooked in salt oil! Saving grace:The server Stephanie was amazingly pleasant, she and only she is the reason Id ever recommend this place ! Make sure to as for Stephanie if you do decide to go down this pathetic path., Nopa is beautifully decorated and the service is exceptional. I would recommend making reservations here for a special occasion because the maitred, host/hostess and servers will all treat you like youre the only one in the restaurant! The bar would be great for a date because they have cozy little nooks. The menu was good but my meal wasnt amazing enough to rate this place 5 stars. I would return though., Lets start on a positive note. The food was great! Fantastic bread basket and we were there for the restaurant week lunch which was a great deal. I chose the p32t39, skate, and sorbet and honestly couldnt find anything wrong with any of those dishes. Now onto the service. We were there while the restaurant was about half full. We had a well behaved 10 year old with us. When told there was no childrens menu we decided that we would all simply share our lunches with the child. So after we told the waiter our plan he looked confused and walked off. Seconds later a man whom Im assuming was the manager (he didnt identify himself) came over to the table to tell us that if we werent ordering off the restaurant week menu we couldnt sit in the main dining room (in a condescending tone nonetheless). We asked him if he really expected a 10 year old to eat three courses and ensured him that the rest of us ordered off the restaurant week menu. He said ok and walked away. The interaction with him and the waiters lack of service for the rest of the meal really put a damper on our lunch. Sadly I dont think well be back due to the managements behavior., I went here for Restaurant Week since this is a new spot on DCs burgeoning food scene. Arriving for my reservation at noon, I stepped into a well-lit, modern, stylish dining area with dark wood tables and cushy booth/chair seating. The atmosphere seemed nice upon initial impression, however I quickly noticed the restaurant becomes very loud even when its not completely filled. It got even worse as more diners arrived that it became difficult to hear what my dining companion was saying at the table. Not a dealbreaker, but definitely something that stood out. Service was fine.As for the food, I ordered the meatballs appetizer, porchetta sandwich entree, and chocolate bar dessert. Meatballs and kale were fairly delicious though I would have liked more spice and served at a hotter temperature. The porchetta sandwich was a good size, very filling, though not something I found to be exceptional. The meat was a tad dry. It is not something I would normally order at a restaurant, perhaps only as a less costly lunch to bring back to my desk. The chocolate bar was decent, though somewhat dry and crumbly. Ive had far more memorable chocolate desserts at other restaurants.Overall, nopa deserves three stars because it provides a nice dining atmosphere with good, though not exceptional food. It aspires to be a top restaurant but falls short of greatness in my opinion. I would not say it is bad, but a relatively safe, boring choice. There are plenty of more interesting and better restaurants in DC., I went in with pretty high expectations. This area is full of great restaurants and Ive had great experiences at Jaleo, La Tasca, and of course nearby Zaytinya.The restaurant is attractive: handsome flooring, very comfortable seating, clean lighting (although not plentiful...it felt very dark). Our server was great throughout our meal and interaction with staff overall was pleasant.When the reservation was made, my friend indicated there was a vegan dining in our party. *Hand raised*. Our server let us know he spoke with the chef who indicated that the first three appetizers as well as the vegetable option on the Restaurant Week menu could be prepared vegan. I REALLY appreciated this extra step in advance of my arrival -- he won big points.I had the El Diablo cocktail which was sweet, spicy, strong, clean, and fresh tasting. One of the best cocktails Ive had recently.I ordered the gazpacho to start and wasnt very impressed. It tasted fresh, but lacked an acidic finish as the flavor fell flat. The textural element, a parmesan crouton, was simply left off and not substituted with anything.The vegetable entree arrived, and my portion was noticeably smaller than anyone elses. It was really uncomfortable. I dont need a HUGE plate of food, but this was dismal at best. 2 tablespoons of black quinoa, a small helping of mushrooms (which were delicious, well seasoned) and a heavy spoonful of corn and diced carrots that literally looked like a frozen vegetable mix from a bag. Had I paid $18-25 for this plate, which I likely would have had to outside of the RW set menu, I would have been REALLY pissed. The fruit dessert was another disappointment. While I really enjoyed the sorbet (blackberry, I believe) the cantaloupe pieces were those unfortunate ones close to the peel that you generally throw away when cutting it up. No one at a restaurant wants to bite into a tough, bitter piece of cantaloupe twice.A restaurant with this ambiance and prices needs to do much better., I do like the decor of the place, but this is a restaurant so well focus on food. We came here for Restaurant Week (RW), in my past experience, most restaurants will change up to a whole different menu to work with RW, Nopa is no exception, so we were given the RW menu (3 courses). The roll they served was amazing, I asked for a second basket! So we had country pate and baby back ribs for appetizer, Im not a big pate fan, so I wont comment on that, the bf seemed to enjoy it. The baby back rib was pretty good. We got Porchetta sandwich and Hanger Steak for entree, the porchetta sandwich was ok, the steak on the other hand, it was cooked to our liking. We ended up sharing the steak and left the sandwich alone. It wasnt bad just the steak was better. There are only 4 choices for dessert, I had the fresh fruit salad with sorbet, it was a bit too much fresh mint and verbena for me. The milk and cookie on the other hand, the chocolate cookie has a little peppermint in it and the chocolate milk has a ball of peppermint ice cream in it. Overall, I wasnt too impressed with the meal but it was bad. I learned that their happy hour is half price on some of the drinks, so I would probably return for the happy hour., Visit Nopa last night for restaurant week, and it was a great experience overall. I read some mixed reviews here, and I can say with confidence that whatever early opening jitters there were are no more. I chose Nopa because it was the only RW menu I read that actually provided a multitude of choices instead of three random choices for app, main and dessert. In addition to the great $35 value for three courses, they also did a special on wine for $30, so we opted for a nice Malbec to complement our meal. A smart way to get us to spend a little more and enjoy a whole bottle with our meal!Ambiance is top-notch. The bar features leather sofas and chairs in the front surrounded by windows. The bar is beautiful and makes you feel cool just to chill out there in advance of your meal. Exposed brick and big round lamp lighting add a modern edge to the look. Lots of round tables available for groups, which I love.Food was excellent...Appetizers: baby back ribs in ancho chili glaze (they use GF soy sauce, yay), and baby lettuces in champagne vinegrette. Ribs were delicious...the right amount of sauce and smokey-nessMain Course: roasted chicken with sweet corn, smoked mushrooms, fresno chile vinegrette was a generous portion, maybe a little dry in some parts, but they made up for it with the most juicy and delicious parts, and crispy skin. The sea bass was well worth the additional $4 with japanese eggplant and wasabi pea puree. The pea puree was sweet and delicious and the perfect complement to a succulent piece of sea bass with a nice char on top. It was cooked perfectly. Dessert: I am always surprised when dessert is so unique and also quite good. We had the lemon verbena panna cotta topped with blueberries and the blackberry violet sorbet with summer fruit macedoine. Both were excellent. The sorbet was delicious and fresh, the fruit was yummy and some mint in there balanced the sweetness. I loved the panna cotta...fruity and creamy.All in all, it was a great first time and a homerun considering it was restaurant week. I look forward to many hungry returns., Went here for Restaurant week and had high expectations being a Bajaj restaurant (also owns Rasika and BombayClub). However, we were very disappointed.The food was extremely bland..had no taste whatsoever. The chicken was dry and none of their entrees were standing out. Bread is extremely loaded with butte. Service was decent and location is excellent,I wouldnt eat here again.., Really yummy everything...cocktails...1st course..the decor and the service was pretty amazing...would definitely go back again., When you choose to go to a restaurant, there is a journey taken for the small amount of time that you relinquish control of your evening. NOPA is like a ship without a rudder. The menu while eclectic too broad of strokes to capture anyones attention. The interior design was sleek and interesting but had no real central theme. I ordered only a few things and was rather unimpressed with everything. The carrot salad with yogurt was rather piled up like a mound of fries. WAY TOO acidic overdressed with vinegar not enough salt and the yogurt was rather unmemorable. Could not get over the rather uninspiring entrees so made my way to the more uninspiring dessert menu. Ordered the lemon verbena panna cotta which had good flavor but also had a rather loose consistency for a panna cotta. I also ordered the madeleines which was the resturants one saving grace. I would like to have liked this restaurant but without any really stellar dishes and everything looking rather run of the mill I have to say that I will not be returning. Enjoy the scene inside the dining area, its beautiful but without the touch of gastronomic excellence I doubt that this place will do very well. But what do I know this place has 4 stars on Yelp? Cheers and happy eats!, While the atmosphere is great, the food at Nopa is embarrassingly bad. The menu is questionable, but we hoped preparation and quality of ingredients could make up for it. We were sourly disappointed. The blue cheese fondue is warm blue cheese dressing, best with apple but served with little of it. The brussel sprouts in a peach, pecan vinaigrette were burned and soaked in an emulsified, creamy rather than light dressing that did not have a hint of peach or pecan. The manager claimed this was a favorite dish, but either those who have enjoyed it must have held their noses or well benefitted from the bar beforehand. The dish left an awful lasting taste. The salmon was dry and fishy. We returned our food and left to get pizza., There is much to commend this restaurant. The interior is contemporary chic, service is prompt, and the menu has lots of interesting choices. The location can make it a difficult evening booking particularly when the Verizon Center, the Shakespeare Theatre and the Woolly Mammoth are all running performances. Our initial attempt to get in after a Shakespeare Theatre performance soon after it opened was not successful though, admittedly, we had a group of 10 and a lot of places would rather not deal with that size a group. We had more success during a recent restaurant week foray. The baby beet and mandarin orange salad was an interesting combination. Beets are such an assertive vegetable and they tend to overwhelm other more nuanced flavors and such was the salad. The flavor of the mandarin orange was lost between the pronounced flavors of the beets and the vinaigrette - ok if you like beets (I do) but still a disappointment. The roasted chicken was quite successful. The smoked mushrooms combined with the saut39ed sweet corn (along with sugar snap peas) was a wonderful combination. The smokiness of the mushrooms married well with the corn and the roast chicken. The combination - crispy roasted chicken skin, firm but soft earthy mushrooms and slightly al dente corn and sugar snaps created a medley of interesting textures. Finally, the chocolate bar was a good desert. The accompanying dulce de leche sauce was a polite whisper on the plate: enough to let you know it was good but not enough to actually enjoy with the chocolate bar. Other members of our party were happy with their choices (gazpacho, salmon among others). We were greeted upon entering and seated promptly. Service was good and observant: our beverages were filled at just the right moments without having to ask. This restaurant is another one worth trying if you happen to be in the area. The availability of salads and sandwiches on the menu allows one to enjoy the experience without breaking the bank., Had a good experience here. Nice atmosphere and decor, not too noisy. For the food, the skate was amazing (it was also recommended by the server) - nice and flaky with a light sauce. The prime rib eye, had mixed reviews on this, considering that its on the more expensive side of the menu, would have expected a little less fat on it. But overall it was tasty. Happy with the wine selection and quality. Very courteous service here, I would definitely keep this place on my list to return to for dinner in Penn Quarter., The decor was nice, and was better than I was expecting considering the location. The service was very good and attentive...my water never went empty. I had the vegetarian bahn mi and the brussels sprouts. DO NOT get the bahn mi. It is literally shredded vegetables on bread. They have a pretty good flavor but to call it a sandwich is a stretch. If youre not going to put meat on the bahn mi, there better be more to it. The brussels sprouts were fantastic. I would come back and definitely try some of the cocktails, but I think i will stay away from the sandwiches/mains. I think this place is overrated in its current state., Definitely overrated. the atmosphere and decor are fine. The service is fine, met expectations. The food though pretty much sucks. I had the short rib french dip. You think this is going to be some kind of new take on the sandwich, but its not. Its just a plain chopped pork BBQ sandwich with a little dish of some kind of jus. Its so heavy I was bloated for four hours and I barely ate half of it. My friend had the fried chicken. He barely ate half as well and felt disgusting also, it was so greasy he said. He also didnt like the brussel sprout side and hardly touched it. The only thing we agreed that we both liked were the french fries. Definitely skip this place, the menu is not inventive or interesting and the food is not executed well at all., Wow! NOPA really impressed. The chef and his/her kitchen are very talented. Indeed, the whole staff is attentive and respectful. My wife and I were celebrating her birthday and planned to see a concert afterwords. I made these notations in the reservation and the restaurant staff was fully prepared. The bar has a number of wines by the glass and several local and micro brews on tap like DC Brau, which I found to be delightfully hoppy. For dinner, we had the gnocchi for the first course, she had steak frits, and I had the sea bass. For desert, they surprised my wife with a glass of champagne and housed our donuts: very classy and I am grateful. Food was great, service was great, host was welcoming; it was one of the best meals we have shared together., Okay so this is a place i went to for brunch only hence the 4 stars. Appears to be french inspired but american oyster bar hybrid. 30 dollars you get 2 options from menu and bottomless mimosas. Really?So i had a frisse lardon salad and a country pate. They also offer croque madame and lobster salad sandwich. Yum, Ive been here twice now and both times I havent been disappointed. This used to be the home for Zola so I thought it might look the same, luckily it does not. I like the atmosphere way better than Zola, and the food is better too. Ive had the bass which is amazing, and so are the brussel sprouts. The staff is very friendly and not overbearing which is nice. I will be back, So, normally I would consider a 2-star rating an instant kibosh of the restaurant. I would go back to NoPa. But, only one one condition: on the way to the Verizon center. They serve up some tasty, high-quality cocktails, at an affordable rate compared to nearby locations. $10 for specialty cocktails, beer $6-$7. But in the end, the place is a catch-all for tourists, sporting events goers, and the wandering local looking for a place to catch a drink. Here are my points of interest:- delicious Vesper cocktail (and several others I will try some other time)- extremely tiny and not very good $15 hamachi tartar - twice-fried chicken which is delicious but should be under a different section than savory snacks - other savory snacks, market vegetables, and charcuterie which are good to enjoy with one or three cocktails.- an otherwise completely uninspiring menu which I chose to avoid completely., Excellent menu selections, good food, nice decor, attentive service., Just opened 3 days ago. We just had cocktails and the gnocchi which were good. Good service and atmosphere., What a great place!!! We had been wanting to come here since it opened, but we cannot keep track of all the great places opening. After a great evening last Friday filled with sushi and beer, we decided to stop at one last place, nopa. As always, we sat at the bar and was VERY enthusiastically greeted by Matt, our bartender. One of the best bartenders I have ever had. Definitely top 3, next to Nicole from New Heights/Gin Joint, and Lindsay and Jenny from Boundary road...so yeah. You better hope he is there when you plan your visit. Since we had already eaten an hour before, we decided to just have a cocktail here (although I did end up ordering and devouring the warm, marinated olives). We actually walked by earlier that afternoon, in hopes it would be open for happy hour, but they do not start their happy hour until later. So we went in search of a happy hour place before hand, deciding on RFD. When they were ready for happy hour, we happily headed that way and got a nice seat at the non-busy, but pleasant with buzz from a few bar patrons bar. The drinks were all enticing, and they were all 20% off for happy hour, so we finally decided on a sazerac for the husband (one of his favorite drinks), and I had a delicious cocktail with beer, called Blackwells Corruption. So GOOD! Matt was extremely friendly, and very actively involved with his bar patrons. And then we learned he was working a double and we were even more shocked at how pleasant he was considering. We chatted with a nice older couple from CA, in visiting the horse show and family, and they said they had dined here twice within the last 6 days, they loved it so much. The Brunch menu (and promotion on the chalk board at the bar) was very appealing and a great deal! We will MOST definitely return many times, for happy hour and brunch.Matt is the best, and this place is great. Inviting, modern, elegant, no loud music, great view with large windows and very close to the metro. Win, Win., Ok. I dont know why this place is only 3.5 stars. I had one of my better, more genuine meals here than I have had in a while for a DC restaurant. Its not really a 5 star place. But is 4.5 and so I will give it 5 to pull it up. Apps were not bad (gnocchi and poached octopus). Mains were fantastic (rib eye w mustard sauce and pork chop). The most important thing to say is that the fries were the best I have had since 1999 in Belgium. They could only have been better w some garlic mayo.The 2nd most important thing to say is that NoPa took this great location and fixed the major problem that Zola had...and that was the service. The service was excellent!They have a pre theater/game menu and I will be back often!, I have no idea why this has only 3 1/2 stars. We went with a group of six last night. They put us in a semi-private room without our even asking. The waiter was extremely attentive without being overbearing. And the food was outstanding. I started with the radish salad. There was some herb on it that was really unusual and just did an amazing job bringing out the different flavors. My husband had what looked like a frisee salad with large chunks of crisp bacon mixed in. For my entree, I had the seabass. It was meaty and flaky, with an unusual but delicious wasbi puree around it, plus some carmelized eggplant. Everyone at the table said their food was just really amazing. All very interesting and unique, but with all the flavors working together well. For dessert, my husband and I split the coconut chocolate thing. So good. Others at the table had the fried apple pies and also thought those were fantastic. While its not by any means a cheap restaurant, my husband and I both felt our meals were significantly better than most restaurants at the same price point. You could tell there was real effort and imagination put into every part of it., We found this on Yelp looking for something near the Spy Museum (its right next door). Service was superb. I went with my 13-year-old and they treated us very well. (Some places frown on kids even when well-behaved.) We had the pre-theater special, $34 for 3 courses plus a side for $7. We ordered the meatballs appetizer (delicious fresh tomato sauce), the hangar steak (prepared just right and flavorful sauce) and the chocolate caramel panna cotta for dessert (rich and yummy) and the Brussels sprouts as an extra side. It was more than enough for the two of us and they had no problems with that either. There were lots of wines by the glass to choose from and my Pinot Noir was wonderful. Theres valet parking for $10 and a nice bar if thats your thing., Have been here twice for dinner. Overall, the food was tasty. But this review is mostly based on the service.The first time we went on a Saturday night, and it was extremely packed. We waited over an hour for our meals. When we finally got our dinner, our food was only lukewarm and one of the people in my party complained to the waitress. They offered to take the food back but considering we waited so long, we all just dealt with it (it didnt seem so bad to me). Anyways, the waitress apologized several time, and the manager stopped by as well. They offered to comp the whole meal, which seemed unnecessary. When we refused, they gave us a $50 gift certificate to use and come back. Very nice.My second time for dinner I came back during the week. It was less crowded and we got our food in a normal amount of time.I would definitely come back, and was impressed with how much they cared that we enjoyed our meal. They went above and beyond to make sure we had a good experience. I would return, but maybe avoid a Friday or Saturday night at peak time., This place has been on my list for a while, ever since I heard it was from the same owners at Rasika. Unfortunately, I don know if I be back. While the service was incredibly attentive (my glass was never empty, the drinks kept flowing, and we even got some dessert for my birthday), the savory dishes didn live up to the expectations I had. The foie gras with espresso dulce de leche, raspberry puree, and puffed rice was too incoherent and too sweet for an appetizer. The gnocchi with mushrooms was good, but not of any exquisite flavor. My companionsfish dishes didn have enough seasoning. However the brussel sprouts were perfectly crispy and light, and the bread basket was somehow my favorite thing I had. The desserts were the meal saving grace. The apple pie dish was my favorite, with the maple sticky bun at a close second.TL;DR come here for wine and dessert after a game or your dinner at another restaurant., This place just doesnt do it for me.I like the look especially in the front room overlooking F street, huge windows allow you to people watch, the interior is sleek, nice bar area, I did not go into the main dining room as I was there for happy hour, but the bar area is spacious and has an open vibe to it.Drinks were decent, I had the Chinatown Shake, nicely mixed, faint taste of vodka went well with the accompanying ingredients. Service was fine, waitress was pleasant but not anything special.The food wasnt particularly good. I had the twice fried chicken and it wasnt very flavorful. They add some kind of spice to provide a kick but overall flavor was lacking, it just didnt taste like anything at all. It appears they went heavy on spice and light on any seasoning.All in all, just not a fan and I doubt I would return anytime soon., My review is based in one visit. I sat at the bar, had a NoPa Punch (delicious! although the alcohol was imperceptible) and a hangar steak (no complaints). Service was friendly enough, just lacking and they didnt appear overwhelmed. Nothing was horrible but, then again, nothing was good enough to prompt me to come here again., My friend and I hit Nopa before a concert at the Verizon Center. We made reservations via OpenTable and were seated right away. It was a busy Sunday night with many pre-concert goers. Interior was very nice. You walk up some stairs from the street to the restaurant. Bar on the left, dining all around. It was very loud, though...not a venue youl want for an intimate dinner for two or if you need to catch up with a friend without having to speak loudly across the table at them. We sat at a two-top, one bench seat and one chair. Very close...nearly elbows apart from our neighbors. A little awkward shimmying to the seat on the wall/bench side without having your a$$ graze the tables next to you or in someone face!NoPa has a three-course prix fix pre-theater/concert dinner for $35. We weren thrilled with the options on that one, though, so we went for the regular menu. We weren thrilled with the appetizer options this evening, so we instead started out with marinated olives...which were only eh in my opinion. Could have been more vinegary rather than the heavy oil they were in. There were maybe 5 signature cocktails on the flip side of the menu. My friend and I both had the Bombay to Vegas cocktail, which is a cilantro-infused tequila with jalapeno (with seeds and a cut round of jalapeno floating in the drink); I not sure if the owners of NoPa are the same as the owners of ps7, because I had the Dirty Mexican cocktail there and it was exactly the same...but very tasty nonetheless. My friend enjoyed hers, as did I (including my second serving of it!). We had two entrees: my friend had the roasted chicken with black eyed peas and hummus, which she said was very good (and she doesn typically order chicken in restaurants because it something you can make at home); I had the Chilean sea bass with Japanese eggplants with a wasabi drizzle over a sweet potato puree. The sea bass had a nice outer roasted crust to it, perfect temperature, and juicy meat that fell apart well as you ate it. It didn wow me per se, but it was well executed and flavorful nonetheless. The dessert we had was excellent, though. I forget the name of it on the menu, but it was like an Almond Joy chocolate bar...chocolate ice cream and wafers infused with chocolate coconut ice cream...something like that. It even had a little salt to the top wafer, which was perfect. We shared that dessert and there wasn a drop left on the plate when we were done with it. As for the service, we felt well-attended to, but the bussers were a little overzealous. Two or even three times they came by to buss our dishes while my friend was still eating hers. We were just deep in conversation and savoring our meals, and it felt a little awkward having to explain 2-3 times no, she still working on it. One tried to buss the bowl of olives while I was still in the middle of serving myself the last helping of them. Wait until we finish our meals, people! Each course came out very promptly, our waiter checked back to make sure everything was good, he asked if we wanted another cocktail, what type of water we wanted for the table, and was prompt with delivering/taking the check at the appropriate time (not rushed).All in all, a very good meal and a very good venue for a pre-concert or pre-theatre dinner. Reservations recommended for prompt seating., I held a work dinner here with about 20 lawyers--absolutely everyone enjoyed their food and I honestly couldnt believe how great our server was. Everything was on point and the whole dinner went off without a hitch. I loved it so much I brought my boyfriend there for brunch--aside from it being just as amazing as the dinner, the manager remembered me and chatted with us at our table for a while. Love this place. Great service and impeccable food. I would recommend it for any occasion, even a quick brunch!, 2 1/2 starsI went last Friday. This place didnt seem to be firing on all cylinders. The service was inconsistent. The bartender was helpful. The hosts were great, but then it took awhile for us to get a server. Thereafter we seemed to have different servers -- there was clearly confusion (and it wasnt that busy).The space is pretty nice.Our gnocchi app was excellent. But I had a hangar steak that had a nice crust/char and flavor, but was chewy and tough as hell (not cut against the grain, maybe)?This could definitely be a 4-star place if they worked out the kinks, but given the price and the number of acclaimed, high-dollar restaurants in DC I havent gotten to try, I dunno if Ill give it another shot. (Maybe post-work happy hour thing if they have food and drink specials?), I will have to write a better, longer review soon. I keep meaning to write a review because I had the BEST BRUNCH there! The staff was super friendly and accommodating, the food was delicious, the ambiance was delightful, they brought us a complimentary selection of desserts to share.... Amazing. The only thing I didnt love was the pastry selection we ordered. There were three smallish pastry items and they were just ok. Every thing else was phenomenal. I run a brunch Meetup group, so I go to a lot of brunches at a lot of different restaurants. NOPA is now one of my favorite places to go!, The bread basket and brussel sprouts are delicious! I didnt like the Roasted Almonds because they tasted like meat, Im a vegetarian. The cheese plate is small and had tasteless cheeses like ricotta. The tables by the bar for happy hour have such a nice view with the large windows, well if you can ignore the glaring Verizon Center Times Square like flashing billboard. They have a holiday drink menu with fun drinks like mulled Manischewitz and gingerbread martini. Check your glasses one person at my table at lipstick on his.I didnt like that they allow people to smoke at the top of their stairs. It was raining outside and I had to walk through a cloud of smoke with the people standing under the awning., I wasn impressed with my meal though my friends enjoyed theirs. I ordered a croque monsieur; it was made with nice thick but burnt/toasted brioche slices, lots of ham, and covered with bechamel sauce so it ended up kind of gloppy, accompanied by an ok salad that had a couple of rotten bits in it. Coffee was a full French press pot, nice and strong but served with milk instead of cream. When I asked about it the waitress found some half and half for me. Nice modern decor and tasty rolls., I wish I could give this place 10 stars for brunch. I organized a birthday brunch here for one of my best friends, and it was hands down the best brunch experience I have ever had. From the quality of the food, to the AMAZING service (I am looking at you, Maria)-- this place can not be beat!! Most of the table did the bottomless mimosa option with an appetizer and entree, and there wasnt one person who didnt LOVE their food. The complimentary breadbaskets were off the charts, I have paid upwards of 8 dollars for a brunch breadbasket that was not nearly as good- (think warm blueberry muffins and fresh rolls). The entrees were enormous portions with high quality ingredients, and our server knew her stuff and was able to make great recommendations. She also kept the mimosas flowing, which was greatly appreciated. So glad to have found my new favorite brunch spot!, There is a lot to love about nopa Kitchen+Bar, the brasserie now housed in the former Zola space just north of Pennsylvania Avenue (hence the name, nopa.) in the Penn Quarter area of DC. From the smiley greeters, to the cozy d39cor, to the simple yet exacting service, to the food itself ---the latter being the crowning glory of this place, of course. The restaurant is under the helm of Executive Chef Greg McCarty, who started his culinary experience under the watchful care of Chef Jean Georges Vongerichten. There is no doubt that his experience with Jean Georges, and other Manhattan-based restaurants, have become part of Chef McCarty style and penchant for creating amazing American dishes that are laced with French & Asian nuances. What comes together at nopa is nothing short of outstanding.Friends and I visited nopa for the first time recently this Restaurant Week, and unlike other RW menus, nopa was quite varied; there was definitely something for the different tastes within the group. With four of us dining, we did our best to try a different dish at each course. Standout appetizers were: roasted beet salad --which, if youe not 100% sold on beets (as I am), was a pleasant and flavorful surprise... the house-made garlic sausage --flavors were reminiscent of classic Asiany garlic meat dishes... and the country pate --which was slightly more of a terrine, but with modest flavors emphasized with the sweet and sour pop of pickled radishes. The quality of the main dishes went up a notch: the skate was nicely prepared with a hint of spice which seemed to become more accentuated with each bite... beef cheek stew --which offered a generous portion of tender meat over warm, creamy parmesan grits... the Chilean sea bass was perfectly cooked, and exuded a grace that only the perfect mix of wasabi and caramel can provide... and finally, the winner of all the dishes, the pork belly was the spitting image of perfection, and tasted even better. The soft and tender meat was flavorful, and the charred fat was even better --although at once you knew you were inhaling a gazillion calories that were worth each and every bite. A side of the crispy Brussels sprouts was the perfect accompaniment, and is easily one of the best-prepared sprouts dish in the city.Desserts to end the night: coconut pavlova provided a nice sense of sweet on what felt like the lighter side... the brioche bread pudding with buttered rum sauce felt light, though we all know it probably isn nearly so (delicious regardless)... and the clear winner -- the chocolate Napoleon --a velvety chocolate mousse served with a side of caramelized banana and praline hazelnuts -- the delicate crunch of the banana served as the perfect yin to the crunchy hazelnutsyang.One thing not to miss: at the beginning of the meal --don miss the warm, buttery pull apart buns. Amazing.We sat in the main dining room, which was flanked by floor to ceiling windows giving diners a view of the portrait gallery and the busy street traffic below. The feel of the place is definitely cozy, with earthy tones on the walls, subtle d39cor, and a bar area that is extremely inviting and social. The service was excellent; our server was brimming with information, and willing to talk us through some items and not shy at all to share his favorites.The restaurant is a great place for a nice social dinner, or even an intimate table for two by the windows facing the street. The comfort of the space probably welcomes the social atmosphere, which adds to the total experience. For city diners, it easy to make nopa a mainstay. And stay I hope it will.
48|obelisk-washington|There are only 36 seats in chef Peter Pastans townhouse restaurant (next to Pizza Paradiso in Dupont) -- so you cant just go walking in off the street, you need reservations. Get them. This is my FAVORITE restaurant in DC. The food is northern Italian and brilliantly turned out. Pastan changes the menu daily to reflect his whims and the best offerings from his suppliers The wine list is long but not too tough on the wallet and leans towards Italian wines. Wish I could award this place 7 stars -- its way out in front of the pack., This Italian restaurant in a Dupont townhouse serves a fixed-price menu that changes daily and focuses on the simplicity of each dishs ingredients. Five courses of deliciously simple yet inventive food is the reason to go though. Even the breads and pastas are made in-house, but one negative (for me) is that the choices are limited among the courses, making it challenging for vegetarians and picky eaters. Id recommend calling in advance for a sneak peak at the menu if you have this issue. One tip: save room for dessert - this is one of those restaurants where the dessert doesnt take a second seat. The atmosphere is elegant yet cheery and despite the close proximity of the tables around you, it manages to be intimate in a good way. Its not exactly library quiet though. Reservations are needed and you better make them WAY in advance (there are only 35 seats and they fill up quickly!)., this is a really great restaurant.so great that i thought i was sure to score on prom night after taking my date here. i ordered mushroom soup. it smelled like butt. the soup was good but i didnt get none.the food is still great. but stay away from the butt soup., As a result of a lucky football bet, I won dinner at Obelisk. And it did not disappoint. Like Komi, its another fixed price, expensive, converted brownstone restaurant in the heart of Dupont that has great ambience and great food., I love this little place. Ive been here twice -- the first time during my honeymoon. It is intimate, and romantic, but not in a cloying kind of way. The waitstaff is professional and low-key.The food was fabulous both times. There are occasional experiments that the chef tosses out that arent necessarily my favorites, but I really appreciate his adventurousness, and the knowledge that we wont be getting the same old same old. The ingredients are always so fresh, and high quality. I remember particularly an appetizer topped with the most exquisite parmesan I have ever tasted.Not cheap, but perfect for that special occasion., I have been here 4 or 5 times. Each time I leave thinking I had a wonderful meal, but there was just a little chemistry missing.You do get to try some interesting things, last visit we had pig ear salad as part of our antipasti -- I cant say I was a huge fan.....actually, I cant say I was really overwhelmed by any of the antipasti.Squash ravioli with a very mild blue cheese followed -- but the dish was dominated by orange zest -- and in my mind needed something like a simple sage butter sauce to make it complete -- but still very good.I had the lamb chops for my secondi -- highlight of the meal, very simple and perfectly cooked.Secondi was followed by a nice cheese course and dessert. It is worth a visit -- time seems to slow down and you get to enjoy 5 course over the course of 90-120 minutes and service is top-notch. Atmosphere is elegant but not stuffy....you can hear most conversations in the restaurant....so it is not exactly intimate -- or is it?It is more expensive than Babbo in NYC when all is said and done with food, wine and tip -- and it does not leave me with the same impression. That probably isnt fair, but many people do speak of Obelisk as one of those types of food experiences......it doesnt quite hit that level with me, but it is still one of the better restaurants in DC., This place is excellent. The antipasti are wonderful, as are the paste. The desserts were a little off, but this is generally very fine food and the prices arent too bad. Tops for Italian in the city, as far as I know.thegourmetpig.com, expensive, sometimes hard to get a table, but the food is exceptional. best italian food you will get in washington, I needed a special occasion restaurant. It was Mothers Day weekend, I hadnt visited my mom and stepfather in over a year, had spent every major holiday for the last several years with my ex-SOs family. I did extensive online research and also asked around to friends who knew the area. Obelisk came up a couple times so I made a reservation.When we arrived, I thought perhaps Id made the wrong choice. Obelisk is in a tiny townhouse off Dupont Circle. The decor is not fancy - it literally looked as if someone had one day decided to turn their living room into a restaurant and went out and bought some tables and chairs to fill the room. No music, so you could hear every conversation in the room. Im generally of the opinion that ambience does matter when it comes to a dining experience, so I was worried that the dinner would be disappointing.I didnt need to worry. My meal at Obelisk reigns in my memory as one of the best meals I have ever had. Possibly takes first place.The menu is fixed price with five courses. Each course offered three choices, and since there were three of us, we decided to order all differently so we got to try every single dish on that days menu. We also ordered a lovely red wine that was recommended by our waiter, I wish I could remember what it was.The meal started with an antipasti platter that included fried anchovies, carpaccio, prosciutto, among other things. All delicious, each piece perfectly flavored - even the prosciutto was perfect on the palate, not overly salty like most prosciuttos Ive had. Then came individual dishes with baby buffalo mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes, sprinkled with olive oil and kosher salt. WOW. I had never previously, and never since, had mozzarella that good. The texture was amazing and the salt balanced out the flavor perfectly. I could have eaten just that and would have been happy.The pastas were delicious - so good that my mom, who was on one of those low-carb diets, couldnt help but devour hers and parts of ours. The meat courses were excellent, especially the steak (our least favorite was the squab, just because it was a teeny bit of a hassle to eat - lots of bones, little meat - but it was still good). Desserts were perfect - nothing too rich or too sweet, just the perfect finish to balance out the marathon meal.Everything was perfect. A meal this good is not only appetite-satisfying, it is emotionally satisfying., This is a special restaurant. I have always had amazing service at Obelisk (thanks Kat!). The space is small and intimate (so make a reservation). The food is incredible (and plentiful -- 5 courses)! It is exciting to see how the menu changes over the seasons. Ive had a hard time discovering new restaurants near Dupont Circle, because I always want to come HERE!, AMAZING.Small, Italian restaurant on P street. Youll take thre hours to enjoy course after interesting curse for a fabulous evening. Kat always takes care of us.Best breadsticks on the planet...no seriously...The hand-written menu changes daily.Cool space thats a little old, a little new, very Italian, very urban hip cool without trying..., A lovely space and beautiful presentation. However, the dishes are conceptually weak and tend to lack flavor, creativity and ultimately any reason to return. I have tried this place several times due to the inflated zagat ratings (but see the user reviews), but cannot find much to like about it except the aesthetics. The prices are exhorbitant and the dishes mediocre (not to mention very, very small). Most dishes overemphasize oil and salt, and cheese is involved in most courses. Worst of all, the flavor profiles in each course tend to remain the same rather than build or play off of each other. When the predominant flavors are salt and oil, it is not a good thing., First things first: if I werent sick to the point where I couldnt smell or taste, Im 98.153% sure I would have given Obelisk five stars. Ill update this when I return with full sensory perception.Obelisk offers a five-course prix fixe for 65$. Hailing from Manhattan, this is an incredible steal, especially considering the freshness and quality. My favorite course (probably due to limited stomach space) was the first: soft, velvety goat cheese slightly reminiscent of good buffalo mozzarella, fried cous cous, tomato gelatin, crab cakes... It was pretty much a meal in itself. I also adored my next course: a creamy mushroom soup with so much flavor it punched through my congestion. I didnt eat much of my venison, cheese plate, or dessert, but my dining party ensured me everything was magnefique!Service was impeccably friendly and well-trained. I cant wait to come back and write a full-on review. This place has the potential to break into my top five meals... Ooohhh., I would have to say hands down the best meal that I have ever had in DC. There was so much food that I cant even remember everything that was served. We were so stuffed when we left that we actually decided to walk home to Columbia Heights. The staff was great and recommended a great bottle of wine that complimented the food perfectly. My 2 favorite dishes from the night had to be the second course (beet ravioli served with in a brown butter walnut sauce) and the main course which we split the suckling pig. They carved it table side and the skin was crisp but the meat was very moist. The only negative thing that I can think of from the night is that I felt like the courses were served too quickly. I felt rushed and had to quickly finish each course when they brought out the next because there was no room on the table for the extra dishes (we were seated at a small 2 person table). I cant wait to go back., If I could eat at Obelisk and Komi only for the rest of my life, I would be happy. This place puts the food over all else, and it shows., ABsolutely fantastic value for the quality of service, delicious meal and overall ambiance. For the price you pay here for a 5 course meal, you could barely get the entree at similar-caliber restaurants. If you havent gone here at least once, you should. Crab cakes melt in your mouth.....ymmmmms, This joint looks nothing like a restaurant from the outside and more like an unimaginative brownstone, but when you do actually do enter to partake in their prix fixe menu (among the 15 other people eating in here, since this place is pretty damn small), the culinary maven inside of you will definitely not be disappointed. Parking is a bitch though in this area so cab it if you can, and as previously mentioned, this place is tinier than a McMansions living room, so make your reservations way in advance., The three best meals in my life have been eaten at Obelisk. The dining room is intimate and the staff are very attentive to, but not pushy with, their customers. It feels like youre eating at your own home. The food is amazing and well worth the price (which is very reasonable given the quality)., Obelisk served me the best meal I have ever had in DC. The only complaint would be that my stomach wasnt big enough to hold all of it. For $65 pre-fixe I got sardines, then cockles (sp?) which were soooo good, then raviolis, sea bass, a cheese course and for desert fabulous grapefruit and lemon sorbets. The service was amazing, very attentive and friendly. There are only 11-12 tables in the place so you get alot of attention from your server (not in an overbearing annoying way). The menu looks like it changed very often (it is handwritten and photocopied) which is always a good thing. Also, it give me another reason to go back and see what other delicious foods are in store., After the raving reviews about this place, I thought I was going to have a food experience like none other. That did not happen. That being said, this was a very very solid meal. Highlights: first three courses. They had a fresh cheese drizzled in olive oil with a little salt and fresh pepper. Spectacular and a great way to show off a great cheese. Most of the dishes in the first course were great. The pasta course was delicious too, as the was cheese course.Lowlights: the last two courses. Perhaps it was a mistake on our part, but my dining companion and I opted for the steak for two. It was nothing special, and the sides, a tiny bit of broccolini and onion rings were unimpressive. I only include dessert in this list bcos by the time dessert came round, I was so full, I dont remember what dessert was like. I just ate it, but clearly, it was not enough to make an imprint.I would like to give Obelisk another chance, and maybe pick another entree to see if that made the difference. But overall, it was good, maybe sometimes great, but never completely out of this world. And it was too much food., I went here this fall. For the price and the hype, this place is woefully inadequate. If it was about half as expensive as it currently is and the raves werent as raving, I would have given it three stars, but as it is it only gets two.A menu that changes daily? That gets a thumbs up from me because it means the chef chooses his raw ingredients well, based upon what looks great and whats fresh/in season. Adequate cooking? Yes. The cheese course was the best part of the meal, well-chosen, well-thought out, and varied. The mixed antipasti were just ok. There were deep-fried beef and shrimp, but honestly, you can deep-fry a woodchip and it would be tasty. The headcheese (not cheese, really a savory jello with bits of meat from the head of whatever beast its from) was nice but nothing to write home about. They had sardines with lemon. The truth of it is Ive had better sardines during the summer at Sasso in Bethesda (fresh, grilled, with a tangy garlic pistachio dressing on top of housemade potato chips = foodgasmic). I had a piece of fish with mushrooms for the main course. Again, it was adequate. Very well-cooked, technically without anything that was bad, but you know when youve grilled a piece of chicken to absolute perfection with no marinade, rub, or sauce? Like its good, technically speaking, but nothing makes you lick your fingers and dive into the rest of the drumsticks, snarling and biting at anyone who gets in your way. The same can be said about this food. It is cooked well. Technically, its good. I guess its rave-worthy if you grew up on crustless Wonderbread and balogna and American cheese sandwiches with a scraping of mayonnaise every day for lunch (obviously, not on the days you had crustless Wonderbread and just Jif peanut butter sandwiches), but it tastes like nothing special. If you are looking for a very flavorful rich meal/good date place, Id go to Sasso. The tapas are a little simpler midwinter than they were this summer, but everything is still very delicious. Ingredients are conscientiously sourced (sustainably fished seafood and the like, according to their website). During later evenings, theyre a dance club, but early evenings are for dinner, and given a choice between Sasso and Obelisk, pick Sasso. The menu is not handwritten, but it is well-thought out, well-done, and youll experience the creativity of a gifted young chef you will likely be hearing more about in the future., They claim that the menu changes daily, but my menu seems to be remarkably similar to what a lot of others here had.Everything was very good and very well prepared. The antipasti course was the star, creative, mixed and tasty. Really no room for complaint. As the Washingtonian pointed out the level of originality dips from there and the next two courses drop off a bit in creativity but are still perfectly cooked, rich and flavorful. I had a delicious oxtail pasta with a terrific brown sauce and a tender flavorful squab. Nothing there that was overly challenging to the palate, but lots of well blended flavors. The cheese course was amazing featuring some terrific cheeses that complimented each other quite well. I had a dark chocolate moose for desert with a caramel brittle topping that was a truly delicious combination. Attentive service, quaint atmosphere and delicious food with a nice mix of creativity and traditional goodness., Would have given it a 5 except the only option is prix fixe. The food was quite good but too much of it. They did accomodate my request to change my pasta course to a salad which they created for me. Very well done. The antipasti course was very generous and the cheeses were all wonderful, Easily the finest cuisine in the city and is always a surprise since that days menu is posted by the chef anew each morning. Must have been about 4 or 5 courses albeit some smaller than others, but they just kept coming. My favorite place for special occasions. Great go to spot for a great meal, but not cheap. Wrap-up: Simply delicious but be prepared to spend., Im between a 4 and 5 for this place.I came here for a friends birthday party a couple years back, and we had a party of 10. Dark woods with a modernist edge, make for a slightly atypical italian venue. But the food was excellent. We made liberal use of their italian heavy wine list, happily imbibing many a bottle.Though I have few specific memories of the flavours these years later, I have fond memories of the night., I can see why everybody loves this place so much. The assortment of really interesting, slightly modern, slightly rustic, Italian food is really first-rate. Our main dishes were fine-- really very good, I guess-- but the real show stealers were the array of small nibbles, amuse bouche, and other small plates that came out at the start of the meal and the cocktail menu. (My fiancee got a rhubarb sour, I got a blood orange/ arancello/ camapari cocktail that was gloriously fruity and bitter). If only it were possible to stop in just for drinks and snacks, I would do so often., Obelisk is truly amazing. Went there for my husbands birthday, and we were both blown away by the food. The restaurant itself is rather small and we were seated in the back against the bar (some people may not have enjoyed the location, but trust me, that had its advantages.) What I loved most about it is that eating there is an experience. The parade of small dishes was really fun- Im a pretty picky eater, and even I found something to love about the suckling pig. Overall, everything that we ate was thoughtfully- and in many cases, artfully- prepared and we both walked away blissfully happy with our meals. My husbands only complaint (which for me was actually a bright spot) was the length of the meal- at Obelisk, they take their time and in a time where so many meals are rushed, so can you., This is a really tough one to rate. I love the *idea* of Obelisk. The waitresses were all incredibly nice, and the food was obviously fresh and high quality. But Ill echo one of the other reviews I read here: our food was well-cooked, but bland. Well, at least the bigger courses were. Ill get to the various nibbles in a bit.There were two larger courses--pasta and meat. My pasta was linguine and guanciale in a cream sauce. Sounds incredible, but it was just meh. Couldve used a grating of parmesan, some butter, *something.* For the next course, my wife had bass, and I had lamb with anchovy butter, and both were plated beautifully. But again, meh. The bass in particular was practically unseasoned. Even the bread didnt have enough salt.I will say the various other courses were pretty interesting. There was a mushroom bruschetta that was probably the best Ive ever had, and the suckling pig was delicious. We also had fried sweetbread which was pretty good, if a bit gruesome. Well, not as gruesome as the cheese course. I wont factor our opinion on that into the star rating, because my wife and I are obviously not fancy-cheese people. Sweet mother of mercy was that cheese vile.All-in-all, Ill go with three stars: four for the service and two for the food. Nothing was bad, exactly, except for that nasty cheese, but at $240 for two people they need to do better., So I finally got to Obelisk, and I was not disappointed. My gf father was in town and so this was the place he picked to go..not like he had to twist our arms.Lets start with the setting. It looks like a town house that without the sign, you think was a family home. The place it tiny, only about 30 seats, and has a very warm feeling to it. Ie never been to Italy, but this is what I picture a really small local place to look like.My gf is a vegetarian, so we alerted them and they prepared slightly different variations of the dishes for her. Very accommodating.The meal:Anti-pasti:First we were brought Burrata Cheese with olive oil. It was a mix of mozzarella and ricotta. Delicious, very fluffy and flavorful. Second was a sardine over onions with lemon sauce. The sardine was perfect over the onions.Following that was duck breast with onion jam. The duck was tender and cooked to a nice medium rare.After that was a sucking pig fritter. Probably the worst (not bad though) of the first little plates. Next was Crostini with fava bean spread and pecorino cheese. This was a nice way to finish the mini anti-pasti.First Course:I ordered the tagliatelle with morel mushrooms, ramps and a very very rich butter sauce. While it was super rich, it was still amazing. After this course I was definitely feeling a little full...but I was ready for more.Second Course: Sea Bass over peas, artichoke hearts, fava beans with a light lemon sauce (aka as a lemon on the side). The fish was tender and flaky and the skin was left on a just cooked through. My favorite dish of the night.The Cheese Course:Pipedreams goat cheese, a cow cheese and a mix. These were served with sour cherries.The dessert:I ordered the lemon tart, my gf ordered the chocolate cake with coffee creme anglaise. Her dad ordered the strawberry soup with black pepper ice cream. I really enjoyed the tart, while it was probably the least imaginative of the three. The soup was quite tasty and the chocolate cake was super sweet and a bit too much for me.Overall this place was fantastic. Each course were very delicatly plated and really showed a very classic style of Italian cooking...but of course with some special aspects.I will be back, no doubt., This is a real treat. Despite living and working nearby for two decades, Id never been to Obelisk. The longer I didnt go, the less I felt compelled to; I find it hard to get excited about 21 year old restaurants. I usually find them to be a little long In the tooth, coasting on past glories. Not to worry; despite its age, Obelisk had the excitement and freshness of something brand new. The lamb and duck dishes were outstanding; plenty of non-meat dishes to satisfy my wife.There wasnt a course that didnt work for me. Great atmosphere (unlike what I think I read on Sietsema, it wasnt at all loud). And the service, usually so mediocre in DC, was top notch. A new favorite., Ill have to base this review on my boyfriends reaction, as I am not really a foodie. In fact, I am probably the anti-foodie. Full disclosure here, I find McDonalds cheeseburgers to be a culinary pinnacle (mmm...mushy AND bland, what more could you want....)But I digress. We actually went to Obelisk about a year ago but since my boyfriend is still talking about it I thought it would be worth writing a review. It is a gem in his eyes so it seems worth it to point other people in the direction of this place. As for me, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience, but probably would have enjoyed something about a fourth of the cost just as much. Be forewarned, Obelisk is pricey and even after all this time it is still a process to get a weekend reservation there. My summary - if fab food is worth it to you, then by all means, save it for a splurge. If you are more my speed, well, Ill see you at Mickey Ds!, Big expense, big disappointment! As a special birthday dinner, I took my mother and aunt to Obelisk. For starters, the ambience of the restaurant left so much to be desired. Maybe I old-fashioned, but for $75 per person (without drinks!), I expected something a little more elegant. It is a simple room with very simple decor. No need to dress up; plenty of people in shorts and jeans! The manager gave us a terrible wine recommendation. My mother dislikes tannic wines, and I asked for something smooth and mellow. Instead we were given acidic and bitey. I even asked for a decanter, in hopes of salvaging the $56 bottle, but to no avail. Our waitress simply poured it into a glass pitcher!!! The antipasti course was nice; excellent selection of cheese, meatballs, cauliflower, panzanella...served in high quality olive oil. But the main course left us all cold. We only had three choices: a pork chop, duck breast, or tuna steak. We had the pork chop and duck breast....pork was average and the duck breast greasy. I only ate one piece of mine. The cheese course was delicious, but the desserts were hardly worth our time. I even asked in advance if they did anything special for birthdays and they said yes. Well, dessert was included in our meal and all they did was put a candle on my mother piece of very tart and over-done fruit pie. I have had many wonderful meals in DC and this was definitely one of the most average for a way above average price! With three dinners and a bottle of wine, our total was $311!!!! I have no problem paying for good food, but this was not it. If you want to pay this kind of money, take your business to Citronelle or 1789. Way better ambience, service and quality! We won be going back to Obelisk., When I decided to try Obelisk, I read the reviews, but I guess I hadn considered the price carefully enough. I sat down to eat with my brother and best friend, and our eyes bugged out when we saw the $75 fixed-price menu (The maitresse-di even asked Are you sure you all want to stay?). However, we had already sat down and committed ourselves, and hey, we deserve it! And so it began...Amazing antipasti...wrapped sardines, buffalo mozzarella, pork belly....delicious first courses: I had a shrimp soup. Fantastic main courses, with a variety of choice: two kinds of fish, a pasta dish, and the lamb....mind blowing cheese course served with pear jam....and the desserts....oh the desserts....I realize that these things are subjective, but I would recommend Obelisk to anyone whose pockets run deep. If you tried it once and hated it, go back when they have different menu items. The three of us aggreed, one of the best meals we have ever had., This is a going to be a long one, so if you dont want to read the whole thing, I will summarize nicely here. The fixed menu is $75. We spent about $50 each on drinks. Worth every penny. Food is delicious, staff is friendly, wine is great.So I tried to book a table earlier in the week for Saturday night. They only have eleven tables apparently, so they were booked. But they put me on the wait list. Called me on Friday, but I missed the call because I was in a meeting. They gave the table away again, but they called 24 hours later with another cancellation. I guess the lesson here is get on the waiting list. People cancel. I never go to northwest, so I didnt really judge the amount of time I needed to get there. Tip. If you go down P St, the next cross street is one way. Go past it, do right, right, right and theres a spot thats marked no parking. But its not. Its diplomatic parking M-F during the daytime. Its a good get. Yes, thats right. My reviews are that good. So because of my excellent parking skills and my terrible understanding of distance we showed up like 20 minutes before our reservation. The table wasnt ready yet, bar was full. Its a little restaurant. I might have been upset, but they sat us out on the stoop and we drank prosecco for 20 minutes. Better than that, we drank on the house. Felt a little weird drinking wine on the porch watching flocks of identically dressed people walk past, but I survived.So anyway, we got seated. We had like four waitresses. All very friendly. They brought out antipasti, which is, apparently, Italian for appetizers. Not a single person in that restaurant was speaking Italian. I know Tarzan learned to speak French from a phonograph record and read English from a Bible, but he was a fictional character. I dont know why people were writing in Italian and speaking in English. But they were. There were a bunch of different little appetizers. They started with some almonds which Im told were roasted in fennel and olive oil. They were crunchy, but I dont think thats particularly special. I mean, most nuts are crunchy. Then they brought out bread and mozzarella. Not together. There was bread, which was good, but bread is bread. The mozzarella was just a big piece of cheese on a plate with pepper and olive oil. It was pretty fantastic, very soft and cheesy. Sorry. I dont have a developed vocabulary for describing cheese. Trust me though, it was good and cheesy. Olive oil and pepper obviously gets soaked up by bread. Thats a pretty basic thing that happens with food. You probably didnt need me to explain to you that you should do that. But apparently there are people out there writing and speaking in different languages who may or may not have been raised by jungle gorillas. So, if thats you, and the language you read happens to be English, then you should know that in civilized society, people often dip bread in olive oil and pepper. Its a sight better than grubworms and bananas or whatever it is you grew up eating.After that they brought out some sort of mutant nubby cauliflower which was inexplicably green. I thought cauliflower was white. It was done up in roasted garlic and breadcrumbs. Seriously exceptional garlic flavor. There was zucchini egg pie that was served cold. Not what I expected. Actually the only thing that didnt impress me. I guess its kind of a gamble though. I mean, when someone brings you like ten things in a row to eat, odds are one of them wont be insanely delicious.There was shrimp next. But this was no ordinary shrimp. This was the platonic ideal of a shrimp. Fried, juicy, with fresh squeezed lemon and a lemon mayonnaise cocktail sauce that exploded with lemon fresh goodness in my mouth. Like a little crustacean oral orgasm. I recommend it. There were lamb meatballs, which were pretty damn delicious. Some sort of red sauce highlighting a great meatiness that was just fantastic. I know, I know. I ate some poor ewes child. Im sure if she was in any way sentient, shed hate me. But shes a sheep. Sheep is a basic euphemism for mindlessness, so Im not really worried about retaliation. I think there were some other ones. Maybe one more? Cant remember. I didnt write this down. If I had though, you can bet it would have been in English. The first course, I had a pasta dish. It was the long flat kind, with a ton of butter and huge heapings of fresh jumbo crap mixed in. My friend had quail and wild mushroom. The mushrooms were fantastic, all little and red. I wouldnt have eaten them if Id have found them in the forest. But if a complete stranger puts them on a plate and charges money for them, I just chow down. Its a miracle any of us survive long enough to die of cancer. But this restaurant gets a whole extra star for not killing me with poisonous mushrooms. Heres something new. Review length is limited to 5000 characters., The bottom line: One of the best restaurants Ive ever visited, anywhere. Consistently delicious, wonderful staff, simple but elegant decor. Although we have been to Obelisk before for special occasions (engagement dinner and birthdays), last Friday my wife and I returned to our beloved Obelisk. We had a late reservation, so we were hungry and excited as we settled into our seats in the sparsely decorated dining room. As we were seated, a member of the friendly, knowledgeable and unpretentious wait staff served some toasted, oiled and salted almonds. To start, we ordered glasses of Prosecco (crisp and refreshing) and settled in to make our menu choices. After we had chosen, along came the fabulously textured house-made bread. One bread was more moist and spongy and one a bit more airy. There were also two-foot tasty bread sticks.WINEDolcetto DAlba-A delicious light body red with dark cherry accents.ANTIPASTI MISTIBurrata-Soft, creamy and flown in frequently from Puglia, Obelisks burrata is served simply with extra-virgin olive oil, fleur de sel and freshly ground pepper.Salt Cod Fritatta-The slightly salty fish balanced well with the sweet egg in these 3/4 inch high cool wedges of eggy-salty goodness.Tomato Salad-Three large thick slices of red and yellow heirloom tomatoes (and a few halved cherry tomatoes). Topped with torn basil, olive oil, fleur de sel, pepper and a lovely aged balsamic (tis the perfect season to enjoy tomato goodness). Fried Sardines-A perfectly crispy tempura-like crust. Moist inside and complimented by a lemony green sauce.Porchetta-A slice of roast suckling pig. Crispy skin edged on the inside with tender meat. It was stuffed with a concoction of ground meat, offal, herbs and spices. PRIMIMe: Suckling pig agnlotti with spinach and sage-A plateful of lovely fresh made pillows of pasta stuffed with (what I assume to be) the aforementioned ground pig. Topped with sauteed spinach and a rich pork/sage broth. Wife: Arugula ravioli with walnut butter 5 (or 6) fluffy ravioli filled with fresh arugula and in a light but rich walnut butter sauce. SECONDIMe: Striped bass with chantrelles and pancetta-A perfectly cooked piece of bass on a large bed of the freshest chantrelles I have ever tasted. The crisp and salty pancetta brought out the rich forest-buttery chantrelle flavor to compliment the fish.Wife: Quail with chard, pine nuts and golden raisins-The quail was rubbed with vin santo which sweetened the skin and matched so well with the sweet raisins and slightly bitter chard. FORMAGGI w/ fig jamPecorino Stagionato-a triangle of rich, firm, flaky and pleasantly gritty sheeps milk cheese.Bonrus-A creamy soft cheese (sheep and cow blend). Not too much of a barnyard fragrance.Taleggio-Soft and creamy with a not unpleasantly strong smell.DOLCIWife and I: Chocolate cake with caramel sauce-Light and rich chocolate cake swimming in a mouthwatering sea of salted caramel (and some chocolate) sauce. SMALL SWEETSChocolate mint truffle-tasted of freshly picked mint (and rich chocolate, of course)Biscotti-Not too crisp biscotti tasted like they had been soaked in sambuca.Raspberry gele39-Tart, sweet and sad (because it was our last bite of the night).It was a fabulous meal, great service, and we will be back. Thank you Obelisk!, This would really be 3 1/2 stars if I could do that. Where to begin? I was excited about eating at Obelisk. I read a lot about it on Yelp and it sounded great. The food was terrific and the service was really good. I had no issues with the restaurant at all and would recommend it...But...Its expensive, and to be honest (Im not a cheapskate), but I felt like I could have gotten just as good for my money at the Tabard Inn or other places.So, if you go, youll get a good meal, but you may not think the amount you spent was worth the food you got., (Three and a half stars) Like everyone who has reviewed this restaurant on Yelp, I was excited for weeks to eat at Obelisk. I decided to take my lady friend (LF) there for her birthday as she had been talking about this place for years. The reservation process was a little awkward... when I called a few weeks in advance, they told me to call them back a few days before to confirm - ummm, shouldnt you be calling me back to confirm? I also let them know that it was my LFs b-day, now I know Im not going to Cheesecake Factory or Friendlys and expecting a free dessert but I wanted the wait staff to acknowledge it by wishing her a happy birthday or even write Happy B-day on her menu, something that a lot of places have done for me - I guess this was too big a request because they asked me what I expected them to do - rude. Now, getting past all that, I was still excited for the food. The place was tiny and intimate and the wait staff was extremely friendly, attentive and professional. But the food... well it fell just short of my expectations. The bread was bland, my octopus app smelled too fishy even for me and a lot of the dishes lacked flavor. The dishes that were on, were excellent - lobster mushrooms, lamb and a few others I cant remember. The wine list was also excellent. Overall, for a fancy tasting menu meal, the price was spot on and the food was good, not great. But, its not even the best Italian in the city (Tosca)., The only rival to Komi in D.C. The service was perfect, the got every detail but still felt casual and friendly. The food was delish - tasting menu only. The space was much smaller and casual than I expected, not a complaint, just surprised. The dining room is the small front room of a Dupont rowhouse. The space was bright and airy, and even cool on one of the hottest days of the summer., Obelisk is homey and inviting. The service is executed perfectly and every little dish proves the chefs magical culinary abilities. Nothing is a let down, and not once did I feel like it wasnt worth the price tag. Im completely in love with this restaurant. (for my full review lavienouveau.wordpress.c206), This is not a place Id come all the time for dinner. Couple of times a year is enough. The fixed price menu is very reasonable if you tkae into account the creativity and quality of the cuisine. The place is small, VERY unpretentious, and it truly delivers. Good wine list. And every time you go its a surprise. Definitively one of the best restaurants in DC., The starting courses were unreal. Each course was thoughtfully arranged with simple and fresh ingredients. I walk by this restaurant all the time and the menu is always changing according to seasonal variations of ingredients. After visiting twice, the only similarities between the menus were the long crispy bread sticks. At 75 dollars for the tasting menu, its about half the price of Komis degastazioni menu. I love fine dining in casual atmospheres and obelisk delivers., Let me say first, the service here was fantastic, I could not rave enough about it for you to understand until you go.Past that the food was great, but not worth a second trip back for me. I recommend going once, its a great date spot, but I think youll find its not worth a repeat trip with all the other top notch places to eat in the area., We went here for our one year wedding anniversary and had a nice time. The service was great every step of the way. However, the food was not as elegant or as well executed as we had anticipated. It was, in our opinion, a more rustic approach and some of the dishes were not really not that impressive. Two of the starting courses were a lamb skewer and panzanella, neither of which really did anything spectacular for us. The house made buratta was delicious however. In addition, we found the squab to be very rare, far beyond what we could eat (and were medium rare/rare steak eaters).Overall, I had very high expectations for this place and although the service was fantastic, the food was somewhat lacking. For my money, Id probably go to Komi., I come from NYC, where, I believe, we have the finest dining in the states and possibly the world, but I havent been everywhere to test the theory. Obelisk met all of my palate-driven desires. With only about 20 seats in total, the room is small and intimate, but not crowded or tight. The wine list is well-thought out, balanced and appropriate to the food. And the food was divine. Definitely of the finest meals Ive enjoyed in DC, and at a fraction of the cost of CityZen, my favorite of DC restaurants. The excellence is in the simplicity. Everything was understated, from the starting series of canapes, to the entrees and desserts, nothing felt over-wrought or contrived. The absolute perfection of 3 or 4 ingredients on a plate was all that arrived at our table for 2+ hours. I wont go into details, as none were overlooked. I look forward to my next visit to our capital and Obelisk., Everything was wonderful. This would be my number #1 restaurant in all of DC. I am a vegetarian and the customized my meal perfectly for me. The atmosphere is a little dated, but it is the best food, and experience, that Ive had in DC.The staff are amazing, the food spectacular, and I just loved the whole thing.The only downfall? I was full, uncomfortably stuffed almost halfway through. I couldnt enjoy the last few courses because I was so incredibly full., Okay, Ie never written a Yelp review before, but after going to this place, I felt like I need to start.Wow. Just wow. I wish I had something clever to write about it, but as soon as you stroll up and see that the menu is the only thing you can order for that night, you know it going to be good.Started with the antipasti, all of which was excellent: soft, creamy cheese flown in from Italy, tuna crudo, salt cod frittata, and something else great that I can remember.Next was pasta, I had the goat raviolli-type things which came in a broth and was more like a soup. This was the only part of the meal I didn think was otherworldly. I tasted my mother gnocchi in creamy cheese sauce with chives, which was possibly the best thing Ie ever eaten. Light and fluffy with some great textured beads of flavor just exploding in your mouth. Outstanding.Went with the roasted quail for my entree which was just a tad gamey (in a good way) and perfectly seasoned. I didn really like messing with all the little bones, but that was my own fault. Mom lamb chops were great.For dessert, had the hazelnut chocolate cake which was just the right amount of sweet.Top it all off with some closing sweets and a very solid bottle of wine for $40 and at $200 for 2 people before tip, an excellent bargain for arguably the best restaurant in the city. Highly recommend, and be ready for some surprises on the menu every time you go!, This is probably the first fancy restaurant Ie dined at in DC where I spent a lot of money, but left feeling like it was completely worth it. Komi was amazing, but when I left I was thinking.. was it $300 amazing? Let me start off by saying that this place is absolutely worth it, and they accomodate vegetarians very well. In place of the pasta course and an entree, they served me three pasta courses. Each course was delicious and we ended up with about 9 total since we had several appetizers. All their ingredients were top notch, and I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who was looking for a nice place on a special occassion, or who just wanted to splurge. Probably best gnocchi Ie ever had. The entire meal including dessert was absolutely delicious... though I gained four pounds the next morning., I should preface this by saying that I was starting to get sick. Its been an incredibly hectic month and a half (got married twice in two countries, had friends visit as soon as we returned home with 2 yr old twins, etc.) and all I really wanted to do was go home.I went to Obelisk the other evening with my office. Id been hearing for quite some time that this was one of the most, if not the most exciting restaurant in DC so I was really looking forward to it.My husband didnt think it was worth the price ($70 per person), but I reminded him that in sheer quantity it was a great deal of food.You start with antipasti, which consisted of several smallish dishes, then you chose a first course, a main course, followed by a cheese course, and a dessert course. $70 for all that seems perfectly reasonable in a higher end establishment.The quality of the food was excellent, as was the service, but I have to say it wasnt even close to one of the best meals of my life. In the States, the best meals of my life have all been in NYC, LA, SF, and even Chi-Town. This was good food, in a super friendly atmosphere, but it is still DC.Unless someone else paid I wouldnt go back, and even then I would try to convince them we should go somewhere else., Obelisk is quite possibly one of the best restaurants I have ever tried. And despite being one of the top (or perhaps the top) restaurants in DC, it is a homey, warm place where diners actually converse with each other instead of on their cell phones. Ive been three times, and every time, the food AND service was outstanding.All three times, our meal started out with fresh burrata, a soft and creamy mozzarella-like cheese. Id never had burrata before going to Obelisk, but its delicious and Ive been trying to find it since.I could spend the next few paragraphs describing what we ordered, but the great thing about Obelisk is that the pre-fixe menu changes all the time. Usually I hate when restaurants change their menus, but with Obelisk, its a treat. One item that seems to be constant is the chocolate hazelnut cake.My only warning about Obelisk: pace yourself. There is a cheese course. There is a post-dessert dessert plate. The first time I went, I could barely walk by the time we had finished. The menu may sound pricey, but for the amount and quality of the food you get, its not. I cannot think of a DC restaurant that is more deserving of all five stars., This really is as good as it gets. This might be my favorite place in DC (and Ive been to Komi and MiniBar)... great at home atmosphere, the burrata is AMAZING, service is helpful. Just fabulous!, I had never heard of Obelisk until I got a gift certificate for two for my birthday. I typically dont treat myself to places like this so this was a true treat. This is hands down one of the best places Ive eaten at. The service was great and the food was just perfect for me. My gf is not as adventurous, but what she was willing to eat she loved. Shes very anti-seafood but once she sampled one of the mini crabcakes she became a believer. Unfortunately, we havent come across any crabcakes as good as theirs. Very small intimate, cozy restaurant that deserves all the praise their getting., A very small but intimate and quiet Italian place that you could easily miss.Wonderful service, with an attentive staff, and comforting surroundings. Distinct touches such as the inner table that contains the cheese and cutting utensils the staff uses, giving the place an almost warm invite to someones home.Fantastic ingredients, fresh, home made pasta, awesome gnocci to die for. Excellent wine list as well, and also a good price for what you get which is exquisite. Probably the best Italian meal Ive had in the city. Perfect coursed Italian meal the way it should be., Well you already know Im in love with Obelisk. I just thought I would let you know (cough *brag* cough) that I had another fabulous meal here on Saturday. My friend Erin managed to resist taking photographs of every course this time, but it took a lot of restraint. Before Saturday, I thought that if you were vegetarian, you were just out of luck at Obelisk. Not so! My friend Erin called ahead for her boyfriend, and she was told not to worry about a thing. You know how the menus are handwritten here every night? Well the vegetarian menu is so special that it isnt even written down. For the meat eaters out there, for entrees, we got the suckling pig for two (succulent) and the duck (delicious). Our vegetarian dining friend got a chitarra (ridiculous pasta) with mushrooms dish. Usually the chitarra is in the secondi section for the meat eaters. If you see it there, order it. For dessert, we got the panna cotta. It looked like (and moved like) a boob on the plate. I spent a good minute just jiggling the plate and laughing. I just love the sense of humor these chefs have. And I may have had half a bottle of prosecco, too...., Amazing service and great atmosphere. The one thing to note is that this is for real foodies. Come prepared to have a meal worth working out for (or adding a few lbs. to the mid-section).I join the chorus of amazing reviews for this one., This place has everything you could ask for in a restaurant. Its intimate, serves great food and features great service. I love coming here everytime I get a chance., The best meal Ie ever had, hands down. This tiny little restaurant is a foodie delight with a warm, inviting, unpretentious ambiance. The menu changes every night, and the only decision you need to make is what to order to drink. We simply told our waitress no beef and the chorus of delights began. Our meal began with a fresh burrata, an almost liquid like gooey mozzarella-ish cheese that I dream about sometimes. It was a salty, creamy sensation with an ice cream like texture.From fresh made pastas to chopped cucumber salad seasoned with chive blossoms, course after course delighted and amazed us one by one. By the end of the dinner I was so overwhelmed with satisfaction I was professing my undying love for the establishment to our server.Don think about it for another moment, if you have not yet been, drop everything and call them up to make a reservation. You will have little chance of getting a table by just walking up, there are probably no more than 10 tables in the entire place and it always packed!, 5 stars for DC despite the decor. Obelisk is located right off of Dupont Circle and it is quite easy to miss, but that somehow adds to the charm. We were staying at the new Klimpton hotel (which is fab by the way) and started arguing that we should have left earlier only to find that we had passed Obelisk twice already. The unassuming location on the second floor of townhouse belies the incredible food in store. The atmosphere is somewhat casual. You hang up your own coats by the door. The space itself is quite small and there are very few tables but alot of attention. Customers ran from groups of hip 20-somethings in black to families in jeans to older couples in suits. The decor is somewhat dated, especially for the price you pay. While Obelisk does what it can with a nice table in the middle, floweres, etc, they seriously need some new flooring and tables (its a little upscale diner-esque).But, on for the meal. The staff was really friendly and were quite apt at describing all of the dishes and recommending wines. Obelisk also seems to cater to customer needs as I noted the vegetarian selections at the table next to us. The antipasti was great with good cheeses, fried squash balls, etc. Arugula pasta was really fresh and quite light. For the main meal, the fish was cooked quite nicely, but I was slightly confused as to how I was supposed to eat the artichoke presentation before me. For dessert, the grape sorbet is incredible and normally I dont rave about sorbet. But seriously this sorbet was concord grape goodness iced into delightful scoops. Obelisk has great fresh food, and maybe I am a glutton, but I left full, not uncomfortable. I highly recommend it for groups of 4 or less., This is one of the best restaurant experiences that I have had. Value is great, food is outstanding - innovative! As good as being in Italy (we had just returned the week before from Roma). Wine needs some work for lower priced wines. But this is my only criticism! (Except that the outside is not properly marked, so it is very hard to find.) Fresh ingredients, wondeful cooking - why cant all restaurants be like this!? Fixed price menu with great choices. Cant recommend it enough - this view shared by my wife and our two friends who were with us., When looking for Obelisk, make sure to look for...the obelisk. Thats the only thing that denotes the place as being a restaurant and not another house. The decore is not trendy, but rather feels like someones dining room: rattan chairs, patterned table cloths and benches. Suits are not out of place here, but blazers are enough.The great thing about the restaurant is its appetizers. They just keep coming and coming: pickled trout belly was one of the things I remember most, but the cheese pictured in the photographs is also great. If youre hungry, this is a great course to calm the hunger so you can enjoy the rest of your meal.One of the things this restaurant appears to be known for is its pasta. I had spinach-filled ravioli that was amazing. Then followed that up with a perfectly-cooked steak. Id like to give that rave reviews as well, but Im afraid I couldnt really taste the difference too much when compmared to regular steaks Ive had. That said, the insides of the steak were a deep reddish plum color and not sinewy in the least. This was a smooth piece of meat for sure. But I have to say that fillet mignon is the thing you really want to have when wanting to savor beef. Its bougie, but hey, thats how it goes. In closing: great romantic meal that will take about 2 hours to complete. Lots of little things make this a cut above the rest, and worth the price tag., This was one of the top three meals I have in DC in the last 10 years. I took a close friend here for his 30th birthday and the food and atmosphere made the night very memorable. The restaurant is cozy and small, with only a few tables. The dim lighting and candles ensure that you wont be distracted by other patrons, the staff or the ambiance. Obelisk makes it easy to enjoy great conversation and immerse your taste buds in whatever the chef has dreamed up that day. Youll think you have the restaurant all to yourself! The food is gourmet. The cinnamon/nutmeg meatballs was hands down the single best appetizer I have ever had anywhere in DC. I highly recommend this restaurant for a special date or an important occassion like a birthday, annversary, enagagement celebration, etc...
49|ocean-prime-washington|Dined at this restaurant, in the former Ceiba location near Metro Center station, several times prior to its grand opening (which isnt until Oct 6, 2016), sampling much of the menu and providing feedback to the restaurant itself. I usually dont take the time to write reviews but dont mind doing so when its a new establishment and its deserving of attention.In general, the food at Ocean Prime is high quality, carefully prepared and artfully presented, but I think even more compelling for a visit is the ambiance and service. Prior to the grand opening, the company sent service managers from its other locations around the country to work at this new DC location for a couple weeks. That tells you something about how serious the management team is in delivering a top-notch dining experience.Ocean Prime excels at appetizers such as its steak tartare, goat cheese ravioli, and prime roll. Its cocktails, such as the Berries & Bubbles with dry ice and Crimson Rye, are inventive and represent true craftsmanship in mixology. The seafood, such as oysters, chilled lobster, king crab legs, grouper, and blackened snapper (yes, I had all of those there), is as fresh and well-prepared as nearby Old Ebbitts. And its rare NY or Kansas City strip steaks, prepared Oscar or with blue chese crust, rival aged cuts in nearby Mastros or Del Friscos. Accompanied with roasted brussel sprouts, chophouse corn, or black truffle mac and cheese, you wont have room for dessert, though youll want to make room for the creme brulee, blueberry lemon cheesecake, or 10-layer carrot cake.The restaurant is still working on perfecting its menu, so a few areas for improvement, some of which Ive already shared with the restaurant and which Im sure theyll address:- Sushi appetizers could use more fish and less rice and vegetables. Rolls larger in diameter might also be nice. So while the prime roll is excellent, the tuna roll, lobster roll, and hamachi crudo could all use a makeover.- The crab cake appetizer was solid but not a standout; more seasoning, a thicker cake with larger lumps, and seared crispness would really help.- Oysters might benefit from being accompanied with a mignonette sauce instead of just the horseradish cocktail sauce. - More attention needs to be paid to ensuring steaks are not overcooked beyond their requested temperature.- While the seafood is excellent, its going to be difficult to compete with similarly fresh seafood at nearby Old Ebbitts, which is 50% off for their evening and late night happy hours. - The Jalapeno Au Gratin could use more jalapeno, the asparagus side dish could use the larger asparagus instead of the smaller version, and the black truffle mac and cheese could be infused with more truffle flavor, perhaps in using more truffle salt or truffle oil. Overall, go here for a treat to yourself while relaxing with friends or colleagues in a sophisticated ambiance. The attentive service makes it appropriate for a special occasion, whether professional or romantic, and they seem like would get to know regulars on a first name basis. This will certainly be the place to go for high-end, reasonably-priced cocktails ($10) and small plates ($10) during happy hour. Worth a visit., Was fortunate enough to attend a pre-opening night. The place looks great, with a good balance between dark steakhouse privacy and modern hotspot hip. They had a live band this night, which was great. I hope they have live music on regular weekends too.Our group tried a bunch of different dishes, all of which were delicious. I actually think the appetizers were the best, with the French onion soup leading the pack. It was so freaking great that I had the waitress find a Tupperware so I could take the leftovers home. Steaks were cooked as requested.Overall, the desserts were the least impressive, with the creme br3bl39e at the bottom of the ladder. It just didn taste like much. I will definitely be back, if for no other reason, the French onion soup is calling my name., There are undoubtedly some very good steak and seafood restaurants in Washington, DC, especially in the Penn Quarter area. And here comes Ocean Prime. Starting next week, DC A-listers, assorted famous and infamous guests and the executive set, will vow for a table in this see-and-be-seen restaurant. I wish I could say the honey-toned, warm finishes and gold matte accents wowed me, but I hardly noticed. The ambiance was modern but subtle, except for the urban-sleek tunes heard throughout. I had to make sure I mentioned to someone how much I enjoyed their playlist while our eyes absorbed the well-lit area.The hostess was welcoming and our waiter, Andrew, was thorough and attentive. He recommended their signature bubbles and berries and as the cocktail was shaken and served over dry ice, I quickly grabbed my phone because the presentation of this smoking witches cauldron was social media-worthy. Definitely a must order. Andrew raved about the freshness of everything on the menu - the cooked to order steaks are well prepared and the seafood is flown in daily from all over the country - so we decided to start with the surf-and-turf and shrimp saut39. The succulent scallops topped with melt in your mouth braised short rib had just the right amount of gravy. The shrimp sat in a bed of garlic butter with a couple of sticks of cheese filled phyllo pastry. Two bites of the dough and I had to push it away for fear of not having room for my entree. Amazingly delicious!I tasted a couple of bites of my friends Oscar-style 16oz ribeye, which was well marbled with a slight char, topped with lump crab meat in a house-made B39arnaise sauce. If red meat isnt your thing, there are plenty of other salads, poultry and seafood options that will please you, too. That ribeye is a steak-lovers dream, but I ordered my go-to Chilean sea bass. I spotted a truffle in the my mashed potatoes and albeit very flavorful, I wish there was more. We rounded out our entrees with roasted brussels sprouts.If you make it to dessert (and I recommend that you do), consider the luscious ten layer carrot cake. Youll also need a double expresso to stay awake after your meal. Since it was my first time here, I found my way to the back of the restaurant to the restroom. I dont usually write about such a thing, but it was so classy and spotless I had to add a plug. This wasnt a kissing date for me, but I can see how the mouthwash could come in handy. Ill surely be back., One of my best meals in memory! We went to the pre-opening where they are still technically in training mode, but youd hardly have known it except perhaps for the preponderance of managers everywhere. If they had service kinks to work out, I didnt see them!We started at the bar, where our bartender was friendly and efficient. She made a great Old Fashioned and Cosmo. The drinks were not cheap, but they were well made, right down to the chilled martini glass for my Cosmo. The live music for the pre-opening was a nice touch in the bar area.On to dinner at a nice table in a side section of the restaurant, that allowed for a bit quieter atmosphere. Knowing we planned to dine on some big steaks, we thought we would just start with a Caesar salad, but our waiter steered toward some more interesting starters. Were really glad he did. I had the Sonoma Goat Cheese Ravioli and was in heaven! A delicate, delicious sauce. My husband had the Tuna tartar and loved it as well. Im not big on seafood, but I did taste his Ahi tuna over Avacado and sesame ginger. It was excellent.We split a Caesar salad as well. It was a little different than your average Caesar, and I really liked the twist. I thought it was delicious. Maybe it was the garlic in the dressing? Hard to put my finger on it. Then came the filets. Mine with bearnaise, his was blue cheese crusted. Both were amazing! The bearnaise was thick and freshly made, with a delicious flavor. The steaks hardly needed any help, but the accompaniment was welcome. For sides we tried the creamed spinach and Jalopeno au gratin potatoes. As with everything we tried, the sides had their own twist on some very traditional things, and tasted all the better for it. Somehow, the spinach in the creamed spinach still had a bit of crunch to it, making it all the more satisfying and delicious. The Jalapeno flavor of the potatoes was not at all overwhelming. Just a bit of a kick to make them interesting and all the more tasty!Sure, we were full by this time, but with so many good things passing before us, we had to sample dessert! We went for the chocolate cake and were not disappointed! Just delicious! Creamy, not overly sweet, and obviously fresh.I cant think of anything to fault them on. The wait staff were all amazing, the food was divine. I liked the decor of the dining rooms, especially the coral in the window between the rooms. This is one of the best meals I have ever enjoyed. I hope they can keep up the food and service quality levels. But given that this group has successful restaurants all over the country, I think that is an easy bet., Came half an hour before opening by chance, they not only let me in with a yay wee launching meeting going on, they let me order a mimosa and treated me like my silly hungover hair of the dog needing behind was a very valued customer. Please, life, don ruin or jade any of the people working here, because as of now everyone is young and vibrant and happy and genuinely excited as am I. Steak may happen soon, but for now mimosa with fresh squeezed orange juice with the coolest eclectic music in the background along with flawless internet has my heart. This is going to be THE spot. Well done yall., Here on opening night. Ive been to most of the nice steakhouses in DC, and this one is at or near the top of the list. Live music, impeccable service, and delicious food make this is a pretty great experience. I had an 8 oz filet au poivre. For sides, Id recommend the jalape31o au grautin. If youre looking for a new spot for date night or just want a great steak - try this place!, Nothing but great things to report from public grand opening night. (I am not a food blogger, VIP, or anyone important enough to be invited to a soft opening or VIPunveiling so I think I get credibility points here lol) I was greeted promptly and excitedly by the front door staff. Courtney and Alicia- so sweet. They enveloped my best friend and I with a warm welcome and great hospitality. The ambience is appropriate for a steakhouse in the dining room, and appropriate for a steakhouse bar by the bar. They had live music, which I hope they continue on a regular and weekly basis. (It did not go unnoticed). Andrew, Fernando, and Felix serviced our table throughout the evening. Andrew, our primary server, was fantastic with his recommendations and advice. But they worked seamlessly through the dinner. Not intrusive, but never too distant. And always responsive! I was not expecting impeccable service, as we all know new restaurants have kinks... but there was no flaw to be sensed here. To drink- bubbles and berries, and a wine paired for our dinner dishes specifically. To eat - crab cake, snapper, filet mignon with blue cheese crust, asparagus with hollandaise, and jalape31o au gratin. Sides are made to share. My friends also dined on grand opening night and LOVED their dynamite sushi roll. Dessert- Baked Alaska... no Fire in the presentation, but woooooah was it amazing. Please- honestly, truly (I am not Joanne the Scammer and would never mislead you).... you must try., I use to frequent this restaurant while living in Dallas, Texas and now it finally in DC! What took them so long?!? LOLIt the same concept as Mastros with seafood, steak, sushi and a Soulful Singer (minus the piano) in the bar area. The only exception is the food is half the price of Mastros! Did you hear me??? Yes, half the price when compared to Mastros. No, $20 dollar Cocktails and there even a happy hour menu before 6:30pm. Even the bar area is larger, so youe not forced to dine in. My dishes of choice is the SeaBass and Crab Cakes plated on a bed of corn and drink of choice is the cucumber cocktail with Gin. It pretty strong *Hint, Hint*My waiter was exceptional and the Manager walked over to everyone table to ensure service was great., If there is one thing that sets OP apart from every other fine dining steak and seafood place in DC. It is clearly the service. The mantra,The answer is Yes...now ask me the question! Is one they not only talk about but one they TRULY embody. This place is amazing, the prime roll was fantastic, lobster bisque was rich and velvety, the steak cooked to a perfect mid rare and topped with succulent shrimp scampi (Chad, thanks for recommending I have it prepared that way), the loaded baked potatoes was was heavenly with it fluffy interior accompanying the saut39ed spinach to make the perfect accoutrements for my entree. When I asked, was it possible to combine a pumpkin ice cream with the decadent chocolate cake (which was not on the menu) the answer was not a problem. If you have had a great steak in DC and I sure you have; I can almost guarantee you have never had a dining experience like this one! OP is my new favorite DC fine dining spot., The service is impecable. Denise was an amazing server and made some great recommendations. Lets start with the French onion soup. Very mediocre. Ive had better elsewhere. It lack that flavor that is expected from a hearty beef broth. My companion had the tuna for her entree, and she enjoyed it thoroughly. I had the scallops. They were room temp to COLD. Very disappointing. The food alone I would give *, but the service gets a ****. I really would have appreciated the managers to give me eye contact and to ask me how my service and food was. I think that asked every other table except ours. Wheres the cheesesteak egg rolls like in Philly?Dress code? Are you kidding me? They asked me to remove my hat. Did they ever think that it could have been a disability? But yet you let a woman with all fishnet on in (I literally saw everything on her)! I might be willing to give it another try, but after spending close to $200, it was not worth it., Such a great spot ! They have delicious food . We got sushi and the truffle fries to start with ,the sea bass for entree and it was wonderful . The staff are very friendly and they have great cocktails on the menu ! I recommend the berries and bubbles ! Such a fun drink !
50|off-the-record-washington|This bar/restaurant in the basement at the Hay Adams is fantastic. With its fitting name and simple although elegant menu OTR is a great spot to go for an upscale lunch. While you can get something a bit more fancy, Im a huge fan of their burger. Its delicious and the fries that come with it are to die for. They serve beers in those tall glasses which I have always liked and they have a great selection., Off the Record is an upscale establishment that I have only been to with coworkers and business acquaintances, but never with friends. Located in the lower level of the Hay Adams hotel, Off the Record has a dim relaxing atmosphere. The prices are indicative of the clientele, which include non-elected government officials, journalists, and the private sector/K St. crowd. I have never seen this place busy, but the service has always been top notch. One nice thing is that if you stay a while the management tends to buy your party a round or serve complimentary appetizers. Actually hor derves would be a more appropriate word, since it tends to be bacon wrapped shrimp, not chicken fingers.Overall, Off the Record has an old-Washinton feel to it. Warning: This place is not frequented by the young, hip and modern crowd but rather more serious and distinguished Washingtonians. (Note: The Hay Adams is a famous Washington hotel located at corner of 16th and H St., near the White House. Press interviews are conducted on its roof with the White House in the background. Also, this hotel was featured in National Lampoons Senior Trip movie!), I honestly dont know why I dont come here more often. Its nice being around a crowd wearing ties after work when Im still wearing mine. Who wants to show off their corporate leash around all those free willed college kids? Its quiet, laid back and they serve good drinks and food. Damn, Im skiing all next week or else I would go posthaste!Certainly more adult and upscale than all the dupont places to the north of my office., I have nothing but love for Off The Record, my favorite bar in my favorite city. I love everything about it, from the fact it tucked in the basement of the Hay Adams to their tendency to pour a full wine glass as one serving of port to playing a game of guess the political figure with the dozens of caricatures adorning the walls. The first time we came here was purely by accident -- we missed our flight out of Dulles and every hotel room in the Washington area was sold out except for at the Hay Adams. Of course. Nothing cures the missed flight blues like a few cocktails so we headed down to the bar and somehow I became hooked for life. Perhaps they sprinkled some crack on the salty snack mix. Although this bar likely will not rank very highly on anyone elses list of places to go for fun, my emotional ties to this place have reached unhealthy levels and I will choose to go here over anywhere else. I get giddy just thinking about the night time walk I take by the White House to get to the bar. To me there is still something very exciting about not knowing who youe going to see or whose off the record conversation youe going to be privy to. I will never forget the time I ran into Henry Kissinger outside -- thankfully my brain was moving a little slow due to a decent level of intoxication, or I may not have resisted the urge to pound him into the ground with my female fists of fury., The Man and I had just left dinner and decided to continue the night with drinks. My first choice was Hay Adams. Tucked away, a hidden gem. We get there, order drinks only to be told by the bartender that the ABC inspector had just made them close shop!!! WHAT THA? No problem, we like the atmosphere so we decided on water and a Shirley Temple :) We got ready to pay the tab, but it was on the house.Well, I wanted to go back again the next night. Alrighty, the bar is open and in full swing. We order our drinks, chitchat with the bartenders/servers - just have a great time. Ready to pay the check It on the house, to make up for yesterday Youe got to love service like that.Wel always return to Off the Record., Off the Record is, just like the rest of the Hay Adams Hotel upstairs, perfect. Service is friendly and very attentive. Theyll happily accomodate special requests. The atmosphere is clubby - what you would expect from a bar across the street from the White House. Its lively enough that theres some conversation going on, but the volume level is just perfect for holding your own conversation. This is a bar for grown-ups who are more interested in a nice drink and conversation than pounding bass and a people watching scene. The menu is fine and the quality of the cuisine very good. Highly recommended., I agree with Nick - its a place to go in business attire. Its dark wood, old-school elegance, and 40s or 50s client38le. Its in the basement of the Hay-Adams Hotel, at the corner of 16th and H.I visited on 8/12/08 and enjoyed the experience. On a Tuesday after work in August, there were plenty of candle-lit nooks to sit. We werent rushed. The drink menu had some sophisticated cocktails - they should be, for $15 apiece. I got a martini that contained Limoncello; it was delicious. My friend got the Belvedere martini with goat-cheese-stuffed olives and said that it was delicious. Our server also brought over a trio tray of complimentary wasabi peas and nuts. I love wasabi peas. This is *not* a cheap, casual dive. Or even a sports bar. Its masculine, elegant, hushed, expensive and calming.I recommend., Five stars for what it is... which is an upscale, classy bar, with top notch service. The bar was not crowded, yet service was prompt and polite. You wont find many young and hip patrons, but you will be surrounded by established Washingtonians in business attire.My martini (The Presidential), was superb, but expensive at $15. I will say though the price is fair given the atmosphere, location, and quality; unlike the $18 I just paid in NYC for a martini not half as good (or as big)., Unless youre at the bar, the service at this place sucks, which isnt entirely shocking for a hotel bar. But that flaw aside, people still flock here because its SO COOL! And I cant blame them. This place is legendary. Smack-dab across from the White House, you dont get a much better location than this. The interior of this place rocks - cardinal red walls adorned with pencil-drawn caricatures of the most famous people in DC past and present give you something to look at and stay amused by. There is a bartender here who has been serving up cocktails to the whos who of DC for like 30 years, and I think his name is Dave. Hes a nice guy, but you can tell hes been there a while - moves a bit slower than your average bartender. Doesnt matter though, something about being served by a guy whos probably poured beverages for presidents and other bigwigs is cool. Havent eaten here, but the beverages aint cheap and neither is the food menu. Id say this is a good place to go for a few beverages and some wasabi peas and cashews or bar nuts and then move on. If you stay too long, the next thing you know youll be $100 poorer....All in all, definitely a great place to go for a beverage and some conversation. And on a good day, youre likely to see at least some sort of famous DC bureaucrat - its just another day at Off the Record!, This place feels very underground DC--mainly, I imagine, because it is underground ... in DC. But what I enjoy about this place is its close proximity to the office, minimal tourists, its never too packed and you can always snag a spot to kick back and enjoy some conservation with a coworker or friend. The caricatures on the walls of various DC cr38me de la cr38me are entertaining to check out. But agreed, it is a tad pricey so it isnt a place youd set up shop for the evening. All in all, its a great joint for grabbing a drink or two if youre okay paying about $10/cocktail or glass of wine.Appetizers are a go. And if complimentary wasabi peas, smoked almonds and mixed nuts are your kinda thing, you can snack your little heart out., I am a sucker for classic hotel bars, and this place is one of them.Located in the basement of the hotel, it seemed to me that this was one of those local bars where residents, people that work int he immediate area and hotel guests can all mingle int he same place.I did not think the place was over the top like a lot of people that posted reviews here. It was nice, with plush high end chairs and wall covering set in a burgundy/rose color. Had a San Francisco feel to it!The bartender was attentive and made good drinks. The food was decent and quick.This place has a reputation behind it as serving quality drinks and one of the bartenders is pretty popular but not sure if he is still there? Some guy named Bosley? The food is priced about right for a hotel bar and so are the drinks.There are a couple of TVs above the bar which is usually channeled on sports.This place is cozy and yet casual. No need to get all dressed up, but if that is your thing, you will not feel out of place. It does not have that New York attitude thank goodness. Jeans and t-shirt are fine., Thanks, Yelpers, this was just the kind of place we were looking for. Smallish hotel bar. Dark. Lots of people talking shop at 8-ish on a weeknight. We had a mixed appetizer plate, which was pretty good. Drinks were fine, nothing special. This looks like the sort of place that would make an awe-inspiring martini, but it was basic/average. Agree with the other yelper who said that service at the tables was spotty. When we werent ready to order right away, the waiter disappeared forever. Still, if youre looking for a watering hole that isnt a bar/club jammed with noisy people and loud music, this is the place. Next time were in DC, we will go back., I think this place is one of those hidden gems in dc. The funny thing is that the bar is practically HIDDEN inside the hotel.. Im glad i asked where it was cause I dont think I would have found it very easy otherwise.After opening a few doors, making a couple turns and going down some stairs I walked into a very elegant plush looking bar. The atmosphere is very inviting and sophisticated. For as fancy as it looks in here, many people are still dressed pretty casual though. Youll fit in dressed a multitude of ways.The drinks here are supposed to be astounding and have won best bartender awards. (Its not a dive though so they they arent cheap). I was here around 10pm on a saturday night and it was relatively empty so I wouldnt recommend coming here to meet people. This is a great place to come here with people as you can get yourself a table and have great conversation.While I was here all I had was a coke. I was still impressed though, the waiter came out and opened one of those vintage looking glass coke bottles and poured it into a glass for me. Others got various drinks and a specialty drink and seemed happy with it.Come here if you want to have some good semi-private conversation or just want a place for some good alone time., You gotta try it yourself. Classic. $15 dollar drinks but you are also paying for the whole vibe. Just a cool place to start the night or end the work day when you want to experience the finer things. The crowd and staff are always cool not pretentious. Lots of expensive suits in the house but all are welcome. Disregard the photo from the roof of the White House. This bar is in the basement., Thanks to yelp I knew what to expect when going in (namely very expensive drinks).I was there on a saturday night and the ambiance was perfect. The hotel is an amazing dc landmark (try to get onto the roof for picturesque views of the white house) and the bar is perfect for conversing.The service was some of the best. I wanted to try their scotch, but because I neither an old man nor an alcoholic, I did not know which to get. Our waiter let me try a few and described the subtle differences. The best part: the one he recommended was also their cheapest! (Still $12, though)If you like scotch, go for the 12 year aged one they have on the menu. The pomegranate sidecar is flat-out amazing. (If you are a man, be sure to ask for it on the rocks, without sugar to make it a bit more manly.Good mix of locals and hotel guests. Just know at youe getting into before you wander in., I think if I was 15 years older, I would have a different appreciation for this dark, red, basement bar. I guess Im just not comfortable seeing above middle aged women acting like `YAY we are drinking!!. Not a good sight. Good scotch list though, the12 year scotch is a great choice., I really wanted to love this place, I did. The place has a definite classy vibe to it. The place wasnt loud, crowded, or filled with annoying people, so thats a definite plus, but it wasnt an awesome experience. We stopped by after dinner on a Saturday night, looking for a quiet place for a few drinks. The caricatures of politicians on the walls made for some fun guess who games. And the martinis were well mixed and well portioned (and after 3 of them, it helped soften the blow of the bill). My main complaint would be that the place closed early (I guess all hotel bars do). Leaving us out on the street in the middle of our prime drinking time. At that point we just decided to call it a night. I would have probably rated it better if I had a few more drinks, but to the staffs credit, they didnt chase us out.Maybe this place would be better for an after work drink, but definitely not late in the evening., I didnt know what to expect when I agreed to meet at Off the Record, but I was pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere. Think of a dark, classy bar, with strong accents in Red. This is a place where you could see people of yesteryear sipping martinis and talking about politics. I got there at about 7pm on a Tuesday night and the crowd was a mix of hotel patrons and local office workers from around the area. It was a large crowd, but definitely smallish and we luckily got a table. As the night wore on the bar became more and more packed until about 10pm it was heaving. Now down to the drinks. I had a Stormy Weather ($15) and it was a smallish glass, but it was really good. I think if you have their signature drinks you shouldnt expect to be drinking them to get inebriated, but instead appreciating the handcrafting of the drink. The wine list was good, but as I remarked at one point in the evening, after 5 glasses of wine, we should have bought the entire bottle instead. It would have probably been cheaper. The food was good, and I would recommend the sampler with the mini-lamb chops ($18-ish) as they were fantastic and tasty and the hummus was equally good. Although, the menu said kalamata olives, I only counted about 6 - 8 on the plate, so I thought they could have had more. The other sample platter ($18-ish as well) had 2 beef skewers , 3 mini crab cakes (and when I say mini, I mean it), and 3 vegetarian wontons. Of all of those nibbles, the beef skewers and crab cakes were tasty, but the vegetarian wontons were bland and overcooked. Date Rating: 8 (good for special occasions, business dinners, or a nice quiet drink) Pick up Scale: 3 (mostly an older crowd and not a real pickup place, but there were quite a few single women while I was there), Great location, pleasant atmosphere, weekend bartender maybe doesnt know that much about cocktails. Great if youre just looking for wine, beer, or very standard cocktails (or their own signature cocktails) with a great DC vibe. I wouldnt recommend ordering off the menu.We popped in on Valentines day in the early evening (it was a Sunday this year) for a pre-dinner cocktail. As lovers of classic cocktails, we both felt that this would be a safe spot to order off the menu. I ordered a vesper, and my husband ordered a sazerac. Whoops. Our bartender knew how to make neither. When he said he wasnt sure what went into a vesper, I should have doubled back and ordered something more mainstream, but instead I told him the ingredients, forgot to specify Lillet Blonde, and got myself a festive red vesper made with Lillet Rouge. It was tasty, but not what I had in mind. Ill take the blame on this one. Then it became apparent that he also didnt know how to make a sazerac, and asked the other bartender, who wasnt quite sure either, but the husband ended up with some semblance of the drink he ordered. Not quite right, but ok. Basically, if youre used to the precision and depth of knowledge that is kind of over-the-top in the NYC classic cocktail realm, the Sunday night bartenders here might not be able to meet your needs.Particular cocktail mishaps aside, Im definitely not writing this place off. The pours were strong and the atmosphere was quite nice. Its steps from the White House, and would be a great spot to take out-of-town friends after (or during) a day of sightseeing.Bonus: Possibly due to White House proximity, politicos are sighted here regularly. While no super-famous folks were there when we went, there was a very colorful woman who came in alone, sat at the bar, and loudly told her story of her work with the McCain campaign to the two tourists sitting next to her. Good for some quiet giggles for us., Location, location, location. Off the Records got it. This classic hotel bar is located in the basement of the Hay Adams and is like something out of a movie set. You emerge and across Lafayette Sqauare sits the White House in the background.It definitely has a mens clubby vibe going for it: red walls with pencil caricatures of politicians adorning them, great wood and plaster molding, nice nooks for intimate conversation; this is a place where you would never feel overdressed. The drinks list reflects that: nice selection of wines by the glass and classic cocktails, but expect to spend about $15 a pop for the latter., This is one of my favorite places in DC. Its a rare gem that is great for locals and tourists alike. I eventually take every visitor there and universally theyve loved it. The location is obviously fantastic with its proximity to the White House. I truly like everything about this bar. You walk down the stairs and feel like you are entering into old Washington. The rich wood, the little alcove seating, the servers that you know have overhead some interesting conversations...I feel smarter and sexier and wittier when Im there. In addition to a fine Manhattan they have delicious mezze platter that includes lamb chops. They also have really yummy bar snacks that are complimentary...and none of this Costco chex mix we are talking nice olives and some dry snacks. Drinks are pricey but I think they are worth every penny., Take the red pill, go down the rabbit hole and fall into a red velvet dream lounge... Trevor, youe not in Wonderland, youe at Off The Record and personally the name says it all. I want to have a libation, enjoy the atmosphere...soak it in and let the red pill do the rest...I just hope that wasn a ruffie. Located in what seems to be the basement of the Hay-Adams Hotel lies a pristine establishment. Think what if the Bull and Finch and the Red Robin Bar were to have love child bar with amazing elegance and the service of a great bar...this would be it. Though, the focus seems to be the bar itself, the real tantalizing focus is on how you can actually seem to want to lounge and enjoy yourself. Pictures/caricatures of infamous politicians deck the walls only seem to underscore how incredibly relaxed and unpretentious the bar is considering that within minutes youe at the White House and in the heart of politics in DC. It almost just winks ever so coyly to say, I can tell that a subpeona in your pocket and do you care for a drink? I had the David Washingtonian. A somewhat sweet drink, but the house made sour blend cut it making it just a perfect afternoon drink. The knobby sidecar on the other end of the spectrum is probably the real reason why you come here to forget the mistakes the previous night or session on the Floor. Decided to get some sliders and opted for the lobster and crab cake sliders. What a great duo. One cold and one hot, but perfectly balanced with the drinks. I could just lounge here for hours...Lord knows the pill is finally taking effect on my reasoning. Enjoy yourself here, have a libation and call it an afternoon and stay Off The Record., Loses a star due to the noise level. Even in the early hours (6PM) there was a din. By the time Sugar and I rolled out it was as if a concert started. I like a lively room but the sound just has no place to go. Saying this we arrived early and got a nice table in the back in which I got to drink in not only the wonderful libations in this prohibition-esque bar, but also all that Sugar had to offer. She was dressed in pink underneath black and showed off all the features I love about her. ( P.S. her legs are hypnotic.) We simply had drinks and moved on into the night to our dinner location. Bar menu was well a bar menu. Not what we had in mind so we sipped on Champagne and Viognier, exchanged gifts and glances and went on our Merry way. Waitstaff was attentive and helpful. Place was well appointed and comfortable. We will return I am sure., Great winter bar, warm atmosphere, if not a little over the top with the decor. Surprisingly affordable, good food, but really worth the visit for a cocktail at the bar. My only complaint is that, each time I go there, i feel like Im purposely being ignored by the bartender - at least initially. Is that just me?, Wow. What a fantastic place! Im from northern Virginia but Ive never really spent much time in the city until tonight. My friend from NY suggested Off the Record and we walked from the Smithsonian to have drinks there tonight. We were led inside by the doorman of the hotel and our bartender made a dirty martini and their signature Washingtonian cocktail for us as soon as we walked in. They were both great. My friend had the chicken quesodilla and I had french onion soup, both delicious. Our bartender Mikhal (sp?) was really, really nice. He even comped our last two drinks! Im a server myself and this was some of the best service Ive had (a) but more importantly the mixology and the food were both on point. Id strongly recommend this place to anyone who is venturing into the city. Its right off the main drag and for being a historical, somewhat posh place its super friendly and inviting. Thanks for the great time Off the Record!, Dressy and upscale, but lively, fun and unpretentious. I recently finished my graduate studies, and decided to celebrate here with the friends of my study group. We arrived on a Friday at 7pm, got one of the few remaining tables and indulged ourselves for the evening with drinks and an overwhelming selection of appetizers. My Grey Goose martinis were blissfully potent, while my friends were happy with their drinks, which included mimosas and their grapefruit and basil mojitos. The appetizers were scrumptious--the grilled haloumi and lamb with hummus along with the sauteed wild mushrooms were otherworldly, and we also enjoyed the edamame dumplings and truffled potato sticks. One of my friends is vegetarian and did not drink alcohol, but she was satisfied with the options.The ambiance has a strong strain of traditional, almost Old World culture, its but inviting rather than stuffy. I was the only person who was dressed up, and one of my friends wore jeans, but we never felt out of place or intimidated. Our waiter was excellent, unobtrusively checking in at regular but not too-frequent intervals during the course of the evening, and the rest of the wait staff was pleasant and accommodating. As one might imagine on a Friday, the place filled up over the course of the evening and got louder, but not to the point of having to shout to be heard.A nice place for a laid-back celebration., I wasnt expecting to be blown away.... not at all! The location feels seductive and politically influential... just a few steps away from Obama but hidden away in the basement of the Hay Adams exclusive hotel. Warm red and plush interiors, hob nobbing types and other such important looking people.. who knew politics and sexy mixed so well?! (-:The crab cake and regular burgers (slider version) were actually (and surprisingly) out of this world delicious. There was definitely some special and unique sauce on those bad boys because man oh man were they heavenly. Up there with the best burgers Ive had anywhere, for sure! Im still dreaming of these burgers. Pass on the truffle fries - they were thick and soggy and barely tasted of truffle. The regular fries were definitely better.Dont forget to ask for a yummy homemade cookie as you pass the front desk to leave the hotel. A perfect treat to the end of the dinner., Classy, classy, classy, classy. Stopped for a drink with the bachelorette crew after having taken pictures in front of the White House. Just a little DC stereotype, right?Our waiter was helpful and always around if we needed anything - I ordered a Pimms Cup, which arrived with a delicious strawberry, some basil, and a long cucumber that provided a wonderful fresh touch to the drink. After a long day of wine tasting, the refreshing and earthy Pimms was exactly what the doctor ordered. At $15 its a little pricey, but I didnt expect anything less, and we were not disappointed., Once upon a time this was a major den for pollies, journos, lobbyists and everything in between ... but now it seems like a past-its-prime bar that is a little too well lit, and therefore feels a bit brash, rather than full of boozy secrets and political gossip. It just seems to clean! The politicos now have their meetings at Starbucks, or at breakfast fundraisers, and Off the Record caters to tourists like us. All that being said, its still a fun place to come. The Pimms Cup was really fantastic - zing zing zing. Happy to pay the price for that mother of a cocktail. We enjoyed ourselves but decided to hunt out a place that felt more intimate and ... well, fun. PS: GREAT womens toilets. Really luxurious. But having classy toilets does not maketh a great bar, Im afraid., After we left The Hamilton, my colleagues and I werent quite ready to call it a night. My partner suggested a place he thought we might like at the bottom of the Hay-Adams. As soon as we walked in, I was smitten! I loved the coziness and joviality of Off the Record. We snuggled into a small alcove near the front and ordered our drinks. My Pimms Cup was perfect. The decor reminded me of a friendly parlor and I really enjoyed the intimacy of the place., This little pub reminded us (on the outside) of Cheers. On the inside, you feel like youve snuck into underground DC. Very sweet, classy yet casual, elegant but reasonable. Great staff. My boyfriend and I both had the burger, although I got mine without the bun (Im gluten free), and we both got truffle fries, except I asked for mine extra crispy. We also shared the crab bisque special. Heres the rub: our burgers were different. We both enjoyed them, but his had tomatoes and raw onions, and mine didnt. Interesting.  Our fries were exactly the same color (ie: mine were not crispy), I had 5 fries and he had 6. We both ate exactly 1 fry each because we didnt care for them.  the crab bisque came, and of course, was clearly containing flour. So I didnt really eat it, he loved it, and the waiter apologized profusely for not thinking to check with the kitchen about that. (I hadnt asked, but he knew I was having the burger without the bun for exactly that reason). Still, my boyfriend thought it was the best burger ever, and it was a very lovely place. And quiet, but with a TV. So wed probably go back. But get the regular fries...much better., We loved this place - we heard they had Delerium on tap; thats what brought us in the door. Friendly bar staff and delicious food and beverages. We enjoyed looking at all the caricatures on the walls too., Great place to grab a drink and some good food. The bartenders are great., Cute place - great service and tasty food. I ordered a Pimms - large and delicious though a bit sweet for me. The burger sliders were tasty, the fries - meh., Solid drinks at fair prices. Happy hour can be a little crowed, but isnt that the point anyway. Pretty much a solid bar with good food, and good patrons. Recommend going there and experiencing it for yourself., Pricey, but swank. Most bars serve peanuts--they serve gourmet olives and kettle chips.High-class, and great drinks. The only downside, the drinks can tip toward the expensive end, but that doesnt detract from the great decor and service., Great bar snacks! Been a while since I have had gourmet olives and assorted nuts served complimentary with my drink. Old fashioned cocktail was good. Had the key lime pie and assorted house made sorbet which was awesome! Great place, elegant but relaxed atmosphere, and friendly waitstaff. Looking forward to returning in the future., What in the flying fxck does ld world charmlook like? I scoffed, skimming the other reviews. And then I found my way inside (locked direct door requires access through the hotel) and really, there just no better phrase to describe the vibe here. I am barely sophisticated enough for this place. Lots of after-work suits milling about in a jovial fashion. John is as charming a bartender as the newspaper articles have made him out to be, feigning amazement and deep respect at my drinking choices. Olives and chips at the bar. Food menu runs basic. Decor reverberates weathered opulence. Lovely atmosphere and scotch selection, proper damn pours at DC prices. Before Jack Rose set up shop in AdMo, OTR woulde scored a 5 stars from me, but this level of class is just fluff. Who needs a peat mistress just to make myself feel fancy, now that I have a peat wife so close to home?, What a bar! fantastic bar staff, fantastic atmosphere, fantastic drinks. This place is intimate and cozy. The cocktail are great as are the corn nuts and olives you get when you sit down.Sit at the bar or in one of the cozy nooks, you cant go wrong. I cant wait to bring other people here, which says it all really.Lots of the people in the bar when we were, were treating themselves to a little Prue dinner tipple. But you could easily make this your all night stop too, if you want somewhere quiet to enjoy each others company and wash the conversation down with something delectable.Be prepared for the price point, but if you appreciate a really classy bar that feels like its got some pedigree behind it you wont be disappointed., Drinks were delicious ($15 cocktails better be, I suppose) - on a Saturday night, it was rather empty, so the group of us were able to enjoy a private booth sitting with no pressure. The only awful part was the deconstructed apple cheesecake. Oh please, the minute crunch bubbles are not crust., I remember my first visit to Off the Record and thought it was a old school elegance and an interesting place with interesting people to stop in and have a drink. We loved the potato chips that were served with our drinks and the old timer bartender. Now that has all changed we stopped in to have a drink and noticed the changes. First no chips, instead we were given nuts and corn nuts, the bartender was gone and the atmosphere was lacking. The service was not the same and there appeared to be an undercurrent between the employees there. Rather weird. It is a shame that Off the Record has lost its appeal and atmosphere.With no potato chips there is no reason for us to stop for a drink. It is Off my Record., Is it just me or can anyone else not say the Hay in Hay Adams like Heeeeey? While Ie dined in their restaurant (it has a lovely view of the White House, and if you need to impress Daddy Warbucks, well here a good spot to do it...), I found myself at Off the Record enjoying a nightcap to a wonderful West Wing Christmas tour--can it get any more DC than that??!Yes, it comfortably achieves its goal of classy, politico, somewhat pretentious old money vibe. The staff is attentive, the cocktails well balanced, and it has a beautiful scotch and port selection. As others have mentioned, the dish of assorted nuts, olives, and corn nuts (!! random but props for the tongue-in-cheek nod to its bar-reality), was welcomed. The food was decent, although they ignored my cheese-free housemate request to hold the manchego from the St. John sandwich. It has a cool, vibe, and I did value the quiet, playful somberness.So why only 3 stars? There was nothing really pulling me here. Everything was just...barely above ok in comparison to the cost. While the server knew proper serving and pouring of libation techniques (which is impressive), he could not engage with me with regards to single malts, ports, or wine. My housemate received her food improperly, and overall, while I had an enjoyable time, I realized it was likely from the company and that the place, while a decent backdrop, did not contribute as much as I would have liked.Will I go back? Sure, I have no reason not to go. When will I go back? Probably when I next invited, as I have no real reason to go, either., Fantastic BarI have a blackmail photo of a congressman canoodling with a pretty (drunk) young intern :)Im a big fan of dark old wood paneled bars with a bit of history or inside gorgeous places. I loved the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis and the Oak Room at the Plaza in NYC when I wanted to feel like a grown-up and was looking fancy :) Now that I AM a grown-up the novelty has worn off a little...unless like this place its done soooo right.Off the record had great bartenders who made very yummy drinks and the food was perfect (not just delicious but well seasoned and perfectly cooked). What more can you ask for?, We came here in the afternoon to celebrate the engagement of our friends. Since we got there a little early we sat at the bar and ordered drinks and lunch. The Martini I got was fantastic and they even have stuffed olives! Its certainly not the cheapest place to eat, but for a special occasion its definitely worth it., Had a great time. Great for people watching, drinks were great (I had the Sidecar, partner had the pear martini) and wine. bar snacks yummy, lamb chops spectacular. Would love to go back., Great place...typically quiet, although can get wound up.The tuna nicoise is amazing...as is the filet and pate... The staff are all just perfect.I love this place!, I ordered a draft Stella but it had a lot of foam. The bartender said he would fill it up after the foam went down. Five minutes later he comes over with another beer almost full. What great service! I wouldnt spend an entire night their, but its a nice place for a couple drinks heading back to your room or a night on the town., Watched one of the NCAA games here. The place was soooooo busy and I was surprised at the mix of clientele. The hotel is a favorite of mine and my husband while staying in DC which is often. The bar is downstairs and cozy with TV, a great bar and great tables to sit at. If in DC and want to go for drinks late night this is a great place. Make sure to visit if you are near the whitehouse., This is a really nice bar - classy and posh with super expensive drinks. I had a margarita that someone here wrote was the best in town. It was fricking $16! And not even the best Ive had. But good.Well, as i said a nice bar, but dont go here for great draught beer. Our waiter didnt even know what ales they had. Or even what ale is..?We was a bit hungry and ordered sliders. This is new to me - but I like it! Small burgers! The snack menu was ok but the sliders were a bit on the dry side.All and all we had a nice evening out - I guess this is were you go for afterwork (aw) before going home or getting on.They accept AMEX., Great Cocktails! the food is good too.... right by the white house. If youre in DC, this is the place to be, I had a business meeting here - and after taking a cab to this building, and go the wrong way on the stairs (going up five floors, before realizing its on the below ground floor. A little humor at the end of a long day...) I find myself a very charming and charismatic bar.This bar is reminiscent of old bars I see in history books, fine wooden furniture, ornate walls, furniture. A dark, formal, sultry setting, dotted with couples or business groups in business or formal attire. This is a bar intended for gatherings of a bit more upscale in nature. Once I sat down, I immediately drawn towards the caricatures of politicians current and past, rather curious editorial views of each subject. Anyway, I began to peruse the menu, printed on a heavy paper, it had nice feel to it. The menu does contain a good selection of alcohol and assorted meals, ranging from light appetizers to entrees. For starters, we had the Cheese Platter and Charcuterie Platter. I never had a Charcuterie platter before, but I must say I did enjoy my exploration of this cuisine. The coppa was my favorite, and the prosciutto had a great amount of flavor and really tender texture to it. Cheese platter was evenly enjoyable as well, there was different bleu cheese that Ill remember, nothing that Ive seen in a regular grocery store. I would recommend just ordering these two platters by themselves, with drinks, its enough to for 2 or 4 people. :-)I also had the Tuna Nicoise Salad as well; perfectly seared tuna. Very tender, and still savory. The potatoes were perfectly seasoned and done, and the greens were crisp. This is a salad to be ordered and enjoyed. All in all- for a formal atmosphere to host a meeting, or go for a date, this is truly a spot to stop by, take in the atmosphere, and enjoy a good meal., two words: davids washingtoniani dont know who this david guy is, but he mustve done something right to deserve this brilliant cocktail named after him., Off The Record has the kind of masculine sophistication that almost (very briefly) makes me wish I was a top hat wearing middle aged white man so I could make this my go-to bar for a stiff drink after a long day of doing very important business stuff and playing politics; Or where I could take my trophy wife, or secret lover.Despite being quite the opposite of all that I am absolutely smitten by this red velvet draped bar, because there is something unquestionably sexy and mysterious about it. Maybe its the idea of having a finely crafted potent cocktail in a cleverly hidden hotel bar; Or the fact that the location, right opposite the White House, is so classically Washington DC. But I think the appeal really comes from all the dim lighting and leather d39cor and cozy nooks they have set up all around the edges. And the fact that their bartenders have a generous pour making you want to lounge around for hours.I had the Davids Washingtonian which, in a sea of whiskey drinkers, looked even fruitier than it really is; but it was delicious and remarkably potent. My friends Dark N Stormy and classic Old Fashioned on the other hand appeared to be the drinks most people seemed to be ordering that night.Off The Record is a flat out gorgeous bar that almost reeks of power. It is not the kind of bar you get drunk at, but rather very... slowly... intoxicated. And ideally over a period of several hours. It will be worth your time., Off the Record should be renamed Off the Chain! Basically, this is a hidden basement bar beneath the Hay Adams Hotel and directly across the South Lawn of the White House. The bar is a mix of lobbyist, tourist, and Yelp misfits. I was recently introduced to this place from a Yelp Ghost Tour, and I love it so much! The bar is beautifully decorated with red walls, a circular bar, and political caricatures everywhere. The bartenders are older than dirt but they can pour a great cocktail. Also a MUST TRY is the turtle cheesecake- it will change your life., This spot might be a little bit too fancy for me. I came as a part of a drinking tour and it seems like a good spot but possibly too rich for my blood.Place is on the small side but as I believe it is a hotel bar, that should be expected. Nice decor, interesting pictures on the wall, nice old school charm with wood furniture.Most of the clientele appeared to be of the business variety, the White House is right across the street so I can image this being a political or media hot-spot.Staff was friendly, I had John as my bartender apparently he is world famous and he did a good job of taking orders quickly and efficiently.I had the Primms Cup and it was strong and well made.Worth a visit, but be prepared to open the purse strings., Ie always wanted to check out those politico bars / pubs around DC Ie often heard about. Back in my grad school days we just always stick to the cheap divey bars -- no problem with that. Happen to be having dinner nearby so thought we check it out for after dinner drinks. The place is in the basement of the Hay-Adams Hotel. It definitely an upper end watering hole for a quiet drink and conversations that need to stay off the record. (Haha!) Old school decor. However, be prepared for outrageous price drinks. The small list of mixed cocktails were $16 per drink. Although, the size was huge and made quite strong. So, I guess youe getting a healthy amount of alcohol for the price. All 4 of us only had 1 drink each and the bill came to over $80. Go for the novelty of the atmosphere but not if youe looking to get your drinks on., Located on the lower level of the Hay Adams hotel by the White House, Off The Record is definitely one of those bars that immediately come to mind when watching shows like Mad Men or House of Cards. This was the first stop for my friends birthday celebration bar crawl since we wanted to start off with some slow intoxication before going harder. All of us were amazed by the level of easy sophistication, yet Off The Record doesnt even try to be. We were lucky to have John as our bartender from the reviews on Yelp as well as the Washingtonian years ago. Friendly and even giving me shit for having my phone out briefly was entertaining. We were also very much entertained by the older gentlemen drinking at the bar as we all ended up talking for hours. I guess we came on a good night as we met some pretty high level (although now retired) DC natives. The only cocktail I tried here was the Old Fashioned as we were drinking rye neats. Although not the best Ive had, it is quite good and I very much enjoyed just sitting at the bar talking with new friends and company. This place is not cheap as that each Bulliet neat was $16 each. I will say that because it was my friends birthday, John was extremely kind in that he only charged us for two drinks. Does it bother me that the drinks here are quite expensive? Not really. Youre paying for the experience and the atmosphere as well as some well made cocktails. I look forward to coming back considering the type of people youre likely to meet., Such a cool spot to take your visiting out-of-towners and splurge on a $16 martini. A great place to people watch and try to guess which of the patrons actually works at the white house. Enjoyed the caricature drawings of washington politico hot-shots on the wall. Service was super fast and the complimentary olives/wasabe peas/nuts were much appreciated., Really cool bar in the lower level of the Hay Adams Hotel. This place has a cool lounge vibe to it. The cocktails are pricey at $16 but the atmosphere is great and the little snack plate they bring is a nice touch., Quite liked this bar! I stayed at the Hay-Adams so it was super convenient to start my nights here.The ambiance is classy. The drinks are strong. The bar food was surprisingly good. The bartender was really friendly. And theres free wasabi peas! And TVs to watch whatever games are in season.Great place to start the night.
51|osteria-morini-washington|We just finished a great dinner at Osteria Morini. Chef Michael White new DC establishment is a welcome sight in the burgeoning southeast neighborhood. We had very attentive service from Emma, our waitress, and Cesar, the sommelier. The parmigiano gelato crostini was great! The expansive wine list was also a great addition. I have high hopes for this restaurant and we will be back again soon!, This was an excellent restaurant. The ambiance is relaxed but elegant, the staff are attentive, polite and knowledgeable, and everything we ordered was delicious. The crostini (especially the Parmesan gelato) were a great, shareable appetizer (we ordered 3 to split between 2 people). Similarly, the cheese selection was well done. Everything was beautifully presented. My dining companion was blown away by his guanciale salad and lasagna verde. I had the Stracci, homemade wide ribbon pasta with mushrooms, and it was great. My only concern is that the menu had virtually no vegetarian options. As someone who eats some fish and poultry, but not red meat or pork, I found that I was limited to only a handful of main dishes. The pasta dish I ordered was the only vegetarian pasta, which is a shame. It would be great if they would expand with one or two more vegetarian pastas to ensure several options for everyone. Given the the limited vegetarian options, I would consider returning occasionally, but for a similar quality of food and price point Ill stick to Acqua al 2 for more regular dinners, as they have more veggie-friendly options., Impossible to imagine how this new addition to the Navy Yard neighborhood gets less than 5 Yelp stars. Classic rock playing at just the right volume, a very comfortable and hip country formal decor, over-the-top-service, a very nice menu, and perfectly prepared food. Wonderful, salty focaccia. Five meat antipasto was perfect for three to four people at $25. Seafood salad was very fresh and tasty with green olive slices and a real value at $14. Home made Agnolotti and gnocchi were perfect (although you should expect European size pasta portions, and at $20, for me this was OK, but we would have appreciated portions about 25 percent larger). Cant speak for the main entree proteins on this first visit. Cappuccino was prepared perfectly. Lemon torte is one of the best desserts we have ever tasted; dangerously good! Warm chocolate cake explodes with warm chocolate ganache. Very enjoyable meal!! Made reservations to come back next Wednesday when our daughter comes home for college! Love this place!!!, Perhaps I visited with too high expectations. Frequented the Manhattan locations for years. Every single experience, superb. As for the SE DC locations, not bad, but clearly not Morini of New York City. Firstly, flavors do not explode in your mouth as they do in the NYC location. Crostinis were all very good, especially the trout. Stracci lacked depth in flavor. Brodetto was too sweet with too little seafood for a $24 (?) soup. Spaghetti was very good. Another pasta w. clams was also very good but got too salty when we reached the bottom of the bowl. My gin and tonic was excellent. Service, top notch. Servers are well educated. Bus boys are attentive. May still rank as one of the nicer casual italian restaurants in the city but has a few early-stage obstacles to overcome for it to become a true top notch like the morini in manhattan., PROS:+Delicious pasta and sauce. And meatballs. The sauce isnt super chunky and overly sweet like American sauces. The hand made pasta was delicious and al dente.+The pancetta, sausage, and lamb was great. The seabass was good, but not amazing.+20% off your bill for a few weeksCONS:-The music choice and volume was a bit meh and too loud, respectively. I think the place needs a bit of acoustic work because it was hard to hear people speak sometimes.-Portion sizes. Theyre small. Id liked to have seen about 25% more all across the board. Im a hungry guy, and I cant break the bank just to get full. This place is not exactly cheap.Amazing experience, friendly staff and service. Things went mostly smoothly, which is impressive because it was opening weekend., I am giving this three stars because this restaurant has only stupid problem problems. The food was fantastic. We started with a couple of appetizers: an 18 month prosciutto and meatballs were delicious. As entrees we had the tagliatelle and the cappeletti. Both were delicious. Generally, unless something is really good or really bad, I rate on three things: food service and venue. I have already covered food. Service and venue leave something to be desired. Venue. I get it. More tables equals more money. Unfortunately, that does not make a very comfortable dinner. It does however make for a crowded space and makes it more difficult to serve food. Additionally, Osteria Morini chose to obstruct the view of the river with the entrance. Service was eh. Our waitress was unfamiliar with the term, personal space. Despite the aforementioned lack of breathing room, she took it upon herself to bend over when reading the menu options. This method served two purposes. First, it allowed her to give the adjacent table an up close and personal view of her bottom while at the same time allowed her the opportunity to check my tonsils. Success on both accounts. Dont ask about the family style tapas style. Basically, whatever answer they give you translates into, we charge more for smaller portions., This should get four and a half stars. I hesitate and round down to four only because I think five stars should be reserved for the best of the best.My date and I went here on a cold, Arctic Monday evening on the spur of the moment. We expected a deserted restaurant given the temperature and day of the week, but were surprised that there was a comfortable crowd; a good sign for the first few weeks of one of DC most anticipated restaurants of the year.We sampled a few small plates from the menu: the seafood salad (Mare), three types of spreads for crostini (smoked trout, winter squash, and the parmesan gelato), and the bucatini (pasta with seafood). Sense a theme?My date is not a heavy meat eater, and I suspect that a vegetarian may struggle at Osteria Morini. The Mare salad was amazing, the texture of the octopus perfect, and the mixture of green Spanish olives and Kalamata olives a nice offset to the fishiness of the seafood. My date backed away from another salad that included pork jowl, which is at the top of my list of items to try for future dates. And I will certainly be returning.Service was very helpful in maneuvering through a often foreign sounding menu. Descriptions on the menu itself were helpful, but I found asking the server to be the best way to figure out the orders for the night. For a Monday night the crowd was noticeable, but not significant. Our service was admirable for balancing the desire to make sure we were taken care of, including waters filled, bread supply sufficient, and beverages constant, with the need to not hover over us during a slow night. Even if you are not hungry for a full meal, I will recommend sitting at the bar, ordering a drink or two (or three?) and trying a few of the spreads for the crostini. Although we had planned on ordering a pasta from the start, the crostini was surprisingly filling and we could have stopped our night there. Given the diversity in the three we tried, I am confident that there something for everyone. The winter squash did have speck on it, which could discourage a strict vegetarian. I enjoyed the smoked trout the most, the olives again serving as a confident companion to the seafood, but I would suggest the parmesan gelato, with the aged balsamic, as a safe choice for a group with varied tastes.Before delving into the pasta, Il note that I enjoyed the music, which was an electric mix of classic rock ranging from Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young to the Eagles. No, it not your traditional Italian restaurant lineup, and perhaps you could request Frank Sinatra if you really wanted, but Il go with Neil Young any evening. Others have noted that the pasta portions are small, and I would ideally have wanted either a larger portion or a cheaper price to allow me to pick and split two pasta dishes. The authentic pasta is heavily advertised, but of the courses was perhaps the biggest (relative) let down, given the higher expectations. A good night out could have skipped the pasta and focus on other dishes.If we had skipped the pasta, we might have saved room for dessert. I wish we had. The menu was teasing, it is yet another reason to return. It falls short of a five star rating, but this will fast become one of the jewels of the growing Navy Yard neighborhood., I visited on Friday Nov 22nd and with the restaurant having only been open a few days, they definitely had their act together minus a few newbie obstacles they will overcome in the next few weeks. You could tell the wait staff was a little nervous but it did not impede on the quality of service. The water glasses were quickly re-filled, the waiter was knowledgeable and helpful with the menu. The floor managers were discretely surveying the floor and motioning to the staff if something needed tending to. My friend and I walked in without a reservation and decided to wait at the bar for a table. When we were being seated, the hostess carried our drinks to the table on a tray (nice little touch). The food was Amazing! We started with the Testa, moved on to the Pipette pasta (highly recommend) and then to the Branzino. The pipette pasta was the PERFECT Fall weather dish and the Branzino (highly recommend) was full of natural flavor. I don like when Fish is served with an overwhelming sauce and this was not the case here. I thought I was full by the time it came around to dessert but when I saw the Panna Cotta (highly recommend) I had to try it and I glad I did. Another great Fall dish, and the Pumpkin Seeds and Aged Balsamic were a nice addition.I will say it did seem like there are too many tables in the allotted space. I don mind being close to other tables when dining, however I was sitting at a 2 top which felt like was right in the main alleyway. Overall, it was a great experience and I can wait to frequent!, My friend and I went right after they opened and sat at the bar. Our bartender and bar back were amazing and we had the best service ever. The beverage manager even stopped by to say hi. The food was great and the decor was fantastic! There were lots of people there and its in a great location for summer right on the water!, Outstanding service; mouth-watering food; eye-watering prices. We took some out of town friends to Osteria Morini on Friday, 11/29/2013. We really enjoyed the food and the overall experience, but found the prices--particularly for the wine--to be a bit excessive, even with the 20% discount. The location is fantastic, tucked in behind Yards Park on the banks of the Anacostia River, just a short walk from the Navy Yard Metro. The glass walls should provide excellent views during daylight hours. The physical restaurant is an open space with high ceilings and tables packed closely together. The tables are so dense that it was hard to even plot out a path from the host station to our table. Once seated, however, the restaurant seemed to shrink around us into a little cocoon, despite our position in the middle of the seating area. I was shocked by how quiet it seemed and how easy it was to carry on a conversation across the table. Other reviewers have mentioned the noise, so perhaps this was just a quirk of our particular table, since the restaurant was quite busy. Speaking of noise, the music in the restaurant was a bit off-putting. At first I enjoyed Led Zeppelin Kashmir, but when I got back to the table and heard Journey Don Stop Believing, and Lynyrd Skynyrd Freebird, it became a bit much. An Italian restaurant at this price range deserves better ambience than a crappy classic-rock Pandora station. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable, suggesting a variety of appetizers and entrees. To start, we had the affettati, with one each of prosciutto, soppressata, and parmigiano, as well as the crostini, with one each of the parmigiano, zucca, and manzo. The meats and cheeses were all excellent, and unlike many charcuterie/cheese plates, actually came with sufficient toast points. The crostini consisted of a mousse/pate-like substance in each flavor, served with the crostini (aka toast points). I really enjoyed the manzo crostini, which was like an Italian beef tartare. The zucca (squash) was also tasty and seasonally appropriate. The parmigiano, however, lacked any real parmesan flavor, and instead just tasted creamy. For an entree, I ordered the tagliatelle al ragu, my wife and one of my friends ordered the stracci ai funghi, while my other friend ordered the lasagna verde. I chose the tagliatelle since the restaurant specializes in pasta and food from the Emilia-Romagna region. It didn disappoint. The sauce was good and lived up to its authentic billing. I might have liked my pasta a bit more al dente, but that would be hard to get perfect given both the size of the restaurant and the density of the sauce. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their choices, as evidenced by the empty plates. Thankfully, the portion sizes were restrained, which allowed room for dessert. The desserts were the highlight of the meal. We shared the tortino al cioccolato and the semifreddo di gianduia. Both were outstanding. The tortino had a nice warm gooey center and was served with a side of delicious espresso gelato on a bed of espresso grounds (mixed with chocolate?). Given the rather glowing review thus far, why only 3 stars? Well, for about $70 per person (before discount) without having ordered bottles of wine and ordering only pasta (thereby avoiding the much more expensive meat and fish secondi), this quality of food and service ought to be a given. Still, the prices of the food, although a bit high for Italian and the neighborhood were only a couple dollars out of whack. The real issue was the wine list. For a restaurant that claims that, The wine list includes affordable wine selections, having the same number of sub-$40 bottles of red wine on the list as there are $300-plus red bottles (three of each) is insulting. I certainly don expect this level of restaurant to fill its wine list with $22 bottles of mediocre wine, but just a handful of reds in the $28-$38 range (a nice primitivo perhaps?) would have been well received by our group. None of the affordable reds on offer caught our eye, so we ordered by the glass. The house red was inoffensive, but boring at $10/glass. The super tuscan was much better, but at $16/glass, it ought to be. Osteria Morini does allow for corkage at a rate of $25/bottle, but it only allows one corking per table, and the wine can be anything on the existing list. I usually don bring my own bottles, but if I came back to Morini I probably consider it. In summary, Osteria Morini serves excellent food in a great atmosphere with helpful, efficient, and knowledgable staff. Unfortunately, the restaurant seems to be catering to a corporate/lobbyist clientele that can afford to put $340 bottles of wine on an expense account. So, while I glad to have them in the neighborhood, I not sure if wel make a return visit unless someone else is paying., Terrific pasta. We come here for the pasta but was surprised when we ordered, bit hesitantly, the apps and dessert. The crostinis were terrific and dessert was delicious. The price IS a bit high but come on -- its worth it. A great place for special occasions., Went for a 6:45 PM dinner on Sunday night. Had reservations and we had no problem getting seated on time. It actually seemed a bit empty - maybe because it was on the Sunday right after Thanksgiving? So heres the breakdown...- Ambience: Good. Aside from a big screen tv near the bar, the place looks very nice. Plus they have huge windows that overlook the water.- Service: Great. They were really on top of things. They also have a coat check at the door which is a nice feature. Our waiter (and the manager?) gave us recommendations for food and wine. Our meal came out in a timely manner.- Drinks: Good. We ordered 2 cocktails - barrys grog (yuuum!) and the fiori darancio (eh. tasted like a jack and coke). We also had 2 glasses of red wine (the bottles were very pricey). I had the red on tap (pretty good) and my boyfriend had the pelisa (we liked his better.. a bit bolder) - Food: Good but could be better.. To start, we had the complimentary bread which is very tasty. For an appetizer, we shared 2 meats (coppa and a salami which isnt listed on their online menu) and 1 cheese (fiaco de capro). Again, tasty.. it came with plenty of bread, and some lard fat spread (sounds gross and Im sure is not good for you but tasted great!). For entrees, we had 2 pastas. I had the tagliatelle. Good sized portion but the noodles were a bit thin and may have been a tad overcooked (?). Still worth getting. My boyfriend had the lumache. Came out of the kitchen lukewarm, the portion seemed small (especially compared to the tagliatelle), and the taste was not memorable. I wouldnt recommend this dish. We had heard that the portions were a bit small so we also ordered a side of spinach... very buttery and tasty. We skipped dessert.Overall an enjoyable experience. However, the prices are high for what you get. We had 20% off our food bill (since we had dined in the first 2 weeks of the opening). Im glad because I wouldnt want to pay full price.The manager spoke to us on the way out and said that he wished it was more crowded. He mentioned that some people are having problems finding the location because GPS doesnt show the correct address. I could see that being an issue... but, I could also understand if the prices are keeping others away. There are plenty of other places in DC where you can get just as good of an experience for less money., Came here for a friend birthday dinner this past weekend. Overall, we had a great experience food-wise.One thing to know: even if youe made a reservation, they won seat your whole party until every person is there.Osteria Morini just opened, so a few flubs were to be expected. These came only in the form of the service.My friends had ordered drinks at the bar before I got there. When I arrived and said we were ready for our table, two guys at the host stand (and there were about EIGHT PEOPLE working at the host stand) conferred amongst each other who would carry the drinks on a tray to our table. We thought this was sort of weird--the table couldn have been more than 20 feet away. Also, once we sat down, the guy forgot who had which glass of wine. When this is your only job and there are only two glasses of wine, it probably a good idea to get this straight.Our waitress was perfectly nice, if awkward, and spent about three minutes going on about her favorite things on each section of the menu, but assuring us that everything is amazing. We ordered the polpettine, tortellini in brodo, cappeletti, agnolotti, and stracci. However, the first thing that came out was a giant cheese and meat board. Compliments of the chef, we were told by one of the managers. Sliced salami of some kind, Robiola cheese, chicken and duck liver pate, some kind of beet spread, assorted breads and toast, and the biggest pile of prosciutto Ie ever seen. Seriously, it was the size of a softball. I know that this won happen once theye past their soft opening stage, but whatever--it was delicious.At every course, they cleared our silverware and gave us new sets. One of us even got a new paper placemat, which was kind of strange and unnecessary.The food was amazing, which is why I giving this four stars. It priced higher than I want to spend normally, but because it was 20% off, it was worth it. Everything was luscious, perfectly seasoned, and flavorful. The tortellini in brodo was incredible--Parmesan-flavored broth and meaty tortellini. Plus, they split it into two bowls, which was a really nice touch (when we ordered it, we said two of us were splitting it). The stracci was probably the best pasta dish--rich mushrooms and a great rosemary flavor, plus the homemade pasta.Overall, a great food experience, but I don think it would be a place I go back to based on price., I love their sister restaurant Marea in NYC so I was very excited to try out Morini!Came during the first week of opening. Initial observations are that they are working out service kinks but the food is fun and well prepared. Space is beautiful!Kinks: twice food and drink came to our table that was not ours. I have a nut allergy and had to constantly ask about whether or not food contained nuts. Also our waiter was not aware that almonds are nuts. One of our pasta dishes was too salty.Pluses: group is aware of kinks and we got a discount off our meal for trying the restaurant so soon after opening. Our waiter made great suggestions in how much food to order for our table of four. Seafood pasta with sea urchin was a hit (similar to Mareas). Crostini come out quick and all three we tried were fantastic: beets, steak, and squash with speck., Its great to have another great restaurant in the Navy Yard and I can see how this place will take off given my experience. Food wise, Osteria is excellent. They bring out complimentary rosemary foccacia which was quite tasty. I would have eaten more but glad they didnt bring a huge portion. For a starter I had the crostini with manzo beef crudo and it too was very good. Whomever is making their breads is doing it right. And for the main, I had the lasagna verde. Again, another great dish and I finished it all. You can taste the difference in handmade pasta and the ragu was very well made. If I had a downside, some might take the serving size to be small. While they do come on the small side, it is good to pair with a starter. It brings the bill up but I left full and am glad I tried other menu items. As to other aspects, the service is great. She was well versed in all aspects of the menu and was able to give suggestions of what to try. The atmosphere is upscale/modern that works great with the building that has great views of the Anacostia. They also have great music playing; no old Italian music that makes you want to leave anytime soon. This place can serve as both a restaurant and a new happy hour spot as another reviewer mentioned. Sounds like great advice to me. Lets hope the maintain the strong start on all levels., The views are beautiful, the food delicious and service impeccable. I did go opening night so the staff might have been more attentive than usual. The crostini was especially good. On the down side (and there isnt much) it was very difficult to find but definitely worth the effort., We snagged reservations here Wednesday night. For those not familiar with the neighborhood, it changed a lot since the stadium went up. I was surprised at the amount of foot traffic at 7pm; lots of folks walking home from work, walking the dog, jogging with strollers, taking the family to Nando for chicken. The place never felt deserted or isolated. Lots of nearby construction on office and condo developments, so there plenty of floodlights and street lighting. Parking was slim to nonexistent. There street parking on Tingey Street, but your best bet is either the Navy Yard Metro or the private automated lot on 3rd and Water Street. Morini is located in Yards Park in a big glass warehouse that gives you a great view of the Anacostia Riverwalk and the USS Barry. I can see them doing a lot of waterfront business in the warmer months. The interior is warehousey: high ceilings, exposed girders, lots of glass. At 7, the place was at about quarter capacity, so there wasn the usual deafening buzz. That will probably change on Saturday nights. There a long bar for your $9 wine pours and small plates. The chairs were bare and uncomfortable so we moved to a cushioned booth and were handed a cute little basket of light airy foccacia seasoned with sea salt. The menu is fairly broad with a selection of cured meats, italian cheeses, crostini, salads, and antipasto to choose for first course, followed by fresh in-house pastas and seafood/meat entrees, several of which are grilled over wood charcoal (you can peer in behind the window on the way to the restroom). I opted for:Speck (smoked prosciutto)Coppa (cured pork neck)Bresola (air dried beef)Lardo (prosciutto bianco)Mountain GorgonzolaThe bresola had a nice black peppery punch, but the best of the bunch was the lardo, shaved thin and served at room temperature, it was like a rich, porky butter for spreading on the grilled bread. If you like roasted bone marrow, youl like this. Since we already had a few beers at Bluejacket (highly recommend The Butcher dunkles dopplebock which is made with Red Apron malt smoked over apple, cherry, and hickory wood), we just opted for a bottle of Pellegrino, which was good since that speck will give you a powerful thirst. I don know whether it was the saltiness of the cured meat or that I used to more aggressively seasoned sauces (see the pepperoni sauce at Graffiato), but the flavor of the prosciutto & mortadella meatballs was a little too subtle for me. The pomodoro and shaved parmigiano didn seem to help any. The texture reminded me of ground veal, which I liked, but I didn get much out of this dish. The wife Agnolotti (taleggio and potato ravioli, short rib ragu), however, had a nice well-rounded beefy/cheesy flavor. My Porchetta (thick rind pork chop, pear puree, fennel & brussel sprout slaw, topped with cracklings) wasn like the usual thin sliced sandwich porchetta, but a thicker, fattier cousin. If youe a fan of swine, this one had a lot of flavor. I spotted three managers walking the floor and there was about a dozen staff working the ovens, so food moved efficiently and we didn go 15 minutes without someone checking on our water and drinks. About the worst I could say is that the background music was K Billy Super Sounds of the Seventies mashed-up with a K-Tel Monster Hits mix tape. Instead of Dean Martin or Mario Lanza or Pagliacci, we got Steve Miller Band and The Eagles and Creedence. I guess theye going for an aging boomer demographic, but if I wanted to eat Italian while listening to Can You See by the Marshall Tucker Band, I could do that at home in my underwear. Some folks have complained about the prices, but food of this quality served by people who know what theye doing on waterfront real estate doesn come cheap. Sure, there a 32oz bone in NY Strip for two for $80 for those folks who think fine dining is a slab of meat the size of a toilet seat, but the two of us got out of there stuffed to the gills for $120, which is pretty decent by downtown DC standards. Drinks will send that pricetag much higher, but you can still cobble together an assortment of shared dishes without getting stuck with a bill for the month rent. I looking forward to working my way through the menu., I recently dined here with a friend from out of town and was blown away by the quality of the food, the impeccable service, and the tasteful atmosphere. Bravo Osteria Morini DC team for a job well done for only being open a week. Special thanks go to our server Kaloni and her assistant Charlie(f), the talented (and rather dashing) sommelier Jochem, and manager Alex for making us feel welcome and at home. I/we will be back with other friends as soon as we can. Cheers!, Ive been here a couple times now. The first was for a date, and between the two of us we tried to get something from every section of he menu. It was all great, but I think the pasta was the most memorable. The second time was for lunch, and I got one of the sandwich and salad lunch specials. The (short rib) sandwich was very good, and so was the salad, which came with a delicious crostini on top. The service was attentive and friendly both times. Great addition to the Navy Yard., Tried Morini for the first time this past weekend with friends and had a fantastic experience! First off, the food is amazing. We started off with a sampling of crostinis, all delicious especially the beef crudo. Our server offered to bring more bread once we finished the initial serving, a nice gesture. We continued the meal with some pastas, great variety, the Cappeletti is an absolute must! On to the entrees. I had the duck breast which was cooked to perfection, very tender. The cherry glaze and farro that accompanied it really pulled the dish together. My friends ordered the cornish hen and swordfish, both of which were enjoyed as well. We finished out the meal with tiramisu, initially thinking we were too full for dessert, we managed to finish two servings!The space made the experience more enjoyable as well. We had a nice view out the window into the park and the noise level was energetic but I never found myself needing to raise my voice to speak during the meal. Our server was also very friendly and knowledgeable with menu recommendations. I will definitely be returning!, There is something about this place that just pulls me in again and again. My friends and I observed that adults eat here and I very much appreciate that. Ive been here about 4 times already and that is quite something considering how many spots open in DC on the regular. I felt like I needed a moment alone with the Felino Salame and with the Parmigiano Gelato. The pasta is pretty ridiculous, Ive had the Gramigna all 4 times Ie been there: pork sausage, tomato and cream. Are you kidding me?One of my visits was for my birthday and they made me feel like a Disney Princess..the chef came out to make small talk, that was pretty rad. The sommeliers (Jochem, Erich) were extremely helpful and the overall experience time and again was just flawless. Il make the hike to the Navy Yard whenever possible. Word., Wonderful place!! We had dinner here for my husbands birthday. The service was great and the food was equally good. There is a great wine selection as well. We would definitely go back., This is the only restaurant I am aware of that serves food native to the Romagna region of Italy, known in Italy as the food capital of the country. That alone says something. You pretty much cant go wrong with anything here, whether you get any of the cured meats, cheeses or freshly made pastas. All exquisite. My one complaint is that for the price, the portions are rather modest, smaller than those in Romagna even., Great food and service, we will definitely return! Only downsides: some tables are very close together and the wine/beer list was limited and expensive., This place is so very much needed in DC. What a fabulous addition to the neighborhood. It some of the best Italian food in the city. And even better, the space is gorgeous... big and airy... loads of glass and light overlooking a hidden gem of an area in Navy Yard just down a few blocks from Nationals ballpark. I afraid that when baseball season starts, this place will take off like a rocket and Il never get an easy reservation again!Ie eaten here twice for lunch in the last couple of months. I highly recommend their lunch specials that let you get a panini with the tortellini soup (tortellini in brodo) ($19) or one of their pastas with an appetizer or dessert ($25). I have tried the appetizer called Testa (crispy pig head terrine, farm egg, Meyer lemon). It not as scary as it sounds...but it is VERY rich. Definitely big tastes, so make sure youe sharing this with 1 or 2 more people. I have tried the following 3 pastas: Tagliatelle (thin ribbon pasta, ragu antica, parmigiano), Spaghetti (shrimp, arugula pesto, fennel, pine nuts) and Stracci (wide ribbon pasta, braised wild mushrooms, rosemary oil). All are slap your head delicious! You can watch them making the pasta in the open kitchen. Everything is fresh and flavorful. The sauces are rich but not over-done. Even the pesto is lighter than you expect... and buttery too. And with the homemade focaccia bread (some of the best Ie ever had -- even the flaked sea salt finish is perfect), you will soak everything up and cry when it over. Best pasta in the area, hands down!I also have tried the panini: Stracotto (short ribs, mushrooms, scamorza, horseradish). Just what you hope for -- tender large serving of beef on chewy bread and tasty horseradish sauce.You can go wrong! Make sure to get one of the over-the-top desserts... all are worthy of the finest restaurants. The pastry chefs really go all out! Ie had the pleasure of trying two of them. The Tortino al Cioccolato (warm chocolate cake, liquid ganache, espresso gelato) -- the cake itself is like a perfect dark chocolate brownie and then it filled with a pool of hot liquid ganache. This is not your chain restaurant lava cake! This is real decadence and ideal for the chocolate lover. The other one was the Torta di Limone (lemon tart, toasted meringue, orange marmalade, vanilla gelato) -- you get a generous slice of lemon tart that is similar to a proper key lime pie in texture (dense creamy yellow custard). It topped with a toasted meringue. The bottom crust is an amazing cookie! There more cookie crumbles under the handmade real vanilla gelato. And then there a garnish of bright candied orange marmalade (if they sold it in a jar, I buy it!)Seriously, I rarely get excited about DC restaurants. What a thrill! GO! Run... before the crowds find it! (one warning... it is still hard to find. You have to park in Lot L, then walk to this building marked with the 301 for Water St SE... walk AROUND the building to the water and there is this unbelievable gem of a restaurant in the back of the building!), This place is a great addition to the Navy Yard neighborhood. We were seated right at the front window, which will be a lovely view when it gets warmer out and stays light later. Our server was knowledgable and attentive without being annoying. We had the crostini, a salad, and then we each had a pasta dish. Everything was delicious, but the meal was $150 for two people which was just a bit much for small plates. Honestly Id have been happier with a $20 meal at Pasta Mia, but for me, Italian doesnt have to be fancy., The best thing about this restaurant is the building in which it located. The building is a historic warehouse that has been beautifully and sleekly renovated. Unfortunately, the design of the restaurant interior is disappointingly old-fashioned, and maybe even downright. . . suburban. (The restaurant interior also gets demerits from me for having a large television. Why do so many restaurants have tv nowadays? If you want to watch TV, stay at home!)Then there the food, which was mediocre in the true sense if the word. My husband and I split an endive salad to start, and it was the best part of the meal -- flavorful and unusual without trying too hard. Then we got two pastas to share for the main course. I a vegetarian, so we ordered the casarecce, which is normally vegetarian anyway, plus another, ravioli-like pasta (can remember the name) minus the speck that normally comes with it. The former tasted a bit out-of-the-can, while the latter was swimming in a butter sauce that tasted a little dishwater-ish. The texture in both cases was okay, but neither dish was worth the price ($17 and $20 respectively). We also split a dessert, which consisted of a few pieces of fairly tasty toffee, some pretty good olive oil cake, and some butterscotch mousse that was awfully close to Jell-o pudding. We did like our waitress -- I think her name was Shauna -- who was cheerful and attentive. We wanted to like this place, largely because we are rooting for the nascent Yards neighborhood. We just wish the restaurant were better designed and the food were a LOT better., Great place that I love having in the neighborhood. Very good food, a good mix of familiar (but very well done) dishes and things Ie never had before (like the parmesean gelato that we now order at each visit).Cocktails are very good as well, I am sad they took the merry mertillio off the menu (assume this was a seasonal rotation).Be prepared to open your wallet a bit, with apps, drinks, entree/pasta, and a shared dessert came to $130. Not exorbitant for the quality, just a heads up to save this place for when youe looking to treat yourself.Desserts are delicious and beautifully presented.The only thing that is preventing me from giving this 5 stars is the atmosphere, the space is gorgeous, but the tables are packed too close together, we were bumped several times by (very friendly and knowledgable!) staff. It also makes the dining room louder than the food/price point suggest it would be., NYC sister restaurant that does nothing but add a great Italian option to the DC dining scene!I have had trying a Michael White restaurant on my dining bucket list for quite some time. He is lauded as a pasta magician and the pasta here demonstrates this to be true...5 Star pasta!We started with the Zucca Crostini, excellent sweet and savory winter squash on crostini, that honestly could have been a little crispier. It still made for an acceptable vehicle for getting down the tasty spread.We moved on to the Ricotta Gnocci, and the Stracci (wide ribbon pasta, braised wild mushrooms, rosemary oil). This was plain and simply perfect pasta in both cases. Delicate, flavorful and sauced just right. We followed that with the Branzino. We kind of shared everything small plate style. The Branzino was cooked with fennel and charred lemon. It was a great dish, both slightly sweet from the fennel and citrusy from the lemon and cooked just right!For dessert we tried the Budino, (butterscotch crema, olive oil cake, dark chocolate toffee crunch, pine nuts--pasted from the website) and the Lemon Torta...Both 5 Stars!Im deducting a star for the wine pours, which were shallow to say the least and the slightly chewy and room temp crostini. Service was friendly and on point otherwise. Its a nice addition to DC, and Im even more excited to try some of his other places in NYC now!, Had a wonderful meal tonight. Started with smoked trout crostini, winter squash zucchini, and roasted beets ricotta salata. Tthe trout and squash were superb. For entrees, had the mixed grill, Grigliata Mista, lamb chops, skirt steak, sausage, and pancetta. This was marvelous, perfectly done, and full of flavor. Table mates had the Anatra duck breast, which was tender and perfectly done, topped with delicious am arena cherries. The Brodetto, mussels, clams, scallops, and shrimp, with basil, served in pretty bowl, was described as delicious. But the deserts were worth coming back. We shared a peanut butter carmellata, a most delicious dark chocolate mouse, with am arena cherries, pistachio crema, and a wonderful chocolate pistachio gelato. Again worth coming back for again and again! We also shared a limone torte, with vanilla gelato, and the risotto, a vanilla rice pudding, that was like none I have ever had. My favorite is still the chocolate mousse, but we agreed to return for others in the future. And being right on the waterfront, this is the perfect blend of ambience and sumptuous food. A good value in my humble opinion. Can be a little noisy, as the windows which provide aerfect view, also reflect the sound, but we were able to have a nice conversation, even on a busy Saturday night!, Would have given five stars but our waitress was horrible, the 4 star rating is because of the food.....its delicious enough to overlook the the sometimes awkward treatment./service we received from the waitress. I will chalk it up to she was having a bad day as everyone else (water guy, bread person, person who brought the wine)were very pleasant. Had it not been for the fact that every dish we ordered was a home run, the review would be allot different. Once the weather kicks into high gear and people realize how much money and work has been done to the former hood(miss tracks and buzz)on the waterfront, this place will be the hot new waterfront dinning venue in DC. Go now, deal with the the service(they will find their grove and service will improve)before you cant get a reservation and people start heading to this part of town. The crostini spreads were killer, all pastas fresh and delicious, i had the duck which was perfectly cooked, and the dessert was a perfect finish to an awesome meal. Italian wine lovers will also love the option/variety that is offered., Very solid addition to the neighborhood. We tried all of the appetizers and it was a wonderful cheese extravaganza! Terrific bar selection and wonderful decor with a nice view., Excellent food and service, once you get past the 45 minutes wait (though we had a reservation). I hope they get better at managing table rotations because it would be unfortunate reason to not try this place.My friends and I had a range of dishes and loved them all - the lamb chops (agnello), pork chops (braciola), and pasta with mushrooms (stracci), to name a few. The lamb was cooked perfectly, tender, and flavorful. The pasta was so soft and the pork chop was also excellent. The desserts were also delicious - the butterscotch cr38me pie and tiramisu. Id love to come back if they can fix the issue with the extremely long wait., Location is between the DC Navy Yard and Nationals Park, right on the Anacostia River. Dinner time was very crowded, but very nice place. High ceilings, nice overall ambiance. A little loud in some areas, but our table was near the kitchen, which is kind of an open kitchen, and wasn so noisy. Nice bar. Wait was reasonable. Service was attentive w/o being annoying -- very good, maybe excellent. Waitress when asked made suggestions that were excellent. Or maybe that was just the food itself! Gave the sommelier a tough description of a compromise red we wanted, to satisfy the 4 of us, and he suggested a reasonably priced bottle that was pretty much what I described, and was good. Appetizers were wonderful: we had a Crostini with 3 smears, and all 3 were excellent, to where we couldn decide which was best. Entrees were excellent, too. My duck was unusually excellent: flavorful, cooked right, great sauce and accompaniments. Our swordfish special was excellent, and that not just the fish, but also, again the sauce and accompaniments. Kids(both 20+) pastas were terrific too: a pasta with sea urchin and a red sauce, a spaghetti with basil pesto and shrimp. The gelatis for desert and the chocolate mousse also were great. Overall a memorable meal. The price was on the high side, but not super high, and for dining like this it was worth it. Go for it!, Really wonderful. Arriving on a cold winter night after yet another snowstorm, Osteria Morini was inviting and comforting in all respects. The room felt homey and the open kitchen provided a soothing touch. Although there were only two of us, we ordered as if we were expecting guests because we wanted to sample so many items on the menu. Glad we did since they were all great. We started with a delicious variety of perfectly cured meats and the arugula pear salad, moved on to the most savory pasta (stracci) with wild mushrooms as a shared mid-course and then devoured the short ribs and the branzino. Not to be outdone by the Executive Chef, the Pastry Chef deserves 5 stars. His peanut butter caramellatta is the most phenomenal combination of chocolate and peanut butter. And to stop just short of total indulgence, we also ordered a couple of sorbets which tasted amazing. Cant wait to go back!, The fiance and I drove in from the burbs to meet another couple for dinner. We parked in the lot right next to the building but I have a suspicion parking in the future wont be as easy as this area is getting built up fast with cool looking restaurants. The entry to get to Osteria Morini is on the water side, so to get in youll have to walk around the building from the street to get to the front door. We were lucky enough to have a table next to the windows and were able to take in the fantastic view. The inside is clean, although a little cramped with tables. The noise level was a little loud with the high ceilings, but it wasnt too bad. I had the pinot grigio which was crisp and tart, which I enjoyed as pinot grigio can be a bit too sweet for me sometimes. We had complimentary rosemary bread, but werent offered any olive oil or butter with it. The bread was good regardless, but it would have been better with said oil or butter. I had the wide ribbon pasta with mushrooms and thought it was just the right portion. It wasnt too much and I was actually able to finish the plate, which I normally dont. The rest of the table ordered lasagna, short ribs and the seafood soup. Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was fantastic. Meals all came out at the same time, just a few check-ins from our waitress so it wasnt obnoxious, but enough that we felt taken care of. Overall, this was a great restaurant with great service. If I lived closer, I would make this a regular stop!, We came here tonight and they were slammed from post opening day guests. We had a reservation and were seated right away. We had the scallop app and three dips (smoked trout, Parmesan gelato and beet pur39e) the parm gelato and smoked trout dip were AMAZING. All of the pasta dishes were great. Dessert is a must get!, My experience there was definitely not the best. Service was not good, they were no paying attention to us, such bringing more bread, parmiggiano, coke, when we asked.Pastas are good, but not extraordinary, my spaghettis were definitely missing something...The only good thing about this restaurant is the location + when summer will finally hit DC they have a very nice outside dining close to the Potomac., Checked out their newly available brunch menu today. We were seated outside with gorgeous waterfront views and very attentive waitstaff. I started with one of their five bloody Marys--just enough heat with stuffed olives. Our group of five then got the mimosas--for $36, we got a bottle of prosecco and two choices of unlimited fresh squeezed juice--we chose blood orange and grapefruit. Such bright flavors. Half of the group ordered the ricotta pancakes with orange marmalade and maple marscapone. My friends raved about them. I got the poached eggs with a spicy hollandaise and roasted fingerling potatoes. The dish is supposed to come with shrimp, but Im not a big seafood fan, so they let me substitute with pork belly. Strips of sun-dried tomatoes and roasted garlic complete the dish for a great rich flavor.At the end of the meal the pastry chef came out to say hello and told is we made a big mistake--not ordering the pastry basket! So he brought us one complementary. The pastries--both sweet and savory--were buttery and light. Overall, excellent food, great service, and gorgeous waterfront views. Highly recommend., As others have mentioned, Osteria Morini is located along the gentrifying Navy Yard/ Anacostia River waterfront and makes for a great date night. Parking is difficult. This Italian restaurant easily rivals Casa Luca (Fabio Trabocchis family style restaurant), and I would recommend taking a family style approach with Osteria Morini as well. There are a lot of really fantastic things on the menu that you have to try (cured meats and cheese? always a good place to start in my opinion). Additionally, the capesante is arguably one of the best appetizers I have ever had. It is admirably well-balanced with the perfect amount of fat (lardons), sweetness (scallops), and freshness (italian parsley). The lentils add a great textural component to the dish as well as acting as a conduit to recombine and reintroduce you to all the individual components in the capesante. Delicious.The pastas are no slouch either, but honestly, not the mind blowing experience I was hoping for from a Michael White establishment. Marea (his Columbus Circle NYC flagship) is a place you hear so much about - revered pastas with plenty of minds blown. That isnt to say that these pastas arent tasty in their own right or that they are poorly executed. The combinations of ingredients and flavor profiles arent unique and seem to cater more to traditional flavors as opposed to the noveau, boundary shattering pasta that occurs at Marea. The desserts deserve a nod of the head as well. There is definitely something to engage everyones sweet tooth. My sweet tooth is really not that into sweet, but I was able to find a well constructed and balanced dessert in the risa. I enjoyed the sweetness of both the rice pudding and the sorbetto and the almond crumble to mellow out some of the richness and sweetness from the rice pudding. Again, delicious!, This place is the modicum of great customer service, consistently incredible food, in a refined but relaxed atmosphere. What can I say? When you find a good thing, tell the world., sooo we started off great! the buildout is nice, trendy without overdoing it - noise level is on the loud side but not unbearable -patio looks lovely (was too chilly) - cocktails were great :-) violette ftw -alll the crostini a were fun - even the ones I didnt really care for were interesting and innovative :-) the service was good (not great) the charcuterie was a delight ... but the entrees / pasta dishes were considerably less exciting :-( Maybe we didnt order the right things? but both dishes were kinda meh ... now dont get me wrong the pasta itself was fresh fresh fresh and wonderful -- they just ran into trouble with the sauces that didnt seem to live up to the rest of the experience. kinda felt like I ordered $20 worth of butter noodles the sauce felt like it was for kids :-(my companion had the tagliatelle and it was fine but again not very exciting -- finishing on a sad note left us feeling like we had prob overpaid and didnt really see it being a regular spot. Is it a nice addition to the neighborhood? DEFIANTLY! would I go back? prob not for dinner maybe for cocktails and starters? I feel like the server could have really made a dif in our experience, we asked a lot of questions trying to order things we would love but the guidance / enthusiasm level coulda been kicked up a notch..(basically just told us to check yelp on our phone lol) I do think I would like to try lunch - after checking yelp I think it looked pretty interesting:-) xoxo, Have yet to try lunch/dinner, but brunch and desserts are out of this world. Get the pastry basket at brunch and the Oyster Bloody Mary. Outdoor patio with a view of the river/park adds a fantastic ambiance., If I was rating just the food, it would be as many stars as I could possibly give. Seriously delicious. We started out with a meat and cheese platter (we chose proscuitto, fegatini, and parmigiano), and each got a pasta: I got the ricotta gnocchi and my husband got the capeletti. The sauces on each were to die for; I wanted to lick my plate when I was done. We finished with the riso for dessert; more deliciousness. The service was seriously lacking, though. We were seated right away but it took about 20 minutes before we could even place our drink orders. My husband asked for iced tea; I stuck with water. It was about another 10 minutes before he got his iced tea. Our server came back and explained the menu to us, and then ran off, so we had to wait for another 15 minutes before placing the order. Based on how little we had seen our server, we ordered everything at once. Because I am a type 1 diabetic, I gave my shot of insulin to prepare for the meal. Although our server told us that bread would be out shortly, we received no bread for about another 25 minutes, and it came out nearly at the same time we received our meats/cheese. The timing of giving insulin is extremely important for a diabetic, as it should be given 15-20 minutes before eating. I gave my shot with the expectation that I would at least have bread to keep my sugars elevated, and that we would have had our meals in front of us so the timing would be right. It was frustrating and stressful to watch my sugars drop while we waited for our courses. Throughout this time, we saw our server walking around once or twice, but she never stopped by to check on us during our appetizer course. My husband wanted a refill on his iced tea, and we finally had to flag her down to ask. (Having been in the service industry myself, it frustrates me to have to ask for refills.)After we had finished our appetizer, another wait for our main course was about 25 minutes. At this point, I was out of water and no one stopped by to refill. Our server also never checked on us during our meal to be sure everything was going okay. We also had ordered a side of polenta, which we never received. It was again frustrating to eat a meal without any water, and no sign of anyone I could ask for a refill: everyone was either out of our reach or carrying trays of food/plates. After our plates were cleared, the server came back and we ordered our riso and the check, which both got to us quickly. I hope service gets better. For now, though, if I can, I would stick to ordering food to go. The restaurant wasnt packed, and we should not have had a two-hour dinner. At the very least, it would have been nice to see our server more than a few times, and we would have appreciated someone stopping by to make sure everything was going well., Osteria Morini is an amazing addition to the Italian restaurants in DC. I have been to Marea in NYC and was excited to try Osteria Morini. Chef Michael White never disappoints. The polpettine and cotechino were stellar, from the appetizers. The cappeletti and agnolottie, from the pasta dishes, were amazing too! Next, the vitello, or veal with pancetta cream, and the agnello, or lamb chops, were fantastic! Finally, the desserts were out of this world ! Highly recommend checking this place out if you want great Italian in DC., My husband and I came here for brunch today. After reading the reviews, Id say theyre about on point. The food is good, but the service is just really really terrible! We had a reservation, and were seated upon checking in. We waited about 15 minutes before the hostess came and asked us if we needed anything?! Um yes, obviously!! She poured our waters, and asked us if wed spoken with our server yet. Really? Clearly no, since we had no waters! A few minutes later, someone brought us two half full glasses of prosecco, on the house, for our wait. This person asked us if wed spoken to our server also, and again we said no... I guess about 10 minutes later, our waiter finally showed up. It was so weird!! He just stood there and said: What can I get for you? I mean REALLY? Am I at McDonalds? There was no: Hi, my name is X, can I get you started with some drinks or appetizers? Etc. Nothing. I thought that maybe he wasnt our actual server, and was just doing someone else a favor, but nope - he was there for the entire meal. We went ahead and ordered, and we never saw him again until he brought us our food. Someone else came a few minutes later with some bread - which was pretty good. We seriously didnt see Mr. Personality until we were just about done with our meals. I had the ricotta pancakes with a side of grilled bread. The pancakes were delicious - super rich and fluffy. They had an orange and mascarpone topping that was just the right amount of sweet and savory. The grilled bread was just as yummy - grilled to perfection, nice and crunchy, and it came with raspberry jam and mascarpone cheese to spread on top. My husband ordered the stracci, which he said was OK. Its really a shame, because Navy Yard is such a cool neighborhood. We wont be back - there are too many other places in DC with equal or better food, and stellar service., Id been wanting to eat here every since they opened! I think its a great addition to the waterfront. I loved siting outside on a warm evening. However they dont have candles on the table so we were eating in complete darkness and couldnt even see our menus. I had the Stracci with wild mushrooms which was absolutely delicious and came already with shredded parm on it. However for $17 it was a very small portion. This restaurant does not serve free table bread. So for these three issues I had to take a star off., Shows signs of greatness but currently has many flaws. Service wasnt terrible but definitely below average. Bread and dips were good but pastas were strange and heavy. The chocolate caramel dessert wasnt hot enough and not that good. Then the bill came and there was no doubt that the amount well exceeded the pleasure we had from dining here. I couldnt recommend this place thats for sure., If you can make the trek to Navy Yard, this place is well worth it. The poached egg with shrimp and grits was divine. Fresh, juicy shrimps cooked just rights covered with over easy eggs - cant beat that. The ricotta pancakes were some of the best that I have had. The porchetta panino was terrific though it was the weakest of the three dishes, but the bar was pretty high. The service was very attentive and I was surprised how quiet it was compared to Aqua 301 next door. Maybe folks prefers to start of the day with Margaritas instead?, Fantastic food, but only 70% of what we ate was AMazing. Lamb chops, arugala salad (rucola), pipette, and lemon torta was A+. Beet crostini was eh. Peanut butter desset was good. Need to go back!!, I think its more like a 3.5.Reasons its a 3.5/4: -the pasta. the actual pasta itself is delicious and clearly of high quality. I had the stracci and the ribbons were out of this world. -the extensive wine list. its actually overwhelming!-the molten lava cake dessert with espresso gelato. YUM-the ambiance is really niceReasons its a 3:-the prices are just slightly higher than they should be-the service was not great. Our waitress was clearly pressuring us to order more food and more expensive food. It was really awkward and uncomfortable.We will probably go back here at some point, but will not be rushing back. I think Casa Luca is better! And certainly better service., nice outdoor seating. waiter was very friendly. staff was accomodating. sun began beaming and they moved our table a lil to adjust for a guest. a little pricey but great views and not too congrested with people. after you eat you can take a walk on the pier or sit on the grass., I stopped by Osteria Morini post Nationals Game. Ive never been down to the Navy Yard (I think thats this area), and its really pretty since its on the water and a lot of people are hanging out with dogs/strollers/and the like.Unfortunately, the restaurant needs to seriously work with its FOH staff. The food exceeded my expectations but the service left a lot to be desired. We were first turned away from outdoor seating since we had no reservation. Understandable, if the patio was packed. It was not. We waited for one of the four seat yourself tables on the patio and I was annoyed to notice when we were seated that most of the tables on the reserved side were empty and then remained empty for the duration of our stay.Our server was friendly, but kind of forgot we existed and the sommelier was short and really didnt seem to know his wines. Also, the wine is poured into stemless wine glasses here rather than regular wine glasses (with stem). I know its a fad and trend, but it kind of peeves me out, perhaps Im being fussy, but I swear, my wine tastes a lot better in a real wine glass. The food and nice outdoor patio were the redeeming factors which brought the rating back to three stars. I thought the food was really great! The Stracci was delicious. The pasta was perfect, the mushrooms were tasty, and it was an all around pleasing dish. The duck was awesome, and thank god, for a change, not in an apple cider vinegar type sauce/marinade. It was straight forward with a nice fattiness, crispy skin, and was well seasoned as opposed to all sauced up.  Felt it was a shame the food, which was excellent, had to be accompanied by poor service. The restaurant has a lot of potential if they could work on some of the details., I was just here with some friends on Sunday for a brunch. All i can say is that the Yards are truly becoming a place to be. The food here was amazing, pastries and desserts one of the best and service truly remarkable. I look forward to returning to a restaurant that truly gets it from start toi finish!, Food was delicious (my friend and I split the short ribs, cappelletti and asparagus- as somebody who used to live in the Emilia Romagna region, Im pretty picky with Italian food!), as was my drink, but service left something to be desired. Our waitress seemed flustered and unhappy with her life and overall not as polished as I think a server should be at a nice restaurant. Also while we were waiting for our table, the bartender started arguing with us and acting defensive when we mentioned to another patron who was trying to decide on a drink (and specifically looking for something that wasnt sweet), that my friends drink, while good, was pretty sweet. Both us and the other patron felt a bit uncomfortable and awkward that she was arguing with us when we werent trying to be rude, just describing that the drink was on the sweeter side!The space is lovely, and a good excuse for a trip to the Navy Yard area. Ill give Osteria Morini a pass that its still somewhat new and working out its kinks, but for an experienced restauranteur like Michael White, I would think he would have higher standards for service 6 months after opening. Also, they need to buy candles or add lights on the patio so you can read the menus at night without using cell phones as flashlights!, Terrible service. Waitress was bothered to have to answer questions and menu is not very easy to navigate even if u eat out frequently. They just opened terrible first and last impression., You know youe in for a ride when you ask for water and the server responds, Sparkling, flat, or tap? Despite the broad menu, they were out of my top two choices - the porcetta and brodetto (due to late deliveries - so you can be assured their seafood is fresh!) - so I ended up ordering a $20 bowl of pasta. I should have checked out the other tables first, because when the bowl appeared, it contained about a half-box worth of Kraft Mac-nCheese (by volume), but what an experience it was - macaroni al dente, lathered in an embrace of carbonara sauce, pork sausage and pecorino cheese. Four stars for the food quality and presentation, three stars for the volume (I could have ordered a sandwich, salad, and chips for the same price), and four stars for excellent service - our attentive server refreshed our focaccia basket twice (probably in acknowledgement of the size of the pasta portions) and my Diet Coke three times. The prices make it prohibitive as a regular lunch hangout, but the unexplored items on the menu invite future special-occasion visits - now if I could only persuade more of my co-workers to hold their retirement luncheons there . . . ., I LOVE this place. I havent been to too many italian places in DC, but the few I have gone to do not even come close to OM. Staff is friendly, food is amazing and the wine (albeit a little expensive) is excellent. Lasagna is to die for, anything beef- MUST ORDER, and their bread/ pastas are just amazing. They could use a little work with service since this place is on the pricey side, but overall a great experience and would def recommend., I love Italian cuisine and have a particular weakness for fresh, hand-made pasta, so imagine my joy when I found out about this restaurant! My visit however didnt quite live up to the expectation. Appetizer - We ordered the scallop with lentils. The $15 dish comes with 3 medium-sized sea scallops... yes I repeat, THREE. The flavor profile was good, but they were neither the best nor the biggest/freshest scallops Ive had. My husband and I both chuckled a bit upon seeing how small it was. (I later saw a Yelp picture of this same dish showing 5 scallops and felt cheated... maybe they reduced the portion size) Pasta - The tagliatelle and the squid-ink pasta were both good. Delicious. Pasta portion is typical of what Ive seen in Europe, so no surprise there. I think its sufficient, and you can always fill up with the complimentary foccacia. However, the bowl of squid ink pasta with mussels comes with 3 mussels. Yes, three. (NOTE: mussel is the only protein in this dish as there is not another seafood) While the pasta tastes good, Ive had pasta that are equally tasty elsewhere and have much better value, i.e. seafood that come with more than 3 mussels!. Tiramisu - this was the highlight of our meal! Ive had a gastronomic tiramisu experience at a local restaurant in Florence, Italy, and this tiramisu comes pretty close. The mascarpone cream is done very, very well. Service - Despite several negative reviews about the service, we had a really friendly waitress. The service is a little slower than Id like but our waitress was helping multiple tables, so I understand sometimes things take longer. Overall - food is good, but not spectacular enough to justify the lack of value or having to trek all the way to the Navy yard. Unfortunately would not go out of my way to come eat here again., I go to a lot of Nats games and wanted to eat something other than baseball junk food so I decided to come to Morini. I was surprised at the beautiful location on the waterfront. The interior was bright, new and clean and we were greeted in a friendly manner. The descriptions on the menu were a bit confusing but the server gladly assisted us and recommended the Gramigna carbonara pasta. The portion didnt look worth the $20 price but it was absolutely delicious and surprisingly filling and Im a big guy. Im sure the prices have to do with the sky high DC real estate rate theyre paying. But overall it was a pleasant experience and Ill be back. I would give 5 stars but had to take 1 off for the portion size for $20.
52|ottoman-taverna-washington|Its the first week they are open! Service is great and this place is really beautiful! Nice looking bar, open kitchen, and pretty Turkish decor. I forgot to take picture for the appetizer the chef gave us as gifts, but it was really good.Their bread is warm and really different, served with a red pepper paste and butter.There octopus fattouch salad is BIG. If you like olive taste and seafood it will be a good choice. I would prefer it with more Vinegar flavor, but I think its personal preference only and not what authentic Turkish food should taste like.The lamb chop is flavorful and saucy. I regretted not saving some bread for it. It taste good and the serving is really generous (for around $24 I think).The last is the drinks. Good and different! I had The darker on in the pictures called Sultan Swing (Im not sure), fruity and nice., I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant! We went with some friends for my sister bday, and the food was to die for! I live nearby so when I heard the buzz about a new Turkish Restaurant, I knew I had to go opening night! The food was so good, and to waiter was named Isa, he was so kind and informative about the food, which helped me choose the Adana Kabab which was amazing. Already have a reservation for next week!, Tried to come here for dinner at 5:15 on a Friday. The restaurant was completely empty, not a single table was occupied. We were denied a table because the server told us the restaurant was full. Every single time slot on opentable was available to make a reservation. Very unwelcoming and odd experience for a restaurant that clearly isnt full and just opened. We awkwardly left as the server stared at us. Should be trying harder to make customers enjoy, or get to have an experience., Must try Lahmacun, minched beef&lamb with chopped veggies and spices. They even import the flour from Turkey.Also for dessert house prepared Kunefe was an excellent choice for us.I was not a fan of Manti, maybe thats because we were full but overall experience was simply great., Dined here with friends for happy hour on a Friday night (around 6:30 pm). The food and service were great! We tried everything on the happy hour menu and our favorites were the eggplant, sausage, and roasted red pepper dishes. The complimentary pita flatbread was also delicious. We also got a tasty amuse-bouche at the bar! The restaurant was beautiful and was buzzing by time we left around 8:00 pm., This is a great addition to the neighborhood. We went there last night had the Adana Kebab and the meze platter. Service also was excellent very attentive. In desserts we tried the Kunefe which is to die for. We will be going back., Its tough to get food, service etc just right when you first open, but this Turkish cuisine restaurant was incredible for a restaurant only open 4 days! Our dining partner ordered for the table so I cant tell all that came....just that it was all great...and plentiful.We started with flatbread and the sampler shown. That would have been dinner enough....but the lamb, the beef, eggplant and all that followed were equally delicious. Even the Turkish wines we tried - red and white - were good. Service was also excellant.All in all, get there before the lines start forming and you cant get a reservation. Ottoman Taverna strikes exactly the right tone and is a great add to this changing neighborhood., First time at this brand new restaurant in my neighborhood. Decor is classy, with a nice balance of traditional and modern. But it needs softer edges -- when the place is full, it hard to hear people in a conversation at the table. Service aspires to be high-end, but it clunky. Attempts at jokes fell flat. Interactions were abrupt not smooth. And when I asked one food runner if an item had nuts, the answer was no, it vegetarian. The flavors were rich and spicy. Love the sesame bread. Hummus was a kicked-up version of traditional. Cauliflower stew with chick peas was a filling veggie option. But everything was priced 50% too high ($14 cocktails, really?). And speaking of cocktails, they didn even have the one I ordered -- at the start of dinner service on a Saturday. Il probably give it another try, but it had work to do before the prices will be a good value., Beautiful modern and well-lit interior with an open kitchen; tables are a bit cramped together and noise levels are high on a Saturday night but our group of 8 managed well.The mezzes were well done but a bit smaller and pricier vs. Lebanese Taverna (although comparable in quality/value to Zaytinya). I recommend the garlic hummus, falafel, and haydari, though the dolmasi (grape leaves) were average at best. The bread that accompanied the dishes were a bit too hard for dipping...regular pita would work better.Re: entrees, portions were regularly sized - the iskender kebap had a good amount of meat for one person (I shared mine) although the toasted pita base was a bit soggy (pita crisps might work better?). However, a common complaint at the table was the meats under-seasoning (more salt/pepper).Desserts were all excellent and extremely rich - the kunefe should definitely be shared with another person to avoid contracting diabetes.Service was a bit slow and erratic (we had to flag down a server a few times and they seemed a bit understaffed), but also was very warm and friendly - but theyve only opened a week ago, so this will likely improve over time. But hey, just imagine youre dining out in Turkey and youll be alright!Minus 1 star for not having actual Ottoman seating (ha! ha!), This restaurant stands out with unique decor and top notch design. The walls are dressed in images of famous Hagia Sofia Cathedral in Istanbul, and the separate dinning rooms carry their own names from old Istanbul neighborhoods. The Onyx bar brings elegance to your dinning out and a glitter to your cocktail. Cocktails are named by Turkish tradition and prepared with ethnical influence. Menu is reach with varieties of delicious Turkish cuisine, and the wine list makes a perfect marriage to the food offerings. One must start their meal in a traditional Turkish way, a glass of Raki, sited in a handcrafted copper dish that serves as a cooling agent and famed Choban Salad, witch is a blend of chopped tomato and cucumber in olive oil and feta cheese. Ottoman Taverna offers halal meat, starting from the mouthwatering Duner kebabs, to the smoky Adana grilled kebab and succulent and luscious lamb chops. One must devour the meal with Turkish pistachio filled baklava and aromatic fincan of frothy Turkish Coffee. This restaurant presents a remarkable encounter with a culture unabating exotic and mysterious to many people., Group of us went to this new neighbour lacation yesterday. It was a great experiance. We had tbe meze plater to share as a main course , we tried the iskendet kebab, doner, brazino and manti. Everyone enjoyed it.service was very attentive and the waiter was very knowladgable.in dederts we tried the kunefe and the rice pudding also were very good.i strongly recommand it, we will be back, Great Food , awesome service , friendly staff great ambiance.  DC really needed a place like thisWe will be back, Fantastic dinner last night for my birthday. Restaurant is beautifully decorated. Cool bar area and open kitchen area. No detail left untouched. Service was impeccable. Everyone we interacted with (hostess, manager and waiters) made sure we had everything we could possibly need. Very attentive but not overbearing. Food was delicious. Meze platter, lahmacun, braised lamb shank, manti, iskander all beautifully done. Traditional Turkish desserts of baklava, kunefe and rice pudding were excellent.Great place to enjoy a tasty meal with friends. Will definitely be back., Not only is this restaurant stunning, but its food is outstanding. Ive been twice since it opened about a week ago. The lamb chops are the most phenomenal item on the menu (the lamb shanks are great too, and fall off the bone, but theres something about the lamb chops that are to die for!). The eggplant puree was unlike anything Id ever had before. Id never seen eggplant served that way and it was delicious! The starter plate with the sampler of different spreads is a great way to get familiar with Turkish food. The flatbread was soft and warm and provided an amazing base for these spreads. My personal favorites were the hummus and the white feta cheese-like sauce. For desserts, the pistachio and cheese cake was good but the Baklava was out of this world. I recommend it highly! Definitely try a cocktail while youre there, theres a wide array and they are beautiful and also tasty!, I was pleasantly surprised...no blown away, by the authenticity of this Turkish Restaurant. I have traveled to Istanbul, Turkey and have dined in the best restaurants there. If I were blindfolded, I would swear I were back there. The signature dishes were made to perfection. Delicious food, attentive staff, beautifully decorated, romantic original music, and deviously good drinks. Looking forward to my next visit., You can find good d39cor or good food in many places but it is hard to find all of them in one place. This place is not only beautiful but also great food. Very inviting bar area to socialize and enjoy the incredible cocktails they prepare. Open kitchen with copper work looks very impressive. We were 4 of us and shared 4-5 appetizers and than another 4 entrees. Wine and beer was part of our meal and still very affordable! This is a must !, The meal was great, I have nothing bad to say about the quality, I just think its a little pricey for this type of food. Yes, its upscale, but hummus and doner kebab dont have to be as expensive as theyre charging. Other than that, it was great., I went to Ottoman Taverna a few days go, and was more than pleasantly surprised. The food is just AMAZING (my congratulations to the chef), the service was top notch and the cocktail selection is something new and exciting (to be honest, my review might be influenced by the cocktails, they were so good). At the end I was nicely surprised with the check, the place offers much more than the prices would suggest. The whole place is really classy, and even though I dont give five stars that often, this place definitely has deserve it. It is a welcomed addition to DC restaurant scene., All I can say is WOW - everything was superb! The drinks, main dishes, and atmosphere left me pleasantly surprised. Again, the drinks! I have tried a few but each one was amazing. The decor is beautiful and classy. Noise level is good for any type of gathering- romantic, group, happy hr, etc. This will be my regular from now on! Ottoman Taverna has won me over., This new restaurant is the best choice for Turkish cuisine. It has great appetizers and mezes, but I personally liked the kebaps and iskender mostly.As dessert I preferred k3cnefe, and my friend had baklava. Both were fantastic.I really recommend this new restaurant!, Went for lunch on a Thursday. I had the falafel sandwich and my boyfriend had the doner sandwich. Both were delicious - especially the unique poppy seed pita and fresh veggies inside - and well-priced for a higher end lunch spot. We sat outside at a nice shady table and the service was exceptional. Will definitely return!, I am not too familiar with Turkish cuisine, but I liked some of our experience, and was let down by other parts of it. I ordered a cocktail that tasted like it didnt have any alcohol in it, and may have been a total of 1 oz of liquid to start. I had the doner kabob and my wife had a chicken and rice dish. Both of our meats were not prepared as well as they should have been for a 20 dollar plate. Both my lamb and her chicken were dry and overcooked, although they were seasoned well. Our server was great and very knowledgable. 20 dollars for a bad kabob gave me flashbacks to late drunken nights in England, except they only cost 6 euros!Despite this, the bread was great, as was the appetizer plate of sauces and hummus for dipping. All in all, its ok, but 21 bucks could have gotten me a much better main at any nearby establishment., A few friends and I came here the other night to try it out after seeing the place packed the night before. My one friend is moving to Turkey in the fall and we thought it would be a great/festive way to celebrate.The atmosphere/interior are lovely, modern/sophisticated decor inside and a casual relaxed atmosphere al fresco if you want to enjoy the warm DC summers. Service was very good and the staff was very friendly. For only being open 2 weeks they did a very good job. The food was great! We started with wine (of course) and some amuse bouche along with warm pita bread, oil, and harrisa. Two of my friends ordered variations of kabobs, my other friend had the zucchini fritters, falafel, and a shepherds salad. We shared a little bit of each others and all were wonderful! I ordered the greek salad and asked if they could put some sort of meat on it and I was told they would not do it even after I offered to pay extra. Even with the lack of protein the salad was amazing, but I dont like being told I cannot modify something. I also ordered the Lahmacun flatbread and shared with the table, it was very tasty! After the entrees were devoured and another bottle of wine consumed we decided we couldnt pass up on dinner. We got the baklava and suzme yogurt and ball with turkish coffee. All were amazing and we left happy.Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends and will be back. The only faux pas was that I couldnt add chicken to my greek salad, which really doesnt seem like a ridiculous request., Perhaps DC and Turkish cuisine was not a match made in heaven, after all. For years now I have been on this soul-searching expedition for delicious Turkish food of my childhood, but I think it is time I give up. I was skeptical before my very first visit here, and my gut feeling proved to be right. I gave it one other chance, but it was all the same.The nice decor, the friendly staff, and seemingly family-style management could not fulfill the lack of any resemblance to good quality Turkish food. No dozen or so of salty, just made cheeses, fresh ayran, divine boreks, light airy mezes... of course kebabs and a few vegetable mezes were on the menu, but there is so much more to this cuisine! We tried haydari, hummus and sigara boregi, as well as iskender kebab on our first night here. Everything was heavy and very oily. Kebab was ok, but appetizers tasted nothing like I ate in Turkey. On the second visit we had lahmacun and kayseri mantisi and it was the same story - my mantisi were floating in a puddle of oil and I could not eat anything but the top layer. Baklava perhaps was the most exciting dish we tried, but it was served with a plain, tasteless brown liquid, an intruder that dared to call itself Turkish coffee. Overall, an expensive and hardly memorable meal., I was in DC for a business, went to ottoman taverna.had the Levrek and hunkarbegindi And It was as good as in Turkey we also tried baklava which was good but I had better. Would definatelly be back., We went to this new location that opened in our neighborhood. We tried mezze platter and a sigara boregi they were delicious and very fresh. As the main couse we had the lamb chops, doner, iskender, and levrek. Amazingly good. We also shared a baklave, it was good but i had better before. Definitely we will be back., One of the most exquisite, deeply satisfying, and flavourful meals I have ever had. Out party could not stop ordering and eating despite being full, which we fully attribute to not our expanding bellies but the incredibly talented kitchen of Ottoman Taverna. We will be back again and again . . ., The food was salty and just did not taste good. Drinks were terrible!! I had to return my food and so did another person at our table. The wait staff was very sweet and polite so the 2 stars are only for them., Absolutely gorgeous venue. The food was awesome. Each dish seems to be carefully crafted with authentic flavored. Havent had high quality upscale Turkish food in DC in quite some time. This place is fantastic for groups and family style meals. kunefe is one of my favorite deserts and the Kunefe here is definitely one of the best Ive had. The two bottles of wine we had were red Turkish wines and were phenomenal. We had a bottle of the Karma, and a bottle of something else but I cant remember the name., New upscale Turkish restaurant in the area. I have to say that I love the name of the restaurant more than the food!The interior is beautiful and huge perfect for a big groups! Simple decoration.Some of the food was good and some was okay!! but too pricey for what you get!! Waaaay too pricey! My friends weren really impressed with their orders and thought its expensive for a platter like shawarma. Most of them theye ordered-Iskender kebab: thinly sliced lamb and beef doner kebab served over toasted pita bread $22.50-tavuk Iskender: thinly sliced chicken over toasted pita bread $21.75-my entree hunkar begendi slow braised lamb shank served over eggplant pur39e. It was really good but not worth $23.75 Appetizers:-lentil soup: small portion and very bland $8- caban salad: tomatoes, cucumber, onions and feta cheese. Small portion for $8.25 -humus and Muhamara were $7 and it tasted just ok.Dessert:-Baked Rice pudding it a very light dessert and tasted really good $7.75That was my favorite dessert-Kunefeh: was very dry, sweet and expensive! $9.25The wait staff were very nice and attentive! The hostesses were welcoming and friendly!, This restaurant is really beautiful, but unfortunately the food was barely mediocre. My friend and I had the cold mezze sampler and two warm mezzes. I should mention I love Turkish food. Love, love, love it. Take your dollars to Zaytinya instead. Always scrumptious., We live in the neighborhood and we decided to give Ottoman taverna a try. I have to say its the best food Ive eaten recently. The ambience is beautiful and so inviting. We started off with the imam bayildi which is a perfect roasted eggplant dish and falafel. For our entrees, we decided to go for the hunkar begendi which is a perfectly cooked lamb shank served over eggplant puree and tavada levrek. The food is simply outstanding. Its definitely a place to be on our favorite DC restaurants. Cant wait to try other menu selections the next time we come., Heres my second experience of this Turkish restaurant, Excellent food, fresh unique ingredients, beautiful wine pairing and impeccable service.The first mini courses were excellent and my main dish was goat cheese pita flat bread,Hunkar Begendi the food was as usual awesome, Out of interest I read some of the less than 5 star reviews out of curiosity as I have been to many best restaurants and as I previously stated, this was the best.Next time, i will come back with my family., Great new addition to the neighborhood,we decided to try this new location. We had the mere platter and cigara boregi as appetizers.They were very tasty and fulfilling. We tried the lamb chops, hunker begendi and the tabuk shish kebab.. Excellent. I would definatelly recommend. Another must try us the surface desert., Ottoman Taverna brings upscale Turkish food with lots of flavor and variety. I really enjoyed my visit. My friend and I ordered WAY too much food, probably because Im used to small plates being measly portions (cough cough Dabney cough). Ottoman does not skimp you on the portions, which I felt were fair. The small plates are perfectly designed to be split between 3 people. I ended up taking home leftovers that I cant wait to dig into! They start off with complimentary pita with butter and a spicy spread. We ordered:-Shephards Salad - exactly what you would expect-Confit Garlic Hummus - delish-Grape leaves - grape leaves are literally my favorite food, and these did not disappoint-Feta wrapped dough - so tasty! But definitely rich and heavy-Lamb & beef kofte - My favorite dish of the night, so incredibly delicious and flavorful-Suckulu flatbread - Skip this one, its basically pepperoni pizzaI didnt try any of the entree sized plates, as I enjoyed the variety of what we ordered in small plates. Ordering three dishes per person was a bit much, shouldve only ordered two. But, considering the variety of what we ordered, I wish there was just one other person to share with, rather than less dishes. The service was really nice, but they didnt explain the menu or what they recommended ordering. The decor of the restaurant is breathtaking! A solid 4 stars., The lamb was good, but I dont think I would ever go back. The food was just average for the price., Excellent lunch at Ottoman Taverna. The food was outstanding, the space gorgeous, the service warm and attentive and the prices very reasonable given the high quality of the food. For essentially the same price as a wrap at Cava I got a delicious lamb sandwich in pita served with very good fries. The meat in the sandwich was plentiful, not too fatty (as is often the case with lamb) and had a delicious marinated flavor. Before the meal came we were given a disk of sesame crusted soft bread with butter and a harissa spread. The bread, which had the consistency between a thick pita and a loaf of Italian bread, was warm and delicious. We also ordered hummus which was a nice size portion, perfect for sharing, was served with pita chips and was quite frankly the best hummus I have had stateside. The service was excellent, though to be fair our waiter had only our table to tend to as the restaurant was empty but for ours and another two or three parties. The space is huge and very bright and elegant. More people should be filling this place and enjoying the delicious food and refined atmosphere there. Particularly at the surprisingly fair prices they charge. This place is a gem and is well worth a 5-10 minute walk from the Gallery place area., First of all, the restaurant is beautiful. The seating is excellent and the service was top notch. Our food came very fast despite it being crowded and busy on a Saturday night. Most importantly, I think this might be my favorite restaurant. I was glad I had the chance to try several dishes and all of them did not disappoint me at all. Instead, I stuffed myself. I truly believe that if you are looking for something rich in taste and delightful to eat, then you should definitely come and dine here., Amazing food, beautiful restaurant, great service! The food definitely ranks top 3 in DC hands down. Authentic Turkish food as well as a few modern dishes. The ravioli with garlic yogurt is great! Would definitely come back, Absolutely fantastic , owner has created an entire experience for customers with Elegant surroundings personalized professional servers ,delicious and eloquently plated dishes as well as decorations and design sets this restaurant apart from others .We ordered quite a bit to say least.. And our waiter full filled our requests as desired .So i create a list starting with Sevilen Rose ...Dry but perfect for hot summer nights , must try mezze platter and zucchini patties as starter As for the main corse I was very impressed with Iskender kebab , I was pleasantly surprise to find meat was to perfect temperature ,tender and succulent . As we were finishing up our bottle of Rose we requested our dessert selection of Kunefe was bomb must try ..All in all we will definitely come here again the food timing , service and ambiance were all excellent well worth it., This place is fabulous! From the decoration to the food! The bar area is amazing! And the food! Oh the food..... DELICIOUS authentic Turkish food that transports you to turkey in every bite. Kunefe by the way is absolutely amazing!, I tried this location on a Saturday night. We had great experience , service and the food was amazing.For the appetizer we shared the mezzo platter. For theMain course I had the salmon and my girlfriend had the hunker behe di, both very good. For desert we shared a kunefe which was delicious.I will be back, This review is for happy hour. While the HH menu isnt huge, everything on it is $5. My husband and I went in the middle of the week, right at about 5pm, so we were able to beat the crowd. Unfortunately, the day that we picked was also a work-sponsored event that had about 25 extra people hanging out around the bar and ordering every single thing on the menu, not just HH. I guess Ottoman Taverna doesnt have a private space? Anyway, the HH drinks arent extensive -- youve got a red, white, sparkling, sangria, and a few beers. Im always happy with wine, especially when its sparkling. My husband had a few beers and switched to their red. The decor of the entire place is absolutely gorgeous. They did a fantastic job. I wish Id taken a picture of what the inside looked like, but sitting at the bar -- it seemed too obvious! When we decided to put in our food orders, they brought out some complimentary pita with different spreads. The spreads were very flavorful, but we had to continue to flag someone down for another refill. They also brought out another complimentary dish, which Im not sure the name of. It was basically a lettuce wrap filled with meat. It looked kind of odd, almost like tartare, but it definitely was cooked and was very tasty. I wish I could remember the name! We ended up ordering the grilled spicy beef sausage and the falafel. Both were very delicious, and we were actually pretty full after as the portions were bigger than we thought. We had some time to check out the full menu, but everything looked very overpriced. I would go back for the HH for sure, since its close by, but probably not dinner. All in all, a pretty good experience., Being from Turkey I am very picky when it comes to Turkish food. We tried this place both for brunch & dinner and they passed with flying colors. Recommend it to anyone who enjoys Mediterranean food., Vibrant ambiance.We went there for dinner with friends on a Saturday night and we were pleasantly surprised with the food taste and variety. We had a variety of exotic appetizers with eggplants, walnuts and other typical mediterranean ingredients. All were yummy. Their bread is also quite fresh and delicious. For the main courses, we had Adana Kabab and the Lamb chops. Both were tasty.As for the dessert, I think they can do a bit better as the variety seems to be limited and less exotic than the rest of the menu., Very nice, white tablecloth Turkish/Greek Restaurant. We went with our three year old granddaughter for a 1:30 Lunch. Food was wonderful....meze is noteworthy. Grandaughter loved the pistachio ice cream.Beautifully designed restaurant., We had a terrific dinner at Ottoman Taverna two months later they opened. The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing. I have been to many Turkish restaurants in the US from east coast to west coast but this was absolutely the best and only one that completely satisfied me and my husband. We ordered several appetizers including meze platter, sigara boregi, zucchini pancake, falafel and cigkofte. Every single thing they served was unique, sophisticated, subtle, and delicious. Then I ordered Iskender kebab and my husband ordered manti. My dish was so tasty, our server told us that they make the doner (shaved meat in 40skender kebab) in the house. That makes a huge difference, its fresh and never frozen. Manti was also good but I dont know if its for everybody. You need to like yogurt in your food in order to like manti. And the dessert...Kunefe is a must try. I can drive 3 hours to eat their Kunefe again. It is mouth watering....Our server was very friendly and took good care of us. It was a great atmosphere, light and airy. We will definitely come back when we visit Washington DC again., Love this place! The staff is fastidious and friendly. We have only ordered from the small plates, but all are delicious. Cocktails are somewhat unusual, but pretty good. It is pricy. But the staff treats you like they appreciate you being there. Dont see that too much. Outdoor seating and dog friendly. DOG FRIENDLY! Will keep going!, I waited to write this review until after my second visit to this restaurant and I was happy have the same great experience as the first time. The restaurant has a great ambiance, with a decor that is modern with a touch of traditional Turkish accents. It is also spacious and very clean with a semi-open kitchen. Given that this place is only couple of months old, it is pretty busy on Saturday evenings, but making reservations (even last minute) was not an issue. The food is really really good. The menu is full of traditional Turkish dishes and everything we have tried, from hot and cold appetizers, main entrees, and dessert have been amazing. The way they prepare the lamb (e.g. lamb chops, sis) is phenomenal; zero gaminess! The staff is courteous and nices although their service is a tad spotty. I think it is mainly because the place is new and I think they are still trying to get a hang of things. For instance, 2 or more servers might service the table, and it was a bit hard to flag them down to ask for something that we needed. Over all, I really enjoyed dining at O.T. and I am sure I will be back soon. Hoping they resolve the minor kinks with their service., A wonderful addition to the Turkish cuisine scene in DC! I travel far and wide to eat kunefe and it is now available just an Uber ride away. Imagine my joy!Ottoman Taverna has pretty much everything you need for a wonderful Turkish food experience. From the fantastic wait staff who are on top of your drink and food orders to the delectable food, everything is taken care of. The cocktail menu is small yet well-executed. I had the Sultans of Swing - plum gin+ginger+spices, which was spectacular. A perfect summer cocktail with the refreshing flavors of plum, ginger, clove, and cardamom (gosh, I sound like one of those pretentious foodies writing this!) The wine list is extensive - more on the expensive side. It would be nice to see more wines in the $25-35 per bottle range. Most of them are $40 and above. We ordered a Kavakildere rose, which paired well with most of our food. There is a good selection of Greek wines and I was happy to see my favorite Agiorgitiko and a Xinomavro from Naoussa region on the list. Food: we ordered a few mezze and shared a main course. Our friend ordered a main course for himself. The artichoke hearts and roasted eggplant are tasty, but my favorite is the cabbage leaves stuffed with meat. It was so good that I used the bread to sop the gravy/ juices in the dish. We ordered the lamb shank over eggplant puree for our main dish. The kitchen was considerate enough to cut the big lamb shank in two portions knowing that we are sharing the dish. Now that is what I call excellent service. The lamb did not need a knife, it came apart with the touch of a fork. Perfectly cooked with the smoky flavor of the eggplant adding a nice touch. Our friend ordered the cauliflower and chickpea stew, which was excellent as well.Now, to the raison d3atre I selected this place for dinner - kunefe! I have eaten kunefe in Israel, Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan. I consider myself an expert on kunefe. Ottomans kunefe is easily a 4/5 stars on the kunefe scale. Freshly made with the right cheese and syrup combo, it transported me back to the streets of Akko. My dessert-loving belly was super happy after this experience. I can see myself hanging out at the bar area for happy hour and having a nice meal with friends or date night with the husband. You just won yourself a loyal customer. G3cr3c5f3cr3cz, Ottoman Taverna!, Came here for happy hour a few Fridays ago. Got there relatively early (5:30) and was happy to find a chill bar and restaurant with only a 4-5 other tables sat. The bartenders were really attentive and friendly, explaining the different drinks and dishes to us as we ordered. We had 4-5 different dishes and a couple of drinks each. Everything we ordered was really tasty and a range of new and different blends of flavors!, Dinner with friends here was amazing! Great cocktails (a little pricey for the amount given) and an even better selection of appetizers. You could come here and fill up just on a bunch of those--we had the hummus, haydari, zucchini cakes, and falafel; all delicious. Wide selection of entrees as well though I was less enthused with my chicken kabob (forgotten the Turkish name). It was very tasty but nothing special after the appetizers we had. Phenomenal ambiance and waitstaff--very attentive and knowledgable. A bit more of a splurge place if youre on a budget but I would highly recommend., Ive been to many restaurants in my life, but this one takes the cake. They have absolutely delicious food. Although it was our first time here, I can vouch for their Meze ( their hummus is mouth watering); their Adana; and their Kunefe( dessert).Not only is their food spectacular, but their service is impeccable!! All the servers are amazing, but my favorite is Frederique (sp). She went above all the standards of restaurant service and literally entertained our son ( almost one and a half years of age ) the entire time while we ate! She mentioned that she understood how hard it can be to parent and eat at the same time, so she wanted to take the weight off our shoulders for some minutes. And although they were only some minutes, it was a gesture and favor my husband and I will never forget and an experience that is going in our books of favorite eateries ! Definitely coming back to this outstanding restaurant again!!! Thank you so much Frederique!!, Love LOVESUPER DUPER cute place - minus the Tvs high on the wall that cast their din from the bar into the rest of the space - why??? Why must there be tvs everywhere.Any who the food is rockstar!!! Rockstar! Eat everything! The wine list is so refreshing and not cliche. BONUS POINTS for Greek Wine!Even the cocktails are lovely without the endless 42 ingredients - just perfect!The staff (though still in training obviously) are super cute and flirty, and not pushy - though we would have had a bother bottle of wine had the waiter asked.And as always my pet peeve: the host stand - please please train the hostess/host staff.This place is super cheap to boot!, Cool new place. Great bites and drinks after work. The sangria was unique and refreshing! Yummy fresh bread and excellent hummus that tasted homemade. Definitely will go back!!, I wanted to like this place, but everything was too salty, heavy, oily. Maybe good for people who dont know what Turkish food is supposed to taste like? Not that 10-days of eating in Istanbul makes me an expert on Turkish food...but I think I know enough to say that this place isnt good., We took my mom to this restaurant on the last night of her visit. Wow, the food was awesome. We ordered a whole series of mezze and everything was delicious. The cigars, lamb and kebab were standouts. The decor is very cool- a fusion of hip and modern with traditional ottoman., My friend and I were here for DC Restaurant Week and with Michelle Obama having eaten here and 4.5 stars on Yelp our expectations were high. Sadly we both felt quite disappointed and ripped off. We both started off with the Shepherd Salad, which I thought was pretty good but she said lacked some the ingredients missing the cucumbers and quality tomatoes used in Turkey, where she has been five times. For my entree I got the Sumakli Salmon which was good and soft on the top but seemed hard and overcooked on the bottom. The rice with it seemed stuck together and not freshly made. My friend got the Doner Kebab and she said the lamb was not tender like she expected it to be. For desert I got the Sekarpare and she got the Rice Pudding. We both shared each others deserts and felt the Rice Pudding was the best part of the meal. The Sekarpare was good but we would have hoped for it to be warm and not room temperature. The service was also lacking in that I had to remind them to bring out my drink which was Efe Rake Green which is a Turkish version of Arak. It was a good sized portion for only $10. My friend got the Pamukkale Senfoni which they only filled up the very bottom of the wine glass for at a cost of $12. With the amount we paid for very mediocre food, I would not expect to come back or recommend this place to others. It is quite possible the food was more prepared in high quantities ahead of time for restaurant week. However, a few others I know came earlier that evening and highly recommend this place, especially the pita and hummus which I would try if I do happen to be back along with some Efe Rake but wouldnt order off the Restaurant Week menu., food was quite good service was horrendous. we saw our sever three times(once for drinks, once for our order and once for the check). He never came back to refill water or take a other drink order. its a shame because the food and ambiance were nice and with good services this would be a place I would return to. with the horrible service we received its not worth the trip, I really wanted to love this place, but came up disappointed. Im really giving it 3.5 stars but rounding up. My girlfriends and I came here for brunch. I got the red lentil soup, which was good but not for $9 and the tabbouleh salad. The salad was greasy and soggy. All i could taste was tomato paste and the oils. My friends got the kabob, and the flatbread which were okay, but not great. We topped it off with tea, rice pudding, and baklava. The rice pudding was decent but more like a custard, and the baklava was overpriced for what it was. it was very soggy, syrupy, and too sweet. the decor is beautiful, but hoping that in time it gets better. id give it another try but perhaps id do dinner.
53|pennsylvania-6-dc-washington|Penn 6 is an exceptional restaurant - the food, cocktails, atmosphere and service were nothing short of perfect. You cant beat the $1 oysters for happy hour, best Caesar salad around and the steak, lobster roll and bucatini and clams were all delicious. Dont miss out on this new restaurant before its too hard to get into., Pennsylvania 6 is an absolutely phenomenal restaurant, easily beating the absolute pants off other places in D.C. Penn 6 is an American brasserie meets London supper club near the McPherson Square Metro. The location is convenient but the interior is extremely cozy - it trendy without being silly about it, and it American without coming off too try-hard. There even a little Ralph Lauren-esque nook with a fireplace and couches near the bar. This is precisely the kind of place and aesthetic that D.C. needs more of.The food here is excellent. While I routinely complain on here about generic D.C. New American cuisine, Penn 6 does it in a way that isn lazy or stodgy. I tried both the Lamb Shoulder Ragout and the Roasted Chicken Diablo, and both were absolutely delicious - the Ragout was super hearty and tasty, whereas the Diablo was basically the best roasted chicken Ie had in an American restaurant. The desserts are also worth a look - both the Bread & Butter Pudding and Bolivian Chocolate Terrine are ridiculously good (not to mention huge, in the case of the pudding). The price of the entire meal was extremely reasonable.Service here is also ridiculously good - my glass never even approached halfway empty and our waiter was ridiculously nice and personable. You can tell this place is new - the General Manager and Assistant General Manager both seemed to be hustling - but that a good thing.This place has definitely changed my opinion on American food, and Il definitely be back., I went to Pennsylvania 6 for the first time to meet up with friends from out of town. This place is amazing. The decor is sophisticated, the atmosphere is inviting and the bar is clean and has a phenomenal cocktail list. We grabbed drinks before we were seated then had the best dinner I have ever had in D.C. We started with the Shishito Peppers, Broccolini Dip, and the Sardinian flat bread. All were fantastic. We also had a great selection of oysters from the raw bar and the Kingfish Crudo...PHENOMENAL. Actually the best raw bar I have ever eaten from. Additionally we got the Chicken entree and the Sweet Potato and Kale salad then finished up with the Bread Pudding and the Lemon Meringue Eclair. The food was so good and everyone was accommodating and friendly. I would go back anytime., This restaurant is on track with excellent table service and a vibrant dining atmosphere. With less than a month under their belt, they are still working out their identity in a competitive restaurant space. I had a very good chicken dinner, but there was nothing special about the dish. There was no soul in this food. Maybe it was my fault for ordering chicken, but that dish was recommended to me so I went with it. The menu has some technically solid offerings, but I didnt see anything that would make me feel like the fare was special in any way. I felt like the space was somewhat quirky in its decor and it did not match the electronic music piped throughout. I was able to engage with a bourbon and grape mash cocktail that was superb and certainly helped me add a personality to the bar offerings. It is this personality that is needed on the menu., DC is home to many great restaurants. Pennsylvania 6 is one of the best. Service is attentive without feeling overbearing. Food was incredible. The octopus was delicious. The pork chop pairs perfectly with the bourbon glaze. The ricotta was amazing. Great atmosphere, service, quality food., Oh, man! Best company party that Ive ever been to. It helps that the small company that I work for has very cool staff, including the principals, but the passed apps, drinks, and buffet really made a difference. Standouts included the the very tasty oyster shooters that had good-sized fresh oysters in them, and the crab balls, so I think that they do a very nice job with seafood. The buffet was good, but the sauteed mix of mushrooms also made my day., This place has the best food and the best service! I called and spoke with the manager and they opened their doors early for our party to partake in a very decadent meal. If you want something light-the seared tuna is to die for. Also for dessert the coffee is very good as it has a hint of dark chocolate and hazelnut. Also yet another reason to visit, Pennsylvania 6 is a big sponsor of going green! It does not use paper towels in the restrooms, instead your are giving a fresh wash cloth to dry your hands., Had an amazing dinner here! A great variety of seafood and meat dishes. We enjoyed a half dozen oysters that were fresh and delicious as well as the Wild Burgundy Snails to start off our meal. The snails had a nice earthy taste with bone marrow butter and some great herbs. For our entrees we had the rare tuna was celeriac pur39e and spicy broccolini and the lamb shoulder ragout. We thought both entrees were scrumptious, but the tuna was our favorite. For dessert we shared the mini crime br3bl39es. We chose two bourbon vanilla and one chocolate (opting out of pumpkin spice). The vanilla was delicious, but the chocolate was even better! With sea salt on top it was the icing on the cake to this fantastic meal. In regards to drinks, I enjoyed the Treaty of Paris which is pur39ed honeydew mixed with elderflower liqueur, champagne and garnished with prosciutto. The flavors meshed so well together and the salty prosciutto on top was a strange concept for me at first but I enjoyed it very much. I highly recommend dining here!, I have to join the chorus -- Pennsylvania 6 DC has outstanding food.For lunch I shared the Sardinian flatbread and the skillet-fried shishito peppers, then got the seafood Louie. All delicious.Looking forward to exploring more of the very interesting menu!NB: Dollar oysters at happy hour!, One of the best dining experiences Ive ever had. Good first impression when I called to make reservations for a group of 5 friends. They offer valet parking for $9 which I highly recommend.Really nice looking space. Had the best Old Fashioned ever! Louisiana fried oysters were superb. Our server, Ellen, was knowledgeable, professional yet personable. She suggested the skillet fried Shishito peppers which was not something I was drawn to but turned out to be a fun and exciting choice without the audacity I was expecting. I had the bucatini and clams. A highly tasty and satisfying choice. Sadly I was too full to indulge in dessert. The noise level was comfortable and tables were nicely distributed. I find it odd when I go to a fancy restaurant and the tables are so close that you can overhear conversations or cant walk by without nudging someone. The bar has generous seating and flat screen TV so after our meals the guys and I moved over there to watch a thrilling football game between Steelers and Bengals. It was late and restaurant was closing but they permitted us to watch the entire game and didnt make us feel like we were an inconvenience. This place is like a great pair of deep indigo jeans. You can dress it up with a smart sport coat or wear it casually with a tee shirt. Its all good!, All I want to say - Penn 6 is a great addition to the neighborhood. The staff was super friendly and fun. The food is fantastic. Big favorites of the night were pork chop and bread pudding. Well be back soon., Tasty food, excellent sommelier, great service. I wish it was closer to my office so I could go there more often., Ambiance: 5Food: 5Service: 5Cost/Performance Ratio: 5 (Great for oyster lover at Happy Hour and Restaurant Week)Overall: 5Quick tips: 1. They are extending the January DC restaurant week to Feb 3 due to inclement weather.2. Happy hour offers Chesapeake oysters for $1. No special price on drinks.Service was impeccable! Our waitress was very professional, knew what the food tastes like and what to recommend based on your preference, and above all, very tentative. She switched out silverware for appetizer, entree and dessert and kept our cups filled. The interior is spacious and charming, making you feel quite relaxed. We didn bother the sommelier, but bargained for some table bread that are still being tested for perfection.Food tastes phenomenal. Given it is restaurant week, it easily boosts the value index to a solid 5. An order of crab croquettes comes with five pieces, not stingy on the crab meat at all. Roasted chicken diablo was very tender and has excellent portion. A little extra drizzle of S&P won hurt. You can also ask for a teeny-tiny bottle of Tobasco sauce or take one home for souvenir. If you eat sushi from time to time, yellowfin tuna is a great choice. Since they specialize in fresh daily raw seafood, the quality of the tuna and oysters will satisfy the pickiest crowd. It unfortunate that lobster roll was not on restaurant week tasting menu since it tends to sell on its own quickly. As for dessert, I spice apple cake was the winner of the two choices they offeredOverall, this was a great experience. Catch the extension for restaurant week and check it out for yourself., Love! Love! Love! I a huge fan of their sister restaurant City Tap House, but I have to say that Penn 6, is equally amazing. Now I have to spend time at both places.  Food & Drinks - wonderful tasteful variety. I like to start with the Yellowfin Tuna TarTare, the Louisiana Fried Oysters, Marinated Olives, and Bandaged Wrapped Cheddar. Then add the final touch with an order of a delicious Sweet Potato & Kale salad and a Lamb Shoulder Ragout. All while, I drink a bottle of red wine (Tempranillo or a Malbec) - the Sommelier can help you decide, which wine best suits you - or even a intricately prepared superior cocktail will seal the deal. These are just my personal favorites, but I certain that you will enjoy anything you order.  Happy Hour - BEST $1 Oysters, Monday through Friday from 4-7pm. I don usually write the BEST, but these oysters deserve that title. These oysters have the whole package: presentation, size, freshness, taste, and price.  Atmosphere: The d39cor and different rooms are fantastic. When you step into the restaurant, it feels as like youe in a different era.  Location - It conveniently located across the street from McPherson Square Metro. In between 13th & 14th Street, along Eye Street.  Staff/Servers - Phenomenal. From their friendly smiles & greetings when you first walk through the door to being very-well-dressed and professional, they really exemplify excellent service.Now, my fellow Yelp readers/Yelpers, it your turn to check it out for yourself. Youl love it!, This place is PERFECT for groups, and foodies like me! From start to finish the service was excellent and over the top (thanks to our lovely servers for playing along with our groups games). I enjoyed oysters (yes!), the PE6 salad (wouldve loved more, but it saved room for the yummy entree I couldnt finish) and the Lamb Shoulder Ragout. The dish was more than memorable, and the leftovers let me enjoy it all over again the next day for lunch. The decor/setting is just gorgeous and inviting as well. Ahhhh, so happy about this addition to downtown dining!!!, 4.5 StarsA Keystone State import brought to you by the folks behind the City Tap House, Pennsylvania 6 name is a reference to the phone exchange (PE 6) of the famed Pennsylvania Hotel in New York. It trying its best to be a power spot, and for the most part it seems to be working. Occupying the space that previously housed Tuscana West, the first thing that strikes you when you walk into Pennsylvania 6 is the giant, 30-seat marble-topped wrap-around bar,. The rest of the space is filled with sofas, armchairs, and nooks that give it a gentleman club-type feel; the bartenders even sport ties and vests. The only thing that distracts from the atmosphere are the large flatscreen TVs above the bar. The menu is dominated by seafood, whether the plateau of seafood a la Oceannaire, or the mains of scallops and yellowfin tuna. While they had both East Coast and West Coast oysters, I opted for an order topneck clams from the raw bar and was not disappointed; the clams were fresh, clean, and not chewy, and came with fresh horseradish for the cocktail sauce. There are 14 draft beers including 3 Star Peppercorn Saison, and Dogfish Head 90 minute; oddly, given it name and provenance, the only Pennsylvania beer was Troegs Hopback Amber. Other liquid refreshment included 60 types of whiskey (20 of them Scotch), and a house specialty cocktail called the Treaty of Paris, made with sparkling wine, honeydew melon, and prosciutto (yes, prosciutto ham, it floated on top)!Service was excellent without being obsequious, and although they seem to be shooting for the expense account crowd, definitely worth a gander if your in the Franklin Square area, or have a hankering for good seafood., What can can be said about this place that isnt a blatant clich39? The decor is lively and has an oddly brilliant old fashioned feel to it. The food is wonderfully crafted, no....EXPERTLY crafted specifically to bring your taste buds on journey they wont ever forget. Wait. What? None of this is clich39d at all? Its because nothing at this restaurant is. Ive been to many a restaurant, and Ive never quite been to a place like Pennsylvania 6, that has that kind of special...feel...to it. Its not only about the food, but the experience you get while eating it. This restaurant delivers those experiences in droves, from the music and decor, to the amazing staff. Go to Pennsylvania 6 and you wont be disappointed., My very good friend and I wanted to do a impromptu brunch date to celebrate and picked this wonderful establishment. Not too far from a metro stop and there seemed to be ample street parking. The restaurant is lovely, and spaced well. Interior is darker in color to create a intimate setting, so I can see myself coming back here for a date night. During the day, the shades are pulled and natural sunlight brings a jubilant vibe. I first started with a Bloody Mary, since no bunch is complete without it. The drink was made the way I like it: Goose vodka, olives, and extra spicy! My friend and I also got champagne to celebrate a belated birthday! The manager was so kind and offered us a glass and trip the ever pretty, Champagne Bar. If anyone wants to throw a Bridal shower or get together for a birthday, I recommend this! They do private events as well. There was an array of juices, purees, bitters, and fruit/herbs to flavor and decorate your glass! Very impressed with the display and spread. The menu itself had quite a few choices and in the end my friend and I chose to share fresh Oysters, Yellowfin Tuna Tar Tar, Lobster Roll, and Eggs Benedict. All delicious and well made. The Oysters were sized nicely and came with the regular garnishes. Tuna Tar Tar came with plantain chips, and the mango with aioli was delicious. Lobster roll was creamy, and not shy of meat. The Eggs Benedict was uniquely made with plenty of greens, perfectly poached eggs, and fried crab croquettes. My friend and I were very satisfied with our selections!The service was tentative, efficient, and friendly. I couldn be happier with the overall experience of this place. I will definitely be coming back to try other dishes!, I went to Pennsylvania 6 for lunch with two of my friends today. We had a great waitress who was very attentive. But for some reason my one friends oysters too forever to arrive to the table. The manager came over and told us lunch was on him. We just assumed he meant the one meal. NO, he meant our ENTIRE tab of $163.00. Talk about above and beyond. What amazing customer service. And to top it off all of our food was incredibly good, atmosphere was great and our waitress was awesome. So kudos to this restaurant for knowing the importance of customer satisfaction. I would have gone back even without the lovely gesture from the manager., Really enjoyed dinner here last night (Valentines Day prix fixee). The space was very appealing, the tables were far from each other and felt very private, and the service was good. Most impressive were the wine pairings, which were perfect and creative, and I learned a lot from (and the pours were very generous). The deserts and desert wine pairing were particularly memorable. The food was very good - maybe slightly small In quantity, but I did not leave hungry. Will definitely go back for a meal off the regular menu., We stopped outside to check out the lunch menu and while looking at the options, Jill, a waitress came out while on break. She stopped and asked if she could help us...the start of a wonderful experience!! After reviewing some of her favorites, she took us inside to meet Connor, the Silver Fox bartender. He became our server and Jill took her break. Cant say enough about these two employees and their recommendations for wine and food. Conner recommended a red and a white wine which were excellent and spot on in our price point. Jill had recommended fried oysters and tuna tartare, which were both superb. My husband got a burger and fries...he loved it but the fries were cooked in duck oil which wasnt to my liking, however it wasnt my meal!We did notice that as the restaurant was getting busier, other waitstaff were waiting on us and I must say they definitely did not have the personalities of Jill and Conner! Not sure we would have been as impressed as we are if they had been our only interface to the restaurant. Loved it; will be back; will ask for Jill or Conner!!, On lunch special value alone this joint gets 5 stars. For $10 you get half a sandwich and a salad or soup. AND they get you in and out in a half hour if you are in a rush.This was my first Penn 6 experience but I have heard lots of great things from friends so my expectations were set higher than normal. Not to worry, they lived up to the expectations. I arrived early for lunch and was promptly greeted at the bar by a waiter who told me about the amazing lunch value, arguably one of the best in DC!I got the pulled roasted chicken and the classic Caesar. The sandwich was outstanding. Mushrooms, kale, cheddar, and bacon. Did I mention bacon? Delicious.I will definitely be back. I wonder if they have a happy hour special that is anywhere near as good as the lunch special. If so, this may be a new regular spot thrown into the rotation.Give it a shot, at $10 for lunch, what do you have to lose?, After reading great reviews we decided to take a chance, even though we had 5 small children with us. We were seated promptly, and our server Derek went out of his way to make us feel right at home. We indulged in oysters, great seafood entrees, sandwiches and burgers, and wrapped up our meal with some unique flavored gelato. Food was great (even kids menu), service was exceptional and definitely plan on returning next time we are in the city.The General Manager Pearson was also very kind and attentive., Service was terrible! We sat in the lounge it was dead and the service for our $200 meal was terrible. Food was good but cmon if you can wait the table doesnt matter how good it is.Update, on the way out the general manager stopped us to apologized for the poor service, comped our bill and gave up 2 gift cards. I will revisit!!, Exceptional staff (bartender and waiter) and food! Had a great post dinner conversation with the manager, Pierce -- hes relatively new to the location and appears to be customer focused., This is a nice little place with a delicious lobster roll and duck fat fries. The sever was very kind and polite and we enjoyed our meal here. I hesitate to give it 5 stars since this was my only visit and we only tried on thing on the menu. The only downfall was a dirty drink glass that had to be removed...waiter said it looked like a leftover lemon seed in the bottom of the glass., Update on 13 July: I finally had a chance to get back to Pennsylvania 6 last night, and Im glad I did. The service was on point; the staff was as attentive as you would hope, but they werent getting in the way or hovering excessively. The menu looked very different from what I remember from my first visit, and food was much improved. The steak tartare was flavorful and not overdone with seasonings like mustard or caper like some restaurants do. I also had the braised beef short ribs, which were pretty tasty. The meat was a little dry, but it worked well with the sauce. All in all, its a good restaurant in a great location. This wouldnt be a bad place to go for a business dinner.Original review: Underwhelmed is the only way I can describe my experience. Pennsylvania 6 has a very nice space that has the look and feel of a nice steakhouse, but the food was mediocre and the service was nonexistent. We sat in the bar area, which was only 1/4 full, and we still had to hunt for our server each time we needed anything. Over the course of the meal, we had 3 or 4 different people waiting on us, and we had to take our check to the bar because nobody came to collect it. As for the food, the foie gras mousse was pretty good. The lamb shoulder ragout was short on meat and the sauce tasted like Chef Boyardees. It was supposed to have mushrooms and goat cheese, neither of which could be found on the plate. I cant remember what else we had, but it wasnt anything impressive.This place has potential, but theyre falling short of the mark for now. Ill go back in a few months and see if theyve gotten their waitstaff organized and their menu cleaned up. For what youre paying, its not someplace Im going to rush to go to in the near future., I went to Pennsylvania 6 DC for a birthday dinner. The restaurant was busy during prime dinner hours (weekend). I ordered lamb shoulder ragout (shaved crimini mushroom salad,rigatoncini pasta, & aged goat cheese) as an appetizer. The pasta was cooked well and very flavorful. All of the ingredients blended well together. I had a lobster roll with duck fat fries as my main entree. This was my first time trying a lobster roll. It was delicious, along with Pennsylvania 6 duck fat fries. For dessert, we had bread & butter pudding (black currants, butterscotch sauce, with milk chocolate gelato). The bread pudding and gelato was tasty. Our waitress service was average at best. She didnt stay on top of our table. It was a birthday dinner, so I was disappointed with service since reservations were made early. Staff was very professional and polite. Pennsylvania 6 DC has a nice romantic ambience. The bar area has TVs to watch sports. I give Pennsylvania 6 DC a 3.5 rating because our food was tasty., I love that this place is all party up front and then super classy in the back. The happy hour at the bar was jam packed, though looked like there may have been a special event as I saw lots of people wearing nametags. The raw bar seems like one of the more popular features but I cant speak to it yet as I didnt have anything from it. My boyfriend and I were on a date night so we went to the classy side lol and had a nice corner table. Penn 6 would be a great spot to host private parties, they have plenty of options for closing different sections off. In fact, while we were there, I noticed a whole additional section past us that was partitioned and people were coming in and out from a party. I wonder how big this place actually is when all opened up!Anyway, our waitress gave us the rundown on the history of the restaurant and its name as well as the specials and recommendations. After asking about cocktails, she recommended for me the Mirage, which had cactus pear vodka, pomegranate juice, and spices. I was a little disappointed in it as it ended up tasting like Fireball and pom juice... maybe too heavy on the spices. I dont know what a cactus pear is supposed to taste like, but I wouldnt be able to tell you after the drink either. My bf got a bourbon based drink which was nice and smoky. We split the fried crab appetizer which was pretty good, but perhaps a bit over fried. My scallops were delicious! Perfectly cooked. They came over a bed of lentils, and I figured out that evening that I dont actually like lentils... oh well! Thats no fault of Penn 6. My bf got the seafood pasta which he devoured. This was a Friday during Lent so we werent eating meat, which was challenging because there were so many tasty looking options! Id love to come back and try them!, Overall decor was gorgeous however meal itself was eh. Service was ok; not every efficient for an almost empty restaurant. Meal itself was cold and just Ok. Def a B- at best. We had the Dutch baby pancake, steak and eggs, and eggs under purgatory were all cold, expensive and just OK. Idk we just werent fans. The juice bar was really nice though! But not enough to make us want to go back. Sorry!, We had a reservation for 12 people and they graciously accommodated our party. We had a good experience; great service, highly recommend the seafood raw bar and appetizers, steaks and some entrees not so much. They have very good oysters, both East and West varieties. Blackfish crudo is also fresh quite delicious. Highly recommend their fresh ricotta and gras mousse: full of flavor and and perfect for sharing. Charred Spanish octopus is also good, but a small portion.Steaks here are very average. My sister ordered a NY Strip medium rare which came out with a too-dry crust but too red center, and another person who ordered it medium received the steak well-done. Our waiter did give him a replacement along with free duck fat fries. I dont recommend their yellowfin tuna tatare: tiny entree with no interesting flavor...My entree was 10/10: the berkshire pork chop. So juicy and tender, with a perfectly caramelized crust complemented with a topping of lightly candied pecans. The side of fried brussels sprouts were full of flavor and the pureed sweet potato was also good. Order the chop medium-rare for perfect tenderness. Their desserts are also pretty good. Creme brulees are just okay, but their warm apple cake is delicious., Welcoming club type atmosphere. The back dining rooms are elegant and more formal while the front area near the bar is open and light and has large windows facing the park. Exceptional service and friendliness from all of the staff. I dropped in for lunch and highly recommend the strip steak sandwich. Most entr39es are 20 and up so it is a mid to high range restaurant. They were very accommodating in swapping out sides or customizing options.I found this restaurant to be a very relaxing break between appointments for lunch. It would be a lovely spot for dinner or special occasion. There is no Wi-Fi but there are two TVs in the bar area one team to support someone to current news. A very nice experience overall!, I came here with a fellow coworker as we were looking for some grub after looking at cherry blossoms. It sort of bloomed when I was there, but hey I cant have anything. I did however try out Pennsylvania 6 though. My thoughts? I liked it. I came here on a weeknight, and booked a reservation just in case even though it wasnt needed. I would have to say that the prices were a little steep, but its DC and especially since the spot is in prime location downtown the prices make sense. The ambiance is well, like every other review says. It has a luxurious feel with a relaxed atmosphere. Does it mean that you have to dress up super nice? I mean, you can, but then again you could just go in work clothes and sit at the bar for happy hour. *Note that to get happy hour deals, you have to sit at the bar.*To start, we ordered their Yellowfin Tuna Tartare, since my coworker never had it before and was feeling adventurous, I had to oblige. It was tasty! I think It was probably better than the Lobster Roll that we both ordered (he never had a lobster roll as well). Supposedly their lobster roll was voted one of the best? Well I think 14th on top 50 in the nation? What did I think? Ive had better, but it was pretty good. The tartare was on point though.Would I come back? Sure, maybe. I think I would try something else on their menu though. I did enjoy the vibe., Pennsylvania 6 is a great Happy Hour spot. Ive been here several times with numerous groups of colleagues and contacts, as well as for some 1-on-1 meetings. The service is always friendly and quick. They have a great selection of oysters, and their $1 Happy Hour oysters are also excellent. Im a huge fan of their cocktails, particularly the Capitol Solace. They also have a great wine and beer selection. Finally, I havent had a chance to sample their full menu, but have had almost every small plate/appetizer. The food is great! Definitely get the ricotta. Overall, Im a big fan of Pennsylvania 6 and will definitely keep coming here., Pretty good after work dinner place. Nice atmosphere with a lot of people sitting at the bar. They have $1 oysters from 4-7, M-F. Im not big on oysters, so didnt try them this time, but maybe next time.Tried the beet salad. SO GOOD. Roasted beets with arugula and some type of vinaigrette and goat cheese. I couldve used less dressing but thats just me. The grilled octopus was also great with radishes.For the entree, we split the monkfish which had mushrooms at the bottom. Nice and light fish - the sauce was very flavorful and went well drizzled on top. Will definitely return to try more.Service was quick and efficient., Best service in town, excellent food and a great atmosphere. Had Drinks with friends at the bar and then ate dinner which was amazing. The oysters are the best in town and everyone loved their dinner. Also had excellent deserts., Ie said it before, great service is the difference maker in any place of business. This being my first time to this restaurant, the server (Jill) took the time to explain everything and provide some value-added recommendations - Added plus! The food was perfect, great presentation and flavorful. The new assistant manager (Ryan) came over during our meal, to introduce himself and talk to the table about the restaurant and his goal of making everyone experience great. This was the seal the deal for me! I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone visiting the DC area., Love this place! For people living or working in the area its like a classy Cheers--everybody knows your name! Weve eaten here three times once for dinner, brunch and happy hour. It has great oysters, drinks and food. There is a champagne bar during brunch thats super fun and tasty. You get a bottle of your choosing then you can add syrups, fruit etc. from the champagne bar. The Berkshire Pork Chop is tasty and well portioned. The sides were amazing, and I loved the tuna tartare., If I had known that this was the same people as City Tap House then I definitely wouldnt have eaten here. Theres nothing wrong with this and CTH as a bar, but the food is just list CTH in that its sub-par and way overpriced., This place is great. We had the crab croquettes and they were fabulous. I had the pork chop with fried brussel sprouts (who knew!?!?!) and yukon gold pur39e- all was delicious. Husband had lamb Ragu and loved it - Ive never tried lamb and tried this it was awesome - the gravy was to die for!The manager came over and asked how our meal was and then asked where we were from (hostess must have told him we were from out of town) we talked to him about how great Albuquerque is and had s great conversation with him. All in all a great experience!, Excellent service; very attentive waiter and staff. The fish crudu and risotto with fig jam were excellent appetizers. Sweet potatoes and kale salad was yummy. The NY strip steak and lobster sandwich were delicious Visiting DC from Calif and would go back., When a bartender takes the time to ask my name and introduce themselves I automatically fall in love with a restaurant. Hans delivered when I popped in for lunch today. If youre in the area and looking for an affordable, tasty lunch you should give this place a try. They have a special lunch option for sitting at the bar. It may not be as extensive as the full menu, 21pero la cr3dsis illo!  as Cartman would say, Im seriously..., Meh...I went for dinner and was not impressed with the food or cocktails. The decor was very classy but the place was trying too hard. We had the lamb shoulder ragout (best part of the meal...I would rate it a 4 out of 5), crab croquets (straight crab meat inside which was tasty but not amazing...I would rate it 3 out of 5), black kingfish crudo (also a 3 out of 5...the waiter really hyped this up but it just wasnt that good). The cocktail I had was their spin on a Cosmo but it also fell short (it was very sugary). I would not recommend this place even though it is pretty inside., What a classy and fine establishment. I came here with a group of 7 for an end-of-the-year class dinner on a Friday evening. Our server, Christopher I believe, was extremely gracious and kind. He answered all our questions and served our large table very well. Our table shared the crab croquettes ($16), which were very nice, light and not too starchy with plenty of crabmeat inside, but they only came with 4 pieces; a 5 meat & cheese platter ($26) which had a great selection and the bread was very nice.I personally had the Monkfish Osso Buco ($28) and it was cooked well, but a smaller piece of fish. Overall, I enjoyed the plate but I thought the fish couldve been tastier. It seemed it was just pan fried nicely, but thats all. Our table was very happy with our meals though and agreed that we would definitely come back!! There was also this very fancy smaller inner room with paintings on the wall and a beautiful chandelier (I really wanted to go in).P.S. The Happy Hour oyster prices are for the bar only but damn at $1 per oyster. YUM., I had the Seafood Salad Louie, which was three pieces of bib lettuce with a fair amount of scallops and shrimp. Good service and a great place for a business lunch. The seafood is very fresh., We have been for dinner several times. We love this place! I highly recommend the beef carpaccio - the best we have ever had! Also try the whipped ricotta, lobster roll, and oysters, of course. Great place for a delicious meal with friends. Also good for a large group that is mostly focused on drinks. They have a spacious bar with plenty of room for larger groups. Thanks for the great service, Jill!, Great brunch. The french toast was perfect. Ryan, the manager on duty, was very thoughtful and checked in on us regularly. Mark Slater did it again creating a brilliant wine list. Great value., Went before theater with friends. We are admittedly food snobs. Service excellent with our waiter Christopher Spillman. Appetizers very tasty and good portions. Loved the foie gras mouse and octopus. Dinner selections well done. My friend avoids meat and loved the vegetable hot pot. Hit of the night was the bread pudding dessert. Wine selection and Cocktails top off the meal. Highly recommend you try them. We will go back, Went here for brunch and it was fantastic. They have a bottomless mix your own mimosas and bloody Marys with a large selection of toppings. To start, we were served fresh hot cinnamon sugar donuts. We ordered the crab croquets and ricotta cheese appetizers both were delicious. I had the steak and eggs which I highly recommend. Overall, brunch at Pennsylvania 6 was excellent and i recommend it!, Its called Pennsylvania 6 because they have 6 different oysters. That said, come here if you want bomb-ass oysters. I dont know about the rest of the menu, but oysters here were delicious. Bartenders are so nice. Service here is one of the best Ive experienced (main reason why this place deserves 5 stars). During the weekends, youll see an older crowd (and more empty seats). I personally prefer the west side oysters because theyre sweet. East side oysters are salty. I also had the bordeaux dessert wine and it was splendid. Two glasses and it sent me to my happy place (lol)., Wonderful dinner for our 1st night in Washington DC. Great cocktails, menu and service. Jill made us feel very welcome and provided nice recommendations. Loved the oysters, tuna tartare and lobster roll with duck fat fries. Caesar salad was delicious. My daughter had the clams and bucatini which she thoroughly enjoyed. Smoky with the chorizo- yum! Jill brewed a fresh batch of decaf which I always appreciate. Atmosphere is clean and fresh with a bistro feel. I would definitely come back. Thank you for a great 1st night!, Pennsylvania 6 was booked marked for a while and seemed like the perfect place for Mothers Day. I made reservation back in April just to ensure I had my plans locked in. Well this morning started off on the wrong foot and I had to call and cancel my rezs an hour before I was suppose to be there. The gentleman that took the call said that he was sorry I had to cancel and he hoped that things would be ok and hopefully we would be able to visit at a later date. I was feeling pretty bummed because I thought my Mothers outing had been ruined but a blessing showed up temporarily fixing the issue so I was able to go out. I called Penn 6 back to see if they had any openings as I was now able to come in. Ryan informed me that they were all booked up but that he would work something out for me if I just came on in. Since I was coming from Baltimore he said hed see us in about 45mins to an 1hr, so around 12:30 ( I arrived at 12:30 on the dot). When I was a couple blocks away I called to ask about parking, Ryan took the time to try and guide me into a couple garages( most garages are closed in DC on Sundays). I lucked up and found st parking across from the restaurant(my lucky day). When we walked in Ryan greeted us and told us that he was happy that things worked out. Later Ryan came over to make sure that everything was ok service and food wise and to check on my mom because he knew she was feeling a little down from this morning ( he was really sweet). Pearson (the GM) came over to our table as well. He informed us that Ryan had shared with him our rough start this morning and he just wanted to thank us for coming in and make sure that we had the best time there because my mom deserved it. Our waitress Lauren D. did exactly that. She provided superb service and kept the champagne coming. Everything was just great!! We gave hugs on the way out and informed them that we cant wait to come back., This review is for the Mothers Day Brunch. It was fantastic! You were able to select an entree and have access to the entire buffet, which was so.much.food. From the raw bar to the desserts selection, everything I tried was delicious. Our server was very attentive and made sure he put the entrees in at the right time after we were done with the buffet. The sommelier was great also, helping us pick out a nice white wine to go with our entree selections. I will definitely revisit for brunch and/or dinner. The only critique I have is to add food labels to the buffet selections so we know what we are picking out to eat., Amazing food!!! The ricotta and fig jam was one of the best things I have ever had! Oysters were awesome, Lobster Roll was soooo good! I also had the pork-chop which was legitimately the best I have ever had!, Outstanding service (thank you Chris and Tim), delicious oysters and bites (grilled octopus), beautiful, cozy, classy decor, and wonderful cocktails. Did I mention the service?! Very well done...will definitely be back!, A friend and I went to Pennsylvania 6 for their happy hour, and overall, it a very nice space with an upscale vibe and good oysters.Hadn really heard of this place before my friend mentioned, but we decided to go to the happy hour instead of brunch. This is a downtown spot, so I can imagine it would be very packed for brunch, but I don know.The space itself is very nice. A wraparound bar that is very large and plenty of room for people to stand up. Very good for after dinner drinks, which is I sure what they were going for.They have $1 Chesapeake oysters during happy hour, but no drink specials. The bartender said their drinks were already low-priced - but all the cocktails were $12. Perhaps I would drop that selling point...The oysters were very good. Quality oysters, and they have a bunch of other oysters that are not on special for $2.50 and $3.50.Service was very friendly. I think they make it a point here for the bartenders to get to know the customers, because people seem to know each other here. The bartender shook our hands and introduced us to other bartenders. Not a bad tactic to earn your customers downtown.Overall, Pennsylvania 6 is a good spot for happy hour, and the food I saw other people ordering looked good., My husband and I celebrated a wedding anniversary here tonight and Jill was an excellent server. The meal was fantastic and Sam, the sommelier, recommended a nice Riesling for our meal. The manager was very friendly, and the restaurant and restrooms were very clean. We could not have imagined a better ending to our day long celebration. We will return again, and I recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a classy place to relax and enjoy a moment in this busy or hectic world., The best lunch deal in DC. For 10 bucks you get a half sandwich and salad that are simply delicious. The menu offered thee sandwiches and three salads to choose from. I had the pulled roasted chicken and market salad. Yummy and filling. Service was great and food delivered fast., Oysters! Octopus! Sancerre! Done...great service from Julia. The apple dessert thing- amazing., We only went for dessert and drinks, and the dessert (spiced apple cake with bourbon ice cream) was really good. The low stars is for the service. We waited about 20 minutes for our dessert, and it still came before our drinks. We had to ask two other waiters if they knew if our drinks were ever coming and our waitress pretty much avoided us the whole time. The place was not busy either so Im not sure what the hold up was for
54|pineapple-and-pearls-washington|Update on 2/12:Went there first thing in the morning on their first day of opening. I going to lower the rating to four stars.Pros:-Great design of the store (check out their sexy Slayer espresso machine)-The most friendly baristas on earth (duh, it Chef Silverman cafe!)-The Pineapple and Pearls roll is delicious. I totally go back for it, and many other items I haven hadCons:-The coffee is good, but not as great as I expected. Acidity is on the higher end. This might be subject to personal taste.-The line is moving kind of slow, but I willing to give them more time to familiarize the whole operation=========================So ready for their opening tomorrow! Will be back for more details once Ie tried their coffee and baked goods. I always a fan of the Rose Luxury. So I hope Pineapple can live up to the hype!, Super happy they are finally open! The buns were all delicious, but the real winner for me was the shortbread. It is perfectly balanced, with a lovely texture.The espresso was really good, and that Slayer is out of this world. Big props to the person responsible for the interior design, it is simply gorgeous. Its a small shop, and it was full this morning- Im hopeful theyll figure out a few ways to streamline service, but everything was served with the signature Roses happiness, which is contagious and makes waiting no big deal at all., I just ate both the falafel and chicken sandwich.Falafel - pretty good for a pre made falafel sandwich. It tasted and felt fresh with a lively cabbage slaw. The pita came apart, but Im glad it was soft.Chicken - I overhead a lady bring it back because her mother thought it was underdone. The chef explained it was smoked, which means it retains a more pink color. I got mine and she was right. The sandwich was interesting, although the brioche is fluffy so I was disappointed with the amount of chicken . Also, I found the meat rather tough.I will eat the buns in an hour and update the review. At the moment.. If you want a falafel sandwich, go to Amsterdam Falafel and if you want another one go to Taylor or Bub & Pops.Best of luck!, Barracks Row is slowly turning into Luxury Row, and I couldnt be more excited.Awesome first experience this morning on their opening day! I am glad they opened despite that the entire place is not completely ready. The front of the restaurant serves as a coffee shop and is beautifully decorated. I felt pretty fancy and chic just standing inside. They offer many different coffee drinks, I went for the chai latte which was definitely the best chai latte I have ever had!! The coffee drinks are expensive, so it would be tough to make this your everyday coffee shop...but it is perfect for a special occasion.I also ordered the egg hash and salsa sandwich, and was very impressed. I believe the eggs were baked, so the sandwich is super thick and very filling. I have never had an egg sandwich like this, and love the creativity. The sandwich came packed in a pretty package inside a high end black bag adorned with a gold pineapple design- fancy shmancy. For the time being there are no tables here yet. I am looking forward to being able to dine in here. They will eventually serve dinner as well, I am not sure where people will find room to stand in line while everyone starts lining up next door at 4:30! Looking forward to the owners of Roses Luxury to takeover the rest of barracks (luxury) row., This place is delicious. Go before the lines get crazy. They have three homemade nut milks for your coffee (pistachio, hazelnut, macadamia) and a great chai latte. At most small coffee shops, the chai is an afterthought. This one was wonderful- best one Ive had in months, and not overly sweet. I tried all of the sweet buns. My favorite was the chocolate, unsurprisingly for me... The savory sweet bun was also a pleasant surprise. However, my FAVORITE thing was the simple lemon thyme shortbread. Next to all of those beautiful sticky buns, it looked so humble. I almost didnt get one. Thank goodness I did. It had a great mixture of savory, salty, and sweet flavors., Wow! The coffee is just plain phenomenal. Not only is the machine beautiful to look at, its putting out some of the best coffee Ive ever had, hands down. The menu is limited as they are not fully open yet but everything we tried was fantastic. From the rolls to the falafel sandwich, the flavors were delicate and each bite packed a punch. (Dont miss the pineapple by the way.) Service and aesthetic, just like their sister next door the ever popular Roses Luxury, is top notch. The interiors make you want to linger (even though there is no seating just yet). Even the details like the cups, sandwich boxes and bags for carry out, make you feel like youre in a boutique. Everything is so well thought out. I couldnt be more thrilled that Pineapple and Pearls is finally open! My new happy place., Loved the coffee. Yaay to pistachio milk.Loved the service. The whole team is awsome.Loved the falafel sandwich. The chicken sandwich I wish had thinly sliced chicken. Too hard to chew. The egg sandwich had that tamale corn after taste which all three of us didnt like. The fried peppers are a new cult favorite. You really buy the sandwich for the condiment.The swirly buns were too doughy. Would have loved to see an option with crunch (i.e. nuts), Luxury CafeThis place makes me feel like I left DC and ended up in Europe. It has a great French vibe and luxurious decor. From the floor tile to the coffee machine, I am impressed with the details! I LOVE the paper cup with the gold detail.Sweet TreatsHad the pineapple and pearl roll as well as the cinnamon roll. If you are looking to satisfy your sweet tooth craving - you have hit gold. The pineapple one has a subtle pineapple tang that is not too overpowering and the cinnamon roll tastes as you would expect - sweet and cinnamon-y.Grab and Go:Heads up - currently this spot has no seating area so you can only come in, order and then leave. Wish for:As they just opened, I do hope there will be some seating area in the future (maybe outside?) Would love to sip on some delicious beverage and eat a sweet treat., Ok Ive been twice and have some concrete opinions!!: Hazelnut, Pistachio, & Macadamia nut home made milks = amazing.The pistachio & macadamia (personally) taste the smoothest when mixed into their homemade chai or lattes. The hazelnut is defiantly a stronger more pronounced taste & wasnt my fav.Shortbread cookie & spicy chocolate roll 100% on point !!! Egg sandwich w/ side of chili oil has explosive flavor worthy of its roses luxury affiliation, it was 95% perfection, only downside is if you dont eat it fast enough the bread gets a little soggy. The presentation is insane; custom made bags, cups, sandwich boxes, seriously add a major luxury feel to it!! & last but not least, customer service is on point & lovely (as to be expected!) other business on the block ( looking at you souk & spring mill, beware..!!), My favorite part of the visit was their take out packaging. I a sucker for quality packaging. Theirs is killer. I had a pineapple muffin. It was ok/borderline good. Good flavors but I wish it had been warm. For a signature treat, I really was hoping to find something that made me say Damn! in a good way. It didn. What really upset me and soured me on the visit was the egg hash sandwich. After ordering, we had to wait 15 minutes to get our order. The place was not busy. We were the only 2 people there around noon on a Friday. The sandwich was pre made which I fine with. But if youe going to serve me a pre made sandwich AND make me wait for it, for the love of god please don let it be cold. It was super cold. Barely ate any of it. Also, I not sure what type of mayo it was smothered in but it could surely have done with less. As a lover of breakfast sandwiches, I was really disappointed. Won be going back anytime soon., Before you pick up your lap top bag and head over to Barracks Row hottest, newest coffee shop, just know that Pineapple & Pearls is a walk up coffee shop meaning there is absolutely NO seating and therefore no public wifi. If you know that going in, youl have right expectations and will most likely LOVE this place.As DC continues to New Yorkify (Thanks to Maketto for starting that movement), it only seems appropriate for Pineapple a& Pearls to open. It a small coffee shop/pastry walk in from, by, and right next door to Rose Luxury. It simple and chic like New York City using a neo-modern beach theme. It reminiscent of high class Charleston. The two staff members behind the white marble counter are friendly and they may ask you if youe been in before, but not in a way that a question. They ask it as if you for sure have been in before, but you haven. Psychologically that makes you feel more connected to them as if they think youe familiar. It gives you a real sense that you are in fact invited and welcomed at Pineapple & Pearls. Even as a student of psychology, I fell for it and am already planning on my next visit. They sell quality, artisan coffee as the Peregrine-esque menu boards tells you. However, unlike nearby Peregrine, Pineapple & Pearls sells chai latte and a darn good one at that. They also sell 6 pastries most of which are of the cinnamon roll variety. If you like chocolate and a little kick in the morning, order the Mexican chocolate cinnamon roll. It will come out from the oven warm oozing with Mexican chocolate. Theyl give it to you in a clean, white bag, but ask for napkins....LOTS of them. Youl need it to wipe off the warm Mexican chocolate from your lips, chin, and in my case my eyebrow (I still don know how that happened).Pineapple & Pearls- Welcome to DC. I wouldn be surprised if you get named Best New Coffee Shop in the USA. After all, you are the child of Rose Luxury. Way to live up to the expectation and hype! Now I need to go continue wiping that Mexican chocolate from my brow.UPDATE: I returned to Pineapple & Pearls after I read they have one of the best chicken sandwiches in DC. As a Chick-fil-A fan, I had to go. I went on Saturday at 2PM and there was a little wait, but worth it. Their take on a spicy chicken sandwich is perfection. It comes on quality bread, a perfect looking piece of lettuce, perfectly crispy chicken, and homemade pickles. They then add their secret sauce, which make it a combo of southern, Indian, and Asian spices. It AMAZING and decently priced at $9. It comes in a fancy white box too!, Come one, come all, ye hipsters, third wave coffee lovers, Bon Appetit reading tourist hoards. A new place by Aaron Silverman of Roses Luxury is open and you probably wont need to line up to eat there. Hooray! Pineapple & Pearls is right next door to Roses Luxury and right now serves as a walk up coffee shop though at some point it will be a companion restaurant to Roses. Apparently when the weather gets nicer they will have seats outside (I think in the back?) but for now its just grab and go. It ticks all the hipster checkboxes for a coffee shop. Beautiful tiled floor? Check. Sandwich shop type moveable text menu on the wall? Check. Colorful contemporary art on the walls? Check. Gold accents on the takeaway bags and cups like a Harry Potter type lightening bolt? Check. Somewhat uninterested hipsters making your coffee? Check. There was a masonry crew doing brickwork outside the store when I went who were more friendly than the staff, opening the door, wishing me a great day. Friendly bunch of bricklayers!I got the chai tea because others had raved about it so much with macadamia milk just because I had never had that before. It was lightyears away from what you would get at Starbucks. Spicy and intense, it was really flavorful. I wasnt as crazy about the macadamia milk but when in a hipster coffee shop you get nut milk. Next time Ill probably just get a regular latte.I also picked up a Mexican chocolate hot bun. WARNING: these are not for first date havers or for parents who have perpetually messy kids. I am pretty careful and I still ended up with chocolate all over my face and hands. It was also spicy and delicious. I seem to have a knack for picking spicy things. My hot bun emerged from the back of the store like a Wizard of Oz character from behind the curtain. It added to the mystery of the whole event. Very fresh!I went on a Friday at 9:30 AM and there was no crowd. I imagine on a nice Saturday or Sunday once it gets written about in a few magazines there will probably be a line out the door. Get in while you can!And before you complain that the place must have been named by an a automatic hipster restaurant naming machine I can only assume that the chef was honoring the American South because pineapples are a symbol of welcome and hospitality in Southern culture and you know that every Southern girl has to have her pearls., Best sandwich and coffee deal in DC by far. Sweet rolls are incredible as well. Extremely #rare flavor and vibes by the most talented people behind a stove/espresso machine. Even the bags are beautiful. I expect it to be a daily staple to my diet!, Very tiny coffee shop next to Roses Luxury. Street meter parking available! While we were waiting in line for Roses to open, a few of us went inside Pineapple & Pearls to warm up/grab a cup of coffee. Because it is really tight inside, we pretty much had to grab our coffee and come back outside again. Very clean, simple and modern interior. Their restroom is really nice and clean haha. Their latte was strong yet delicious, perfect! Everything seemed to be reasonably priced. Service was friendly and quick! I would go back if I were in the area again., DELICIOUS! Pineapple and Pearls is the new cafe affiliated with (and right next to) Roses Luxury in Barracks Row (Eastern Market / Capitol Hill). Such an awesome concept! They serve up a very simplistic menu of buns, sandwiches, and coffee drinks. I ordered the brisket bun (was savory and came with a horseradish dipping sauce) and the pineapple and pearls bun (sweet). So delicious!! For now, its simply a carryout only type place (you walk up, order, and get your food and walk out) and there isnt much space inside or any tables (I suppose you could stand inside, if its not a crowded day and you dont mind standing). But I have heard that in April, they will open up an exclusive reservation-only space to supplement the business that Roses Luxury gets. Id definitely be interested in checking that out! For now, the cafe gets 5 big stars from me!, This coffee, sweet roll, and sandwich bar is just a walk up shop with a few bar stools in the window. There is little to no signage out front, but it is a place you should definitely check out. Hubby and I went on a Saturday morning and although it was pretty packed waited only about 15 minutes total from walking in to leaving with our food. The service and experience was consistent with what I would expect from Roses- very friendly, informative, and accommodating. I had the egg hash sandwich which I felt was a great value at $7.5- a huge sandwich and very filling with potatoes, eggs, peppers, and some sort of vinegary vegetable goodness. It was served to me room temp and actually a bit chilled in some places which Im not sure was intentional. I would have preferred it hot. My husband got the spicy fried chicken sandwich and devoured it. I couldnt even snag a taste. I had a dirty chai latte after reading reviews of how great their chai was. It was very tasty- spicy and not sweet at all like so many other places serve it. The last few sips were a bit grainy- maybe from espresso grounds or the tea- not very pleasant. We topped off our lunch with a pineapple and pearls roll-you must taste this. The roll was much heavier and more substantial than most sweet rolls. It definitely will be the thing I return for, I cant wait to try the others! I wanted this to be a 5 star place- the service and beautiful packaging certainly was, but I was a tad disappointed in the luke-warm sandwich and grainy finish on the drink. I will definitely return and give it another try, mostly to check out the other favors of sweet rolls!!, I have nothing to add to what everyone else has said about the coffee. The espresso is absolutely fantastic and the pistachio milk made the latte different and delicious.I think they have been paying attention to the various reviews though, because when I went in yesterday the grilled chicken sandwich was no more. Instead, now they have a spicy fried chicken sandwich. From the menu description (spicy fired chicken, homemade pickles, house sauce) I was expecting something more Southern. It is called Pineapple & Pearls, after all. The actual sandwich was maybe 60% Southern, 40% Asian. The fried chicken is spot on with a really light, not greasy batter, and the pickles are great, all top notch Southern fare. What was unexpected (but still delicious) was that the spicy from the sandwich comes from the Asian chile-style sauce, and the bread was fluffy and sweet, almost like a (really good) King Hawaiian roll. And by spicy, they mean SPICY. I am the type of person that adds a tablespoon or two of sriracha to my food on the regular, and this sandwich had my eyes watering and my nose running. I like that sort of thing, but beware if you usually walk on the milder side., This is a very small unassuming shop. There is no seating. Strictly a neighborhood joint where you can pick up a sandwich, a bun and coffee to go. There coffee is excellent. I was very impressed with the sweets. The lemon-thyme shortbread is very elegant. It is truly the unsung hero next to their lineup of buns. The cinnamon bun was my next favorite. The Mexican hot chocolate was interesting. It had some kick that my taste buds wasnt attuned with. It is very clear to me that everything was of the highest quality here and that includes their service!, Yum! Despite the limited seating and prices ($4.25 for a tiny latte); the coffee and cinnamon rolls are delicious and a worthy treat. I cant wait to go back and try the sandwiches - the spicy fried chicken sounds amazing. They are all about d39cor with hot pink accents and gold brushed coffee cups. Its very charming. Ill be excited when the restaurant opens as well!, a yo... the spicy fried chicken sammich is on point! i came strictly for this and it definitely didn disappoint. love the fact that they use dark meat. got the cinnamon roll, the brisket roll, the pineapple and pearls, and mexican hot chocolate to go. my favs were the pineapple and pearls as well as the mexican hot chocolate. side note, i was kind of worried when i read a review stating that the sammich was really spicy... then i glanced over and saw her profile pic (a white person). haha, no offense, but you know white folks... they think tap water is spicy. is that racist? HAHAHAalso, i talked about the hefty price tag for their fine dining. dude behind the counter was like, it isn that expensive compared to other spots. bruh, $250 a head. that a grand for 4 people., I am in love with Pineapple & Pearls spicy fried chicken sandwich. Their menu is small but I want to try everything. Although run by the same people as Roses Luxury, I much prefer P&P. The flavors just worked, so well. Wouldnt be surprised if they are awarded a michelin star in the fall, if the restaurant part is as on point as the cafe!, The cafe at Pineapple & Pearls is a great addition to Barracks Row. BR lacks quick breakfast and lunch options, and on those criteria, the Pineapple & Pearls cafe does not disappoint. They have three main menu items: An egg hash sandwich, Fried chicken sandwich, and Falafel sandwich. Otherwise, they have a variety of buns, which looked great, but I was craving something more substantive. I went for the egg hash. Its an interesting and pretty delicious sandwich. I dont love eggs in scrambled/omelet form (Im an over medium girl), but the hash contained potatoes, peppers, and other goodies. The bread was light and fluffy, and they provide some crispy chilies on the side which I recommend putting inside of the sandwich. And the ice coffee is delish., Incredible experience. A must in DC!I went a few weeks ago with my husband and two friends of ours. We love Roses and were so excited to try this place out. The food was amazing and its a set menu, so youll be getting whatever is in season at that point. I should point out that they were incredibly accommodating of our dietary restrictions, and since they know in advance whos coming in to the restaurant, they can actually tailor the seasonal menu to fit the needs of their guests. For example, my husband doesnt eat seafood or pork, and there was only one dish that they needed to modify for him. The reservation system is unique in that you purchase tickets for the day and time that you want. You pay half the cost of the ticket upfront and half on the day of the reservation. Since the menu is changing, Ill focus on a few things that stood out to me. You really feel like youre sitting in your kitchen (a beautiful, streamlined kitchen) and youve got a chef that is cooking food just for you. The waiters are barely noticeable. The service is nearly seamless. I will say, though, that when we went it felt like the waiters were still trying to figure out how formal to be. Roses is very low-key and friendly. P&P is trying for a level above that, but its also not black tie formal. Non-alcoholic pairings. I wish they offered a lower priced meal for those who are not drinking. I went with the non-alcoholic pairings and some of the drinks were interesting, but it didnt seem quite worth the price in comparison to the liquor that the others at my table were getting. The donuts were the low part of the meal. They were a series of liquor inspired donuts that were lauded as the big finale, and they really fell short. The shortbread and the coffee that we went home with were quite good though. Overall though a wonderful treat that celebrated the arrival of a new addition to our family and a new address., After falling in love with sister venue Roses Luxury during a visit to Washington DC last fall, our meal at Pineapple & Pearls was a focal point of this vacation. Generally not a fan of pre-paid tickets to restaurants, this was a rare exception where I gladly ponied up the $250 deposit weeks in advance. Having dined at the more casual Roses Luxury I knew the chef had the talent to make the meal worthwhile, as well as the popularity to otherwise make dining here a challenge (at Roses there is a no reservation policy and people often start lining up well over an hour prior the restaurant opening to secure a table). While the cuisine at Pineapple and Pearls is certainly more upscale than Roses, what I was really happy about was the vibe is still very relaxed and friendly, yet not so casual as to lose the ambiance of a fancy meal. The dining room is intimate, extremely comfortable and beautifully decorated. So much attention to detail was made to the restaurant design as well as the stunning serving pieces. We enjoyed approximately 14 courses, initially a series of one biters followed by more substantial fare with the final savory consisting of a smokey, delicious rib of beef (we gladly jumped at the offer of seconds). Absolutely no duds and several of the courses were so amazing we longed for more (we half jokingly contemplated calling the restaurant the next evening to see if there was anyway they could sneak us in for a repeat experience). Unlike some extended tasting menus, there was no let down with desserts. Presentations are beautiful, artistic with occasional whimsy (i.e. a play on mixing a Wendys frosty with French fries), but all without coming across as gimmicky or pretentious. The total portion of food was just right for me, but if one has a particularly large appetite I could see leaving a tad hungry. Pacing was perfect as well, definitely a leisurely dining experience (we were there just over three hours), but such a pleasant environment to be in it did not seem too lengthy and there were no big gaps between courses. The beverage pairings were spot on (nine total drinks, four wines with a couple of beers and cocktails mixed in for good measure and coffee at the end). Pours of the wine were fairly generous and we were topped off when we finished our glass too early (hard not to do with some of the wines; there were some real gems). The only confusing factor was some pairings were only meant for one course, whereas others for a few courses - it would have been nice to have been told when served how many courses the beverage was meant to last. Like at Roses, service at Pineapple & Pearls is extremely friendly. Such a wonderful group of people working at both venues. The perfect mix of being personable yet polished. Staff seemed genuinely enthusiastic about being there and really enhanced the dining experience. There was only a single faux pas; with advance notice Pineapple & Pearls strives to accommodate dietary restrictions and aversions. At the onset of the meal they confirmed my wifes aversion to honey and commented that they would be delivering her something special in lieu of one of the desserts that contained honey, but this was forgotten. This was more than made up for later; my wife had mentioned regretting not having ordered the brisket at our last meal at Roses and at the end of our meal they surprised us with a nicely packaged brisket sandwich to enjoy later at our hotel. That is truly service at its best.I strongly recommend securing seats at the chefs counter as this makes the experience even more special. So much fun sitting on the other side of the kitchen, watching the chefs work their magic. Like the front-of-the-house, the chefs themselves were all super friendly, willing to answer questions and engage in banter - even the Executive Chef/Owner Aaron Silverman was so down to earth. All said and done, this was definitely among my better meals this year and just a fantastic across the board dining experience. While not inexpensive, considering what is included it is actually a fairly good value. Just days before our meal, news broke that Michelin had started covering Washington DC and would be releasing their first guide this fall. With nearly every course flawlessly executed, a high percentage of courses incredibly delicious and lots of creativity, I think Pineapple & Pearls has a strong chance to debut at 2* (no small feat for a new venue). The only possible limiting factor is most 2*s Ive frequented feature a larger quantity of luxurious ingredients; IMHO this did not impact the quality of my meal and Pineapple & Pearls is priced less expensive than most 2* restaurants. Please note that Pineapple & Pearls during the day time operates as a casual, inexpensive coffee shop; since the daytime and nighttime experience is so different, IMHO Yelp should separate this venue into two distinct listings., From the first step in the door, this place will transport you like no other restaurant can. You begin with a small tasty welcoming cocktail before being swept past a calming bar area where happy guests have already started their journey, and away into a magical open-kitchen dining room. There is another bar area in front of the kitchen where these diners have a front row seat into the creation of over 17 courses.We had a comfy corner banquette table and started with a great Champagne in the most beautiful Zalto stemware Ive ever seen. Forget about Reidel, We start with three finger food snacks which are far from snack food, but mouthsize morsels of heaven. I cant even describe each of the courses, as each one has a combination of flavors, sauces, greens, melted cheeses that can only be experienced. This continues for nearly 3 hours. Unlike other multiple course dining experiences, the time flies in this one. The courses come quick enough that it keeps your interest and tastebuds on point. You will not walk away hungry, but also not bloated. The creations are perfectly sized, and build on each other perfectly. You never want it to end, and you leave the restaurant energized with a parting schwag bag! The course offerings will continually change, so if I win the lottery, I would come here one night a week for the rest of my life, and would wake up every day waiting for that night!, I seriously need Yelp to add one more star just once so I can give this the only 6 star review. Ill break this review down by different aspects of the experience.Service: Impeccable. The staff was welcoming, engaging, friendly, while being incredibly professional yet down to earth and sincere. They somehow achieved this without being overbearing all at the same time. If only they could train every other restaurant (or comcast for that matter!) in the area on this type of amazing customer service then life would be so much more pleasant!Atmosphere: We sat at the Chefs Counter and despite being right by the kitchen the noise level was still fine and didnt require us to raise our voices to talk to each other. It was awesome to see the dishes form right in front of us! The decor was classy and modern without feeling stuffy and the lighting levels were perfect, not so dark that you couldnt see, but not so bright that you didnt know it was night.Drinks: We were greeted at the door with our choice of either a bourbon cocktail with a chocolate gold flaked cherry or Prosecco with a blackberry. While we waited for our seats to be ready for us, I finished my cocktail and was promptly asked if Id like another one, quickly realizing that this theme would probably continue through the night, I declined because I wanted to pace myself. The next cocktail/snack was the amazing Fennel & Absinthe bonbon that is pictured in other reviews. The drinks that followed through the night included: Blanc de Blanc Champagne, white Burgundy (chardonnay), a Rose made with the holy trinity of grapes (Grenache, Syrah, Mourvedre), a Japanese belgian style beer, a Saint Bernardus Abbey ale, a Spanish red (Rioja), and a Scotch cocktail with dessert. All of the pairings were spot on and enhanced the flavors of the drinks and the food.Food: I dont know how to describe it, so I wont. Every dish had so much thought and perfect execution. Each dish made you surprised about something, whether it be a flavor combination, or just that mouthgasm you get when all the ingredients are in perfect balance. Absolutely incredible. Even if all the other parts of this restaurant were terrible, I would still go back like a fat kid willing to be abused just for another scoop of icecream.Price: Totally worth every penny of the $250 a person price tag considering tax tip booze food, and the amazing mini donuts, shortbread and flash brew coffee goody bag for the next morning (which of course were freaking amazing and reminded me to write this review).Again, 6 out 5 stars. I sincerely hope this restaurant gets the Michelin stars it clearly deserves come October 13th, even though it will inevitably be even harder to get a reservation. Go while you can!, Dropped in just to check out the lunch offerings because there miraculously happened to be parking available on 8th Street. As a huge fan of Roses, I expected good things, but was unprepared for the absolutely delicious, amazing and addictive spicy chicken sandwich! Im a southerner and am a fan of fried chicken in just about any form. This sandwich is insane- a huge thigh with all the crunchy, crispy edges and chunks youd ever want- spiced to perfection and set off by housemade herb pickles and a lovely spicy sauce that brings just the right amount of heat. The butter lettuce and soft yeast roll are also exactly right for this little bomb of deliciousness. Im a fan- and this is one Ill be back for again and again!, I really wanted to not like this place because it was so expensive, but it was worth every penny. My review is late, I cam on opening week and the food we had was divine. I felt like I was a VIP at the restaurant and you are relayed treated as an individual. My boyfriend and I chose to sit at the bar because neither of us drink. The only way that our experience would have been better is when you walk in the front, they offer you cocktails, I wish that they had a non alcoholic option to try. Though they offered to make us one after we said we didnt drink, it was still a little awkward. Anyway the food, to die for. The bone marrow dish was a highlight for me and there was an entry to the dessert where we got to blow smoke in each others faces from the flavored ice that we had. Eating here is an experience not just dinner. If you dont really want to pay the full price, go to bar seating, I think thats the trick. Assume that your dinner will be about 3 hours, but it will be the shortest 3 hours ever. After the meal, I felt perfect, not too full....except I could have had a few more of those bone marrow., Hands down- best restaurant in DC. This place should be Michelin rated and I honestly cannot stop raving about it. The reservation system is actually really easy to use and Im actually so thankful its so organized. I think its like a month in advance that u are able to book but honestly thats fine. Its all online and super organized.We decided to get the 12 course meal without wine pairing at the bar. PHENOMENAL. They started with one bite wonders including this amazing asparagus with dressings. The texture was just enough salt and sweet and we wish we could have more. Then the avocado fritter which Im ironically not a raver of avocado and neither was my dining partner but it was so warm and sweet...amazing. Then followed the potato ice cream with caviar. I licked the bowl clean.Next were the noodles with sea urchin. So fragrant. The egg drop soup with Parmesan was so creative. Great presentation. The fluke with sliced grapes...amazing texture and perfect taste.However I have to rave about the desserts. You can never go wrong with the chocolate souffle. And the white strawberry shortcake was probably the best dessert Ive ever had before in my life! With white strawberries from Belgium!I cant wait to go back to this place! I cant wait to see what they whip up next., Not quite perfect in any category but extremely enjoyable and a good value in my opinion. Five stars relative to peers in the DMV with room to improve. Looking forward to experiencing this restaurant grow.House, pease consider: soup as shooter, chopsticks, washcloth before finger foods, meat!, Now wee talking...While I could take or leave Rose Luxury, we really enjoyed Pineapple and Pearls. Excellent service and reservation format - they truly make you feel welcomed and get you primed for an awesome experience. My girlfriend and I weren sure whether we would go with the drink pairings or not, so we grabbed bar seating since there was no additional charge for the pairings at the bar. Sure enough, we ended up ordering the pairings anyway - non-alcoholic for her. The wine pairing is quite nice, and if you finish your glass a bit too fast they will refill your glass to enjoy the next course as intended.The first set of courses come fast and furious as our server stated, and as the courses get larger then the pace slows down. Very nicely timed and very enjoyable. Some of my standout dishes were the roasted potato ice cream with osetra caviar (of course), matcha soba with snap pea and sea urchin, fluke veronique, the SWEETBREAD STUFFED CHICKEN WING OMGGG (dip it in the fish sauce), and of course the mole smoked beef rib. The strawberry shortcake and chocolate souffle dishes also were excellent, and they send you home with some donuts. This was the place to truly enjoy Aaron Silverman cooking...He really lets loose and has a lot up his sleeves - I can wait for the training wheels to come off. This was the experience I was looking for, but didn find with Rose., (This is a lunch review - heres hoping a review of dinner is in our near future.)1 - great staff! Just plain ole friendly, knowledgable folks whore enjoying what theyre doing. both here and at Roses, they understand service (and not the stuffy, fuddy-duddy kind either).2 - the fried chicken sandwich! the fried chicken sandwich! the fried chicken sandwich!3 - the vietnamese iced coffee.4 - the pineapple and cinnamon rolls were OK IMHO, but the Mexican hot chocolate roll was spot on. rich dark chocolate with a kick of heat at the end., Amazing meal. It was worth every penny and all the hassle to get a table., 5++++++. This rating is off the charts & there is a new leader on my Favorite Restaurant in DC list. Holy moly. From the time you enter the door, the service is impeccable. The hostesses are exceptionally nice, they ask for any dietary restrictions, say Happy Birthday (if applicable;)) and then they start you off with a very welcome Welcome Drink. From there, your server for the night takes your drinks and escorts you to your table, pointing out the restrooms on the way.Then theres the food. Omg, I could go on and on through each course, but really there isnt much to say other than they were all phenomenal. From the first course of a one-bite bon bon, to the final dessert. Every dish is small but packs SO much flavor in a single bite. Its insane. The techniques are on another level.Continuing with the service, not once were we rushed through a course, and every single member of the service staff knew the dishes inside out. The timing of the 14 courses was perfect. And at the end, since its pre paid, you simply get up and leave, no messing around with cards, receipts, tips, or signatures, allowing you to savor the meal even longer as you leave the table.As if that wasnt enough, they give you a goodie bag with some little treats in them to take home.I just cannot say enough great things about this place. This was probably the best dining experience Ive ever had., My girlfriend brought me here for my birthday. With so much hype around another Mini Bar-esque type of restaurant coming to DC, we were both absolutely thrilled to be able to get reservations here and try this place out. I say Mini-Bar-esque because when a restaurant is competing for a Michelin star and asks it guests to pay a very hefty price tag per person, there isn much else to compare it to in our city. Couple that with an unsaid promise - hey, price is supposed to equate to quality, right? - of one of the best meals ever, you shouldn leave the restaurant regretting your experience, especially if youe there celebrating a special occasion.Unfortunately, the food did not meet the wildly high expectations. Perhaps the place just wasn for me or maybe this was an off night since I was told the chefs experiment often and the menu changes week to week. But, nearly every dish we were served didn have us wishing for more. Of the 13 dishes we were served, we did not finish 3 of them (these are small plates).The meal started off promising. The fennel and absinthe bonbon melted in our mouths, the baby elotes were delicious and the asparagus, pineapple and Edwards ham were great. However, beyond these three dishes, something just didn seem right. The sweetbread stuffed chicken wing seemed to be undercooked and we did not finish the portion. The green garlic egg drop soup was very sour and also a dish that we did not finish. The finishing coffee (also did not finish) was entirely too bitter. While everyone pallet towards coffee is different, the coffee tasted almost burnt!Again, I like to say that this was a truly one off experience given the flawless reviews I see here. The service was also beyond 5 star and the staff was superbly nice. But beyond this, the food did not live up to the expectation or the lofty price point that should live up to it. Sadly, We will not be returning., Four and a half stars. Set that calendar reminder to reserve the date you want as soon as possible. Yes, the alcoholic beverage pairing is worth it, so you might as well shoot for chefs counter since it has a better view than the equally priced table rezzies. Wave to the Roses Luxury line next door! We were the first table of the night, giving us a great look into the kitchen for the initial stretch. Dinner was tremendously delicious, we arrived in varying stages of hunger and both left stuffed.Food pacing was good, our table was tended regularly, and our friendly server let us know how long to stretch our beverages for; the few times they thought we were running too low on bottle-pours to pair through the next course, they discreetly splashed a bit more into our glasses. Presentations were finessed to great aesthetic and table-side conversation (each course was explained by various staff members more thoroughly here than at V:T21 or MBbJA).The cocktails we were greeted with were probably my least favorite beverage of the evening: fine, but nothing out of the ordinary. Well-crafted absinthe bonbon and asparagus okonomiyaki were tasty, then promptly upstaged by limp but yummy baby elotes. Jasmine tea hand towels have made it into my DIY spa day plans, thanks! Oysters and vodka were refreshing, leaving our palates cleansed for the rich buns with tart cherries and foie butter (over-salted, so to be on the safe side consider tapping out some of the seasoning garnish and adjust to taste). Adorable fold-out box!Summer garden egg drop soup was a lighter twist on familiar flavors, and followed by my favorite dish of the night-- the fluke, faux grape scales, sorrel, and fumet were incredible, and further elevated by its beverage pairing. Summer red curry was yummy in its concentrated broth, but I wasnt a huge fan of the dual textures of coconut rice. I would have loved a crack at the coconut fragment and prawn heads in the upper chamber of the repurposed Hario Technica coffeemaker... #BreakingBad. Charred fan of enoki mushrooms worked really well. When we pointed out that Matts plate was missing calamari, they apologized and hustled to parboil replacements with the foresight that the already-poured curry would be too cool to finish it at the right temp. Sweetbread stuffed chicken wing came with a chili sauce that I preferred over the lime fish sauce.Blueberry shortcake was my favorite dessert, balanced by the sake and vinegar aperitif. Coffee kakigori was right up my alley, too. As much as I liked the honeycomb ice cream sprinkled with crispy buckwheat, my sweet tooth was aching by the time I finished its accompanying chocolate souffle, and I thought this paired weakest with the quad. Booze-scented donuts to share paired harmoniously with my jasmine tea! The birthday cake was a little forgettable, but I pillaged a second mouthful of the pistachio gelato atop it despite my full tummy. Nothing to sign, so we were free to leave as soon as we were done at the end of our 2h45m meal. Cold-brew and pistachio shortbread cookies in our exit gift bag were respectively a touch bitter and rich on their own, but again balanced wonderfully when consumed together.Bathroom was clean, bobby pins were a nice touch. My biggest criticism is that out of 14 courses, I find it pretty unbalanced to have 4 moderately sized desserts, though to be fair the last course is structured to take home if youre full. If the shaved ice was intended to be an intermission, it was a little too sweet to succeed. Wed still come back for another special occasion during a different season once the menu turns over completely (seems like ~6 menu tweaks/month so far?). Our awesome dinner experience has also encouraged me to return for their daytime cafe goods: Viet iced coffee, Mexican hot chocolate roll, brisket roll, fried chicken sandwich? Gimme., I came for a weekday lunch. There was no line, and you can sit outside of the cafe or next door at Roses. You order at the counter, and the workers bring the food out to you fairly quickly. Everything was excellent; I ordered the fried chicken sandwich and had a pastry. The fried chicken was juicy, and the sweetness of the bread and tangy spice of the Asian-inspired slaw really kept the sandwich nice and light--not at all greasy. The pastry was a cinnamon bun with a Mexican hot chocolate type glaze; it wasnt overly sweet, and was very soft and fluffy. The only problem I have with this place is that the lunch portions were quite small. If I had been hungrier, I think I could have easily downed two of the sandwiches, or I could see some of my larger guy friends eating two. For the price, I would have expected something a little larger--though I guess it was nice that it forced me to pace myself for dessert, hah. (For comparison, I think the brioche bun for the fried chicken sandwich was about the size of a large-ish dinner roll.), Let me start by saying that this was the best meal that Ive had in 12 years of DC dining, jumping ahead of past favorites like Komi, Minibar, and The Inn at Little Washington. Wow.Pineapple and Pearls and me got off to a rocky start. We were supposed to go a month ago but received a phone call while we were en route to let us know that their power went out and that they were closing for the night. Obviously not the restaurants fault and they handled getting us a new time quickly. About an hour before our reservation last night I received a dreaded call from them, this time asking if they could push our reservation back by 30 minutes. Given everything that happened the first time we were supposed to go, I was shocked that they would even call to ask. So, here is where they failed. If you are going during the second seating, you are in the hands of the people at your table before you. The restaurant is so small, there is nothing to be done if a party lingers. We werent seated until 20 minutes after our reservation and there was another group that waited 50 minutes to be seated. You shouldnt have a problem like this at a restaurant of this caliber. They need to find a way to either get the first seating to wrap up or change how long they expect a meal to take. The only other thing I will say here, is that they werent overly apologetic about making us wait so long for our table. I would have expected the manger to stop by to explain what was happening and offer a nice glass of champagne or something.Once we were finally seated things changed for the better. The space is small, inviting, and amazing at the same time. The servers and chefs who step out of the kitchen to tell you about their creations were so professional and friendly and personal. You felt like you were at home. I think that there were 13 courses last night, each well-presented and innovative. A few of our favorites were the baby elotes, black pepper pain au lait, mole smoked beef rib, and blueberry shortcake. The only dish that our table didnt like was the coffee kakigori (there was an intense chicory flavor that we couldnt get past).The drink pairings with the courses were superb and if you finished a little too quickly someone was always willing to fill our glass. This place is truly special. I hope that they work out their scheduling issues and it will be a perfect experience. Try it out. And if you go for the first seating, you wont have the issue that we did., I always read reviews, but never leave one..but I feel its necessary for this spot! In a city full of coffee snobs and equally as snobby baristas, this place is a breath of fresh air. Shout out to the cashier with glasses- you are a little ray of sunshine and the chai latte with hazelnut milk is fantastic. Cant wait to come back for dinner sometime!!, Amazing. You will believe that each dish is the best thing you have ever tried... until the next dish arrives. The drink pairings are on point- wine is excellent. Kim, the pastry chef, has amazing talent and her dishes are phenomenal. Silverman has done it again!, Love the coffee shop. The folks there are so kind and they remember you. Pastries and food are very good-- though I have to say they seem to be tweaking the chicken sandwich (sizing, and some seasonings) constantly. That being said, we are regulars., This is the most Ive ever spent on a meal and it was worth it. It is an experience. Sit at the chefs counter - you get to interact with the chefs that way and who knows maybe Aaron Silverman will serve you too (he served us and was super nice). Also come hungry as its a lot of food. I was hungry and left stuffed. The pacing and the service are excellent. The presentation is amazing!!! You also get additional pours of drinks if your glass is empty during a course because you wouldnt want to be without a drink!!! This is going to sound weird, but as wonderful as the food was I also loved the actual plates - they were so cute and interesting. Im not sure I can say anything about the food that hasnt already been said, but I can see coming back here during a different season when the dishes change. We even got a takehome box with donuts, coffee, and shortbread. The donuts were the just okay. I liked the coffee and shortbread much better., Amazing place.Very small inside.Great service. We came for dinner here, it was a fixed menu. Dinner took us about three hours. Everything was amazing and delicious. Tons of alcohol.Unfortunately one of my friends was still not full after leaving lol. Everyone else got stuffed. So its definitely enough food to get you full. Every course (14 total) was presented in a cool way. Beautiful presentation.The menu that we got, they change menu all the time, had great variety. The only complaint that I have, is that a lot of courses took a little longer to serve than I would have wanted. So we were slowly tortured and starved haha. Also most courses were hella complicated. Ok, I understand, you have to make the price worth it, but I think I would be ok if I dont try a fried and then roasted and then pickled left leg of an orangutan.The point is, food doesnt have to be complicated to be delicious or to be considered fine dining. IMHOYou also get a choice of espresso, any coffee, tea, etc with dessert. I picked some tea that the waitress named. It had a weird name and was still considered tea. Turned out to be decaf black tea, at least it looked like that. And it was the most amazing tea ever. And I know my teas... Get it with honey!!!!!They give you a box of cute mini doughnuts at the end, but they are just ok. And when you are leaving they present you with a baggy with coffee inside and shortcakes. Nice touch lol. It was really cute., Easily the best restaurant Ive ever gone to. From the service, to the food, to the drinks, to the decor. Aaron Silverman has hit a grand slam. Sat at the chefs counter and had the 15 course menu. Wow, wow, wow. This is where you go to enjoy flavors from all over the world with an unbelievable presentation. I cant wait to go back again!, Hands down best meal and overall food experience of my life. Unreal. It was worth every penny. Sitting at the chefs counter is a must- you are completely enthralled in the food experience and the service is excellent. The head chef, Aaron Silverman, prepared our meal right in front of us, and served us as well, with warmth and passion. Every course gets better and better, and each course is a completely different explosion of interesting unique flavors, unlike anything you have ever tasted. I left completely full. The drink pairings were subtle and perfect. The detail in the design of the space was beautiful and carefully curated. The space is small which makes it warm, yet its very elegant and upscale. Highly recommend this experience if you are a food lover and can appreciate the art and preparation that goes into such exceptional combinations. They left you with a goodie bag, including a cold brew and shortbread cookie, which I enjoyed this morning., We made reservations 4 weeks ahead and was charged for 50% off the bat. The other 50% was charged on the day of the reservation.Located right besides Roses luxury I didnt see a sign on the wall or door, but there was a chalkboard on the sidewalk.We were warmly greeted and served welcome drinks like we were in a resort. We were seated at the bar but the the irony was we dont consume alcoholic beverages. The experience was unique in a sense that everyone in that room was eating the same thing just served at different pace. I dont know how to feel about that, I still want to have some control on what I put into my mouth. I knew that the concept was pre fixed menu and wanted to try it out.Service was impeccable. Food was great for some,blah for the others. out of 12 courses I only liked about 50%.Its not only a delight for your palate but visually as well. The dishes were deconstructed and portions were really tiny. Talk about portion control!!, **THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE COFFEE BAR**Coffee + Fried Chicken = Confused ElationSo, this place is not the closest coffee shop for us, so it says a lot that we venture on down here just for it. The main draw for us is the fried chicken sandwich, which I think keeps me coming back not just because it delicious, but also because I haven really had a combination of flavors quite like it. It a bit spicy, but we follow it up with a delicious Brisket Roll to cool our mouths down (available Saturdays only)!Ie never had a savory (read: meaty) roll, but the Brisket Roll is a huge surprise. It has very finely-shredded, lightly-flavored brisket rolled into it (think of how the cinnamon paste is rolled into a cinnamon roll) and there not so much that it messes with the roll texture. Because that would be a crime. The rolls are soft, sweet, and simply delicious, so my dessert comes in the form of the Pineapple Roll with a skillfully-made iced coffee. They put love into this stuff, man!Just a tip: the sandwich gets a little messy, but they neatly gift-wrap it for you to keep it contained, so keep it wrapped until the last bite.On a beautiful day, grab some nums, take a walk up to Eastern Market, and enjoy your morning!Did I say roll enough??, 4.5 stars. So my husband gave me one pick for my early birthday celebration - Komi or P&P. Since we loved Aaron Silverman Rose Luxury and heard about Michelin recent visit, I picked P&P to try a newer dining experience in DC that literally opened four months ago. The service was impeccable from the moment we walked in the door to finish, where we were beyond stuffed and given goodie bags of coffee and shortbread to bring home. We were greeted immediately as we arrived and since we were 15 minutes early, they bought out two cocktails - one with sake and one with prosecco as we waited for our seats at the bar. They were so personal as they wished me a happy birthday twice, as well as surprised me with slices of cake and candle by their amazing pastry chef! Water was refilled promptly and crumbs were cleaned off our table throughout the evening. All the servers were warm, attentive and knowledgeable. Presentation of the food was very attention to detail, even to the selection of plates to the water pitcher. I love vintage gold, so I fell in love with the gold folks and spoons, gold shakers and gold water pitchers. Each plate and bowl, whether classic, modern or vintage, had a story of its own and they added to the inspiration of the food. The chef tasting menu was a combination of favorites with several that weren too much. I love the creative and gastronomic touch on some dishes, and their taste were good but nothing extraordinary. My favorites from the evening include: - Baby Elotes - The chef take on Mexican corn. Absolutely delicious! The husk was edible! - Black Pepper Pan Au Lait - The best buttery and flaky mini biscuit Ie had with really good homemade butter. - Sweetbread Stuffed Chicken Wing - This beats all fancy schmancy fried chicken with its super crispy and super light batter.- Summer Red Curry & Coconut Rice - Definitely an Asian inspired dish and the coconut rice was personally very good because it reminded me of a rice dish my mom made. The seafood curry broth was flavorful but a tad bit salty. I not sure how much of the prawns head, lemongrass, curry leaves, and coconut is actually infused into the broth by the coffee siphon. I preferred my husband spicy vegetable substitute broth (he has crab allergy). - Roasted Fig Crostata - If youe a fig lover, this is the pastry for you! The caramelized turbinado sugar adds a nice sweetness and the pastry dough is so flaky. The fig in the center was heaven. I just wish I wasn so stuffed at the time to finish it! I would give the food four stars, but it about the experience, the full package. The creative plating, service, ambiance, and food gives them a solid 4.5 stars. Thank you P&P and chef Aaron Silverman for another wonderful dining experience!, I only tried the Vietnamese coffee. Service was great. Staff is very friendly. VietnameseIced coffee is really good. I will be coming back., Pineapple & Pearls (P&P) is a fairy tale celebration of whimsical food+drinks and theatrical presentations cossetted by exquisite service that is smoothly choreographed while still relaxed, unpretentious, and fun to meld with the classy yet comfortable ambiance. Chef/Owner Aaron Silverman, Beverage Director Jeff Faile, and team have created a magical experience ideal for a truly special occasion--my dining companion birthday!For the occasion, we chose the bar seating since we did not want the full drink pairings of the dining room and chef counter (5+ drinks). A major pleasant surprise was Chef Aaron personally presenting 3 of 12 courses! In fact, we found the bar ideal for us because we loved the service of the team at the bar, watching Jeff crafting our and otherscocktails, the merry company of our neighbors, and the breeze of coffee from the espresso bar just behind the bar. Another perk was having the bathrooms just behind the bar--handy when enjoying the fabulous drinks!Our selections(we noted no mammal/bird organs) with standouts marked *:KIR ROYAL & APRICOT-MATCHA SAKE w/ ShisoArriving early, we had a moment to enjoy the weather and sip on a few very refreshing welcome cocktails*FENNEL BON BON of Fennel, Yogurt, Raisin, and Citrus over APPLE-SUNCHOKE-FENNEL ABSINTHE with Bouquet of HerbsLike a savory chocolate truffle with lovely blend of flavor notes and textures (beet sugar shell), the whole presentation with the mini-cocktail made an eye-opening first impression.*CRISPY YUBA with CURED SALMON ROE, Dill Cream, Micro Shiso, Lavender, and other GARDEN HERBSAs my DC described, a walk in an aromatic garden with lovely pop of roe and gentle crunch of the fried soy milk skin.AIRMAILAs we requested, Jeff specially prepared this not-too-sweet-but-bubbly cocktail that paired well with many of the early courses.* JEFF SPECIAL of Gin, Bubbly, Apricot Liqueur, and GingerEven better than the Airmail, it is more refreshing thanks to the gin and stayed bubbly longer.

The food, while occasionally not as matured, is full of excitement as we prefer risk-taking and being rewarded with gems over safe play. All in all, considering the quality, variety, presentations, service, and complete experience (2.5-4 hours), the $150/person (all-inclusive for food and welcome cocktails) dinner at the bar is very reasonable., I wanted to love this place so much after all the articles and reviews I read. I was super excited to try one of their nut milk lattes. I went with hazelnut and was glad I did when I heard the cashier explaining the difference between the pistachio and hazelnut milk to another customer. I love hazelnut anything and everything and she said, Basically, it really nutty tasting, so chose the nut you prefer because that is what it is going to taste like. Duh, right? WRONG! It tasted nothing like hazelnut. If anything it tasted fruity. The bean they used to brew the espresso must have been a really fruity bean because it was like watered down, fruity coffee. Such a let down., Words cannot express how much I loved this place. Such a fantastic and enjoyable experience. Aaron Silverman, keep on doing what youre doing because you are awesome., A doggy bag does tell a great story! All because the waitress poorly communicated or misinterpreted my order she first charged me for my girlfriends order when and never asked if we were together or if the order was together. Ordered a dirty chai and asked for whip cream and he said they don do whip so I guess that means no. Waited about 4 min for the lady to come back with a very nicely packaged box but since the order shoulde been separate we asked for two boxes. Waited 4 more mins for her to bring us these bags and says and I quote the box had samples of everything but since you wanted it separate and shrugs shoulders!! Never Again!, I wish there were a way to elevate this beyond five stars; this was the best meal Ive had in my life. I went there in April about three weeks after they opened and was able to get a chair at the chefs table. I arrived a few minutes before they opened at 5:30 to find a locked door; however, they promptly opened and brought me in on the dot in the coffee shop with a welcoming drink. After a small conversation, I was guided back to the chefs table and had a chance to talk to Aaron Silverman for a few minutes before everything started, cool experience and a really friendly guy. The meal itself consisted of 15 courses and 6 drinks spread over about three hours. I really enjoyed everything I ate there; the mole smoked beef rib is literally the best thing Ive ever eaten in my life. The homemade vanilla ice cream with caramel crunch and chocolate souffle was amazing as well. If you finish your drink before the course finishes, they very willingly fill up your glass again. After the meal is over and while on sensory overload, they gave me a departing gift of four house-made donuts, biscottis, and a small helping of coffee. I hope the Michelin guide gives this the rating it deserves. If and when I leave DC, Im going to make this place my last meal., Well Ive now been to both the restaurant and coffee bar. Ive been the coffee bar at least 7 times now. You cant go wrong with any of the coffees! The sweetest bun is the pineapple and pearls, a good mid-range bun is the cinnamon bun, and if youre a lucky weekend goer you might be able to get the brisket bun. The chicken sandwich is worth it too and more filling than its size suggests!The customer service Ive received here is always amazing, but eating in the restaurant is just a different world in all aspects. First of all, you have to plan in advance. Set a google reminder 4 weeks in advance of when you want to visit. Create your account beforehand and log on immediately at 10 and just click the first thing you can and cross your fingers you get it. I was lucky to get a Friday 8:45pm reservation for two just days before my 30th birthday. You pay 50% at the time of booking and 50% the day of dinner. I also received an email confirming any allergies and special celebrations. The planning and follow up is spot on!We arrived right on time (they dont suggest arriving too early and in some cases other diners run over their time). We were warmly greeted, I was wished Happy Birthday, and we were offered our choice of 2 before dinner drinks. We got one of each and happily sipped and traded. Just as we finished we were told they were ready to show us our seats. Behind the magic curtain is a small but well spaced restaurant with a bar, a few tables and booths, and a counter that seats 8 facing the kitchen. We got central counter seats. Although we were propped on stools all night they had small backs and were cushy so we didnt find ourselves uncomfortable.Since this is already getting long Ill just share some basics and the highlights. You get to choose sparkling or still water, and we were served 6 different alcoholic drinks that were gladly topped off if we ever finished our glass. The 12 food courses (plus 1 bonus birthday course) were spaced out and not rushed. They typically suggest dinner will take 2.5 hours but ours took 3.5 total. Each course was presented by a different chef, waiter, or employee. You could tell everyone really cares about the work they put in and they genuinely want you to enjoy and have an experience youll remember. One dish was brought out by Aaron Silverman and it wasnt hard to get as excited as he was! Charred sungold tomatoes and peach broth. It was my fianc39s absolute favorite dish! Unfortunately for me tomatoes taste like poison and the cilantro oil tastes like soap. Not my favorite but the peach broth was good ;)The portions are small but before you know if you are stuffed! The pacing and size of the food makes you find room and keep going, and the flowing booze sure doesnt hurt either. The Fairy tale eggplant tart was the most whimsical dish Ive ever eaten. And although the coffee siphon curry broth was really cool in presentation it was way too salty for my taste. Every dish is different and there are definite highs and lows, but overall one of the most memorable food experiences Ive ever had. Taking photos of everything was an extra bonus for me. (Lowkey food photography hobbyist over here--I uploaded EVERY course on here and facebook). The high cost and pressure to make a reservation is well worth it! I highly recommend Pineapple & Pearls to any foodie., This should really be separated into two different listings for the cafe and the restaurant, though my rating for both is the same. We celebrated our wedding anniversary last night at the restaurant and had an amazing evening. Ive always loved the service at Roses, and the service here was similar - really well executed but much friendlier than I feel like Ive experienced in other fine dining situations. We chose to sit at the bar and do beverages a la carte, and were very happy with our choice. The tasting menu itself is $150, and the beverage pairing adds another $100. I dont doubt that its worth it, but since its largely wine and were not big wine connoisseurs, we were happier ordering cocktails off of the menu. The cocktails were awesome. Despite skipping the pairing, we were still given small cocktails when we arrived, which was a nice touch. Mine had soju and some kind of fruit, and was excellent. My husbands was some kind of gin and cucumber thing and was also good, but I thought mine was more interesting. During the meal, we ordered the Red Bird, the Japanese Sazerac, the Pineapple & Coconut, and the White. All of these except the White are from the second portion of the menu, which are more expensive ($20, or the equivalent of about $15 since tax and tip are included) but also sort of showy in ways I wont get into too much since I dont want to spoil the surprise. The White ($16, or around $12 without tax/tip) had a simpler presentation, but was also really delicious and very different. They dont have any beers on the menu, but when my husband asked they were able to find him a beer that he really liked. The food itself is wonderful. My favorite courses were the bread, the eggplant tart, the steak, the blueberry shortcake, and the fig galette. The only course I thought was only okay was the tomato/peach soup - I just expected the flavors to be a little bit stronger. But overall, a wonderful experience that we will definitely remember and that I would highly recommend to others., Apologies in advance as there will be no photos attached to this review. I could give a reason like it is a magical place and it is best experienced without upfront information (this is true)---but really I just ate everything too fast to document it. We went for lunch at the coffee bar which has a small curated menu. You order at the register and they bring the food out in fancy gold and white boxes inside black gift bags. It was a little over the top but you could tell that even down to the package presentation the place had a thoughtful , consistent theme. We all got the spicy fried chicken sandwich and a Mexican hot chocolate roll. These were off the charts excellent. I heard a rumor that the restaurant name was chosen to be purposefully off-putting as a challenge to see if clients would come just for the food. Based on the creative presentation and high flavor meal this kitchen is clearly not resting on their laurels or phoning it in! This was a memorable meal that hit the spot., Fantastic and worth every penny. We sat at the bar and did a cocktail pairing instead of the traditional wine paring, so much fun and really innovative flavors., Beyond beyond beyond!! Exceeded all expectations from service to food and ambience. We enjoyed 12 courses with 7 alcoholic drink pairings, although the nonalcoholic options looked more creative and more delicious! One friend chose the nonalcoholic beverages and we were quite envious. Every single person from the front of the house to the kitchen provided impeccable, warm, welcoming service and ensured the highest quality experience. Worth every penny - THE BEST MEAL IVE HAD IN MANY YEARS. The combination of flavors took you on beautiful adventures. ;-) pictures below with each dish. Two of us opted to not have sweetbreads and our chicken wings were stuffed with kimchi. I truly can not pick one favorite - but my tops were the fennel absinthe bonbon, black pepper pan au lait with the liver mousse (made us want to lick the bowl clean); charred sungold tomatoes and peach broth; chicken wing; summer red curry & coconut rice (I could eat the rice and broth all night); & the olive oil ice cream was my fav with the crostata. RUN and grab your reservation - you dont want to miss out on the experience. Located next to Roses luxury., FYI: This review is strictly for the coffee bar and lunchtime sandwiches.A friend and I were wishfully hoping for a brunch deal on a Friday before a federal holiday. We found a super early Happy Hour nearby but stumbled here by chance. Man are we glad that we did! Although just sandwiches and pastries available around lunchtime, they were possibly the best sandwiches we ever had. I got the spicy chicken sandwich (not too spicy so you should definitely try it!) and my friend got the smoked salmon one. Both were amazingly delicious, seemingly simple based on the menu yet so many complex levels of flavors in each one. We were pleasantly surprised. Im salivating right now just thinking about it lol. Service is SUPER courteous, nice, helpful, nonjudgemental( my friend knocked over their coffee and one of the ladies calmly and happily helped us clean it up!) and just overall pleasant. In love with this place. I cant wait to actually try the tasting menu(dinner) Ive been hearing so much about.
55|plume-washington|This place is a treat. From the moment you arrive, service is extremely efficient, warm and friendly. The food is wonderful and the ambience is unmatched in Washington. The bartender, who has returned after the two-year renovation of the Jefferson Hotel, gave us a great little tour of the completely renovated lobby/ground floor. Bring a thick wallet and enjoy a really terrific dining experience., Oh. My. God. This place rocks. We brought a sixty year old rice wine from Shanghai with us to go along with the amazing cuisine here. Everything was incredible. Its not *the* best restaurant in D.C. but it is absolutely in my top three. I loved the basil sorbet and got to try the most amazing fish. Their desserts rock, no doubt about it. The staff knew it was my birthday, but they didnt do anything special besides smile. Not that I wanted them to do something, but hey, a candle in the dessert would have looked nice in a photo! Oh well... If they specialize in food, then at least theyve got that down pat., beautiful meal! we went here for my birthday dinner...food was fantastic, wine list was out of this world....and holy cow (and goat) the cheese cart!!staff was very attentive, but the pacing of some of our tasting menu courses was a bit lagging. very purple, 18th century french decor ... dont see much of that in DC. two thumbs way up, i found it better than citronelle., I didnt think I could consider myself a full-blown foodie until I found Plume. I love fancy restaurants and chefs tasting menus but I still grimace when I have to eat foie gras (liver pate is not for me) or sweetbreads (neither is veal thymus gland), which of course being at a french restaurant was all over the menu :P However, wanting to try the chefs tasting menu on New Years day made me face my foie gras bias. Firstly, the Jefferson Hotel underwent a huge 2 year renovation which obviously makes it a gorgeous place to walk into for dinner. It reeks of an old-world sophistication but with very subtle tones of snobbery so you knew it was classy but not pretentious. My boyfriend and I were first escorted to a small table in the main dining area and she put down a mini purple velvet ottoman for my bag (one star for managements thinking about my bag!) but bf has a thing about always wanting to sit next to each other rather than across so he requested for a table where we could sit side by side. Luckily the place was still bare, so they escorted us to a nook in the front beside the grand piano and fountain. We end up sitting on this lush day bed with over a dozen lavender and silver pillows and then had a candle-lit table pushed up to us. Ambiance and Service=Perfect.So we decide to do the $85 chefs menu. I hesitate with the foie gras so asked the waiter if I could replace it with something else on the appetizer list like the poached egg. He comes back saying its possible but will be charged another $10 for the egg. Minus one star. So I make the decision to try the liver (or just give it to the bf). The entire meal must have taken over 2.5 hours to serve and eat but it was absolutely magnificent. I ended up liking the foie gras (its still not my favorite but will do), they had an absolutely scintillating lobster-apple chutney-curry and their pineapple-chocolate-caramel dessert with pina colada sorbet ended the meal perfectly. We were impressed that before each major course was a tiny pre-course that cleared the palate very well so that we could enjoy the next treasure. The one thing i wasnt impressed with was the dry aged beef- the beef was perfectly cooked and the potatoes were great but it just wasnt my taste. It was also the only beef on the menu, so a bit disappointed that they didnt have a great steak or something else for me to come back for. Overall=beautiful place with impeccable service. Chefs menu was original with fresh tastes that Ive never had before but choices are a bit lacking. Considering that it just opened a few months ago, I will definitely be back for more. 4.5 stars. :), Plume has the best ambiance in DC by far! Wow! And the service was great too. We chatted with the manager for awhile too. Just a great place all around (check out the bars and the library too).As for the food, it was really good...not amazing, but really good. Marcels and Komi are still my top picks for DC, but Plume is doing well!, I went to this restaurant for valentines day. Ill try to break it down as much as possible to get a good idea of what the experience is like.Arrived little late, good valet service, excellent ambiance, and excellent service. All very good.Received the menu and house made sparkling water. Water was excellent, and free. I think the menu was set at $165 pp. Which was little higher than my previous valentines dinner at other 5 star rest., but whatever. The dinner was 8 course.My date ordered some valentine drink, which was great but weak on alcohol. I had a glass of bordeaux to start off with. We had 4 course of appetizers, which included soup, salad, oysters (2 different time). I would give it 2 stars.Main course was 2 dish. First was pan-seared tuna, which was good, but not excellent, since I had better. I would give it 4/5 stars. Next was a 2 meat dish, rib cooked in soy sauce, and dry-aged filet (medium-rare). Filet was excellent (5/5) but the rib was ok (3/5). Maybe its because Im korean, and we have 30 different ways to cook rib steak. In fact, we had better rib (cooked similar style) earlier in the day with grandma. I would give entree, overall 4.5/5Desert was some rice pudding and chocolate filled with green tea filling. This wasnt impressive, maybe 2/5, very disappointed in the desert area. Maybe disappointed is little weak, frankly it sucked.End of the night, dinner for 2, with 4 drinks came out to $520 including tips and tax. Thats premium pricing, but subpar food. I think this dinner borders on scam. Like I said, excellent service and good ambiance. I noticed that most of the people were elderly, so maybe they were aiming for their taste buds. Im in mid 30s, and this dinner was little underwelming. In fact, my date suggest we spend little extra and goto PerSe in NY. I would agree. Skip this place. Overall 3/5, and thats being generous., 2.5 stars. I had a bad experience here and while I appreciate the atmosphere (lovely) and the food (interesting, beautifully presented) the experience is a horrible memory and I would not ever return. Basically we were kicked out, after spending hundreds on dinner. My friend, who had had a pre-dinner cocktail, enjoyed some wine with dinner, and then had some dessert wine with our dessert/cheese course, was cut off. It was EXTREMELY embarrassing. I can believe they did it. After dinner we went to the bar so we could continue talking and having a nice time. The bar manager came over and said they couldn serve us. I was stunned. I wasn drunk - I wasn even buzzed. I am not sure why in the world they did it. Sure, she had been drinking but this was over the course of FOUR hours and she was in no way sloppy drunk or embarrassing. In the interest of full disclosure, the four of us shared 2 bottles of wine at dinner. Dinner was 2 and a half hours long so, figure a glass or glass and a half of wine an hour. How many people have a cocktail before dinner, some wine, and then an after dinner drink? Um, plenty, in all of the fine restaurants throughout DC. And, I must say, I have been to many fine restaurants in DC and seen PLENTY of drinking happening at the tables. I guess Plume wants to set itself apart as being the Victorian, puritanical, judgmental, embarrass-your-customer one? Anyway, I debated even posting this because I (1) recognize how absurd it sounds - I can hardly believe it myself to this day and (2) recognize that readers might say to themselves yeah, right - they were probably wasted and deserved it but I assure you that wasn the case. I not that classless and, honestly, if we wanted to get drunk I certainly wouldn pay all this money to do it at a fine (and expensive) restaurant. When I spoke with the restaurant floor manager to say how horrified we were, he was indifferent at best - in fact I think he was the one who ordered that it be done! So, clearly the decision came from the top. He said something about setting themselves apart - I kid you not. I am sharing this experience because you should know about it if youe planning on going there, and thinking youe going to be able to have a good time. Stay sober, my friends. Plume is going to judge you for it. (as a side note, if you do go, I would recommend that you request one of the side rooms, or the back room, because the front part of the dining room abutts the lobby and it rather feels like youe dining in the lobby of the hotel). I regret that such a lovely experience was marred by that extremely strange decision - and extremely boorish and improper handling of it - on the part of management. Clearly Il be patronizing different restaurants in the future. Ie warned a lot of people about this and debated posting a review to Yelp but decided customers have a right to know ...so now I am warning you., I had two great experiences at Plume in February. The ambiance of the Jefferson Hotel is so delightful, a boutique hotel and stylish. Definitely a well-trained and courteous staff. One of Washingtons finest. At Plume I had a range of dishes over two meals that were delicious. I would highly recommend the scallop boudin blanc. What an interesting twist on the traditional dish. Dont dine here without trying the foie gras - it is foie gras done three ways. Really amazing. I am not a fan of lamb, but wow--its served with fennel and a licorice jus. I felt like I was in Paris, which is always a good thing., Based on service and ambiance, Plume deserves a full blown five stars. The sommelier came from The French Laundry and hand picked each wine for the restaurant. We got to talking, since we had been to The French Laundry while visiting Napa, and he gave us a tour of the office and showed us all of the wine Plume offered. Amazing. The food is ok for me. While the ingredients were very high quality ingredients such as truffles, foie gras, and gold leaf, its like they just took these great ingredients and threw them together. Many of the dishes had the same flavors. And not one wowed me. Which is a shame, since our 10 course meal and half bottle of wine cost us $450. Although I appreciate what the chef is doing, it doesnt do it for me. But it really is just my opinion.. dont let that sway you from coming here. We were given complimentary dessert along with dessert wine, which complimented each other very well.. probably my favorite part of the meal. Also, when you leave, they send you off with a little goody bag with a list of the wines you had with your meal and a box of chocolates compliments of the pastry chef. All in all, Plume is an exquisite restaurant, and worth trying, for the sake of it. *Complimentary valet*Complimentary sparkling water, Four of us had dinner at Plume the other night and a wonderful experience. The service was remarkable. Informed and friendly. The wine list was very good, organized and priced right. We ordered ala carte, the sweetbreads tasted clean, delicate, perfect. All the main courses had a very Daniel influence. Fresh ingredients shining through. The poulard, great. The sole, interesting presentation yet pure taste. The lobster had a wonderful delicate taste. The cheese cart is an amazing decadent machine. I highly recommend this restaurant especially for a special intimate dinner., When we walked into the Jefferson, ready for our belated Aquarian dinner with our dear friends Bondrew, it had been quite a few years since I had the opportunity to sit down to such a wonderful meal. The service was impeccable, and the meal was really enjoyable. Timing, though, was not so smooth - there was quite a lag between a couple of our courses. This lag, however, was not the excuse for the fact that we were one of the first tables seated and the last ones to leave at the end of the night.We all settled on the 7-course meal, but relied on the expertise of our dear friend Andrew to select the wines. As usual, his selections did not disappoint.Did I forget to mention that one of the courses was foie gras with pop rocks? Yeah, you read that right. And for me - it worked. It wasnt such a hit with our whole table, but I really enjoyed it.If a place could remind us of our multi-course meal that the four of us shared with close friends over Thanksgiving at LOustau de Baumaniere in les Baux 5 years ago, I have a feeling that I will be back. The language here may not be as elegant as what we had overseas, but the cheese incubator fooled us aplenty. For just the foie and cheese - Id take another table here., The romantic ambiance, service, and quality food are what gives this restaurant three stars in my book. For a romantic meal for two there are few locations in DC that can provide a setting that takes you away from the hustle and bustle of DC and transforms you to a place far away in both time and place. The Jefferson Hotel reminds you why Thomas Jefferson was a Francophile in the 18th Century. Unfortunately, the restaurant fails to live up to its pomp on the plate. The food is good, but not memorable and often lacks flavor. There is something to say for simplicity, but for the prices and the setting one hopes to be wowed on all levels., Based on Tom Sietsemas review for the Washington Post, my husband booked a Valentines Day dinner at Plume two months in advance. (Normally, I dont get to go where I had hoped to because he books so late.) His early planning paid off, and we were not disappointed. The atmosphere is amazing. I have never been to such a gorgeous, romantic restaurant. We booked a table in a little side room that had only two tables. It felt like we were on our own private garden patio. The beautiful couch on which we sat/reclined could not have been any more comfortable either. Really, the entire hotel is quite attractive. Even the bathrooms are impressive in an elegant, but not gaudy way. I can not begin to describe the food. I can say that even the salads were impressive. Im a picky eater, particularly when it comes to vegetables, but I gladly gobbled up everything they put in front of me. Cheese lovers will be in heaven; after meals, the waitstaff wheels out a two-tiered cart of cheeses from around the world. You can choose to sample as many as you would like, and the staff is well-prepared to make recommendations. The somelier comes from the French Laundry in Napa. Hes a young, affable guy and makes great recommendations. We were pleased to be able to order a half bottle -- just enough to enjoy over an entree without getting tipsy. Its nice to see a restaurant that offers a wide variety of choices even in wines by the glass and half bottle. Dessert really impressed me. I ordered a chocolate dessert that was a plate of various small treats including a tart, truffle, and custard. I could not help but ooh and ahh every tasting each one. Before the check came, a complimentary small plate of sweets was brought to our table. As a person with a sweet tooth, I was delighted. When we departed the restaurant, we were given a little bag with a printout of the wine we had ordered that night as well as a tiny box containing mini biscotti. It was a very nice touch. The price is steep. Im used to three figure dinners at nice restaurants, but this is probably the most expensive meal Ive ever enjoyed. Id still say that Plume is well worth it for the milestone occasions in ones life. The bar is also quite elegant. It might be a less expensive way to enjoy Plumes luxe atmosphere and great wine list., All the Right Looks, All the Wrong Moves. We took a quick weekend trip down from NYC to DC to see the Cherry Blossoms and stayed at the Jefferson Hotel.I had called ahead to ask if both diners were required to order the tasting menu, as my wife has pescetarian/vegetarian leanings and would not eat the lamb, among other items. The restaurant receptionist was very accommodating, and it sounded as if they were well-versed in serving optional courses for guests with dietary restrictions. We were looking forward to a wonderful dining experience, and were impressed that a restaurant of their caliber would customize the menu for us.The restaurant, along with the entire hotel, was beautifully renovated 7 months ago. The greenhouse, fireplace and lovingly restored original crown moulding details were picturesque and romantic. The manager (more on him later) greeted us at the door and was very friendly. I will cut to the chase: Service was ill-timed, brusque, inattentive, uncoordinated, uninformed and a bit robotic (think: broken robot). Although attractively presented, the food profiles were not exciting Read: BLAND and I question some of the serving temperatures and cooking techniques.The most egregious offense was the service. After being seated at a great table in a very intimate dining room, we waited for menus. Then water. Then Bread. After waiting at our table for 5-10 minutes, the manager came over and asked how we had enjoyed our day in the city. He realized our drink and meal orders had not been taken, so he obliged. 2 Italian olive oils and 3 international sea salts (for bread) were delivered 10 minutes AFTER we had eaten our warm bread (Tasty). Water bottles were slammed on the table, our server kept reaching across the table between the 2 of us to adjust for the next course, and he mumbled out a few basic ingredients: Halibut, Lamb, beets. What is the sauce with the Lamb?, I enquired. Um, wine sauce. After a second reading of the menu, turns out it was black olive infused jus. I didn know what that is, but shouldn our waitstaff?I was hoping to have a glass of wine with my 4th course (Seared Filet of Halibut and Morels) but our server was no where to be found. He finally asked at the 6th course if I would like another glass.The Food:We both ordered the 7 course tasting menu. My wife Lamb was replaced by an asparagus napolean.Our Amuse Bouche was a harbinger of things to come. Poorly done Tuna cube and run-of-the-mill mini-puffed cheese pastry. There was a second curious amuse bouche of cauliflower and cracked white pepper. Very bland, and the cauliflower was nearly frozen from sitting pre-prepared in the walk-in.The Veloute of celery root, black truffle and apple remoulade was my favorite dish, and buoyed our hopes again that all was not lost. With that said, the raw celery root and truffle mixture at the center of the veloute seemed a little unfinished.The Roasted local beet salad was a downer. The menu said Szechuan Pepper, but mine must have been missing it. No Flavor. See: Zaytinya, also in DC, for goat cheese beet salad done right.Seared Filet of Halibut with Spring garlic and morels. At this point, we were hungry and desperate for some tasty sustenance. The halibut was cooked well, although under seasoned.Roasted Loin of Lamb was wrapped in eggplant. My aforementioned sauce was a congealed smear, and I could not taste it. The lamb was tender and juicy with clean flavors. A large chunk of fat was left on mine, and the meat (Medium rare) needed to be seared or roasted on the exterior just a little bit longer to contrast the texture (I think the eggplant moistened the exterior too much, and did not allow the meat to be cooked properly)Asparagus Napolean (my wife veggie alternate)OK, but the ratio of sauce/asparagus with puffed pastry was too high on starch.Strawberry Shortbread, basil ice cream with candied basilCandied basil was inspired, but the shortcake was not soft and light, it was dense and crunchy like a stale cookie.Not once did our server ask about our meal or wine.He did wheel around a massive cheese cart and asked us if we wanted some not included in your tasting menu fromage. We declined. I mentioned to him that I might want a glass of muscat and asked for a menu. Instead, we ordered green tea and a cappucino. After our hot drinks were served, he asked if we wanted to order the muscat. Clueless.Our server dropped off the check, and we never saw him again. I believe a better level of service may have resulted in a more enjoyable experience, and I suppose the restaurant is still having growing pains (only 7 months old); but the food was NOT worth the visit.Full disclosure: Upon leaving, I dropped off a comments card to the front desk. The manager must have read it within 24 hours, because our bill was reduced 50% at check-out. While I appreciate the gesture, I would have preferred a wonderful dinner the night before..., disclaimer...my sole dining experience with plume has been the seven-course tasting menu, and i cannot speak to the deliciousness (or not) of their entrees. but for my meal, i would say that i was underwhelmed with the cuisine. that doesnt mean food was not good, but it just didnt blow me away. tasting menus at these prices and with the proposed caliber of restaurant are expected to have you reminiscing about those memorable dishes days after the food has passed your digestive track. however, the only dish that was memorable in my book was memorable for its failure in execution. so based on food alone, id have to say it was good, but perhaps not worth it. but whatever plume lacked in cooking department, it made up for it with a-list service. the dining experience at plume is meant to be spread out of numerous hours...to be filled with conversation with slow sips of well-recommended wines...so attentive service definitely made our 3 hour meal relaxing and quite enjoyable., Chef Damon Gordon should be ashamed of himself. My family and I decided to try his 10-course tasting menu. This was a huge mistake, as it led to possibly the WORST dining experience I have ever endured. His hamachi amuse bouche reeked of week-old fish, seared scallops were just as unpleasant and the rest of the meal was mediocre at best. Considering the supposed quality of this restaurant using subpar ingredients (frozen fish, etc.) in an attempt to pass off unpalatable food as gourmet is a disgrace to fine dining. The only saving grace to this restaurant may be its service, which is the least Plume can offer in exchange for an overpriced, unimpressive, borderline unbearable eating experience.There are so many OTHER great places in DC. This place should be avoided at all costs., elegant & extremely romantic. Stellar service. Delicious & artful 10-course tasting menu., Its been well over a year since I last enjoyed Plume but after having read some of the disparaging reviews, I wanted to Yelp in. Heres the thing.... dont show up to Plume in your Hudson jeans and your rock and roll attitude. Dont come to get your drink on. Dont come thinking that $150 per person is outrageous (which, maybe it is, but dont bring that attitude. I can tell you about other less pricey restaurants if you need one). Dont come looking for foam or pate made from anchovie hearts.This is a French Restaurant. It brings the glam. Its intimate and delicious and pricey and special. I cant remember the menu or even the bill.What I do recall? This is an experience. The food is artfully prepared and professionally served. The atmosphere is sophisticated and refined. The wines are choice.As far as I am concerned, Plume is one of the districtss better kept secrets. While I would love for the restaurant to receive its accolades, I certainly dont want it cheapened by a bunch of hipster spendsters looking to get their groove on., If youre looking for a luxurious experience, with an interesting wine list & a great sommelier, then this is a very good pick. But, if you demand excellent food, especially when youre paying high prices, then im not sure i would pick plume. Some of the dishes really needed editing, and were inconsistent or not quite balanced. My duck ragout app, for example, had wonderful ragout, but too large of a portion relative to the completely overpowered artichokes. The pumpkin souffle a bit too sweet. And so on. But, its absolutely beautiful inside, and it does feel like a special night out., I have eaten at Plume twice: once for the regular prix fixe menu and once for their special white truffle dinner. Decor is opulent. Service is perfectly toned - as attentive as you might ever want, but not smothering. The food is decadent and executed perfectly. And their cheese cart is SUPER impressive. One thing I loved about the white truffle dinner, which we got with the wine pairings, is that they were very generous with wine - we never felt they were trying to skimp. True, this place is pricey. But once you observe the excellent service and outstanding food (as well as a stellar wine and Madeira list), you will look at it as well worth saving up for.As another diner mentioned, this is definitely a place to dress up for - men will be most comfortable in a sport coat. Also, ladies, they give you this really cool little cushioned stool for your purse to rest on. Yes, for your purse.P.S. The only thing better than eating at Plume is staying in the hotel after eating at Plume. Absolutely top-notch in every way (particularly love the huge container of bath salts next to the tub)., A fantastic dining experience. We were seated in a separate, enclosed room that we shared with another table. We sat side-by-side on an ornate sofa, which was romantic but uncomfortable because I couldn lean back.Bf and I had the tasting menu sans pairings. From start to finish, we counted seven different servers who assisted us with various aspects of our meal.The sommelier was knowledgeable, though I wish she could have given us more attention during the selection process.The amuse bouche was tuna tartare. It was fresh, delectable and a nice welcoming bite to the meal we were about to enjoy.It was followed by a foie gras ravioli, which was divine, though a tad salty.Next came a tropical salad consisting of mango, avocado, beets, and mixed greens. I thought it needed some acid. The bf wasn a fan.A pair of spooning shrimp on a bed of risotto with a shrimp pillow ensued. The presentation was adorable and appropriate for the upcoming Valentine Day celebration. The shrimp was tender and the bed of risotto was an interesting interpretation. It was again a touch salty. I thought the pillow was more decorative than functional. It lacked flavor and the jelly-like texture of it didn complement the other components of the dish.Our entrees were the filet of prime beef, a generous portion of beef with a side of buttery mashed potatoes. It was deliciously tender and I wanted to finish it, but at this point of the meal, I was stuffed. I had to give up with half of the dish uneaten.We were given a pre-dessert dessert, a palate cleanser consisting of a spoonful of guava ice cream with coconut shavings and tiny mango spheres. I loved it.The piece de resistance was the homemade cinnamon doughnuts. They were crisp on the outside and doughy (and slightly undercooked) on the inside. The pineapple and kumquat chutney was sour. I enjoyed the refreshing coconut sorbet.Service was excellent. Various servers constantly checked our table to see if it needed to be cleared or if our glasses needed to be refilled. The hostess and door attendant were pleasant and efficient. We were sent out with a bag of chocolates and the name of the wine we drank that night. We were helped into our coats and a taxi was promptly called for us when we saw that it was snowing.Over all, it was a memorable experience. The ambiance was quiet and romantic. Some of the courses were great and some were not-so-great. We would definitely return and try the regular menu. By the way, the chocolates that came home with us were amazing. One was a caramel lemon truffle and the other was a dark chocolate truffle. I could eat a box of those every day., Superb. In the same league as Inn at Little Washington, but without the drive., Best restaurant for a nice quiet meal, could be better quality for the price, yet stellar service and friendly staff., Absolutely beyond anything I could have imagined. The service was courteous and attentive, which I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. But the food. Oh the food. I can still the remember the way that it tasted and salivate just a little thinking about it. Go go go. you wont be disappointed., I love going to Plume. I have been treated to dinner here multiple times over the past few years, and I get excited to go every time because its such a wonderful experience. The service, although formal, is incredibly warm, which allows you to have a proper formal dining experience without any snootiness. The staff are extremely knowledgeable and accommodating, and the dishes are consistently well-prepared, nicely presented, and delicious. Every time I leave Plume, I feel utterly gratified having had such a fantastic dining experience. Plume is perfect for a special occasion---you will not be disappointed!, I went last night and had a very nice dinner. The decor is lovely...you feel like youre in a beautiful conservatory in France. However, at $600 for 2, the quality of the food is simply not up to the price. The service was very good and the wine pairings were lovely. Great dinner and stunning atmosphere. But,, unfortunately, the food is simply over-rated and over-priced., I took my girlfriend here two weeks ago and it was absolutely amazing. The food was great, but the service and ambiance are what truly set this place apart IMO. Very elegant decor and the staff make you feel like they are thrilled to have you there. Five stars - I had a great experience at the Plume and look forward to eating there again soon!, We were staying at the Jefferson while in DC and decided to do the tasting menu at Plume. In the beginning, service was excellent. My husband had the wine pairings with the menu and the sommelier described them to him and substituted a different wine when mullet was substituted for the soft shell crab. I appreciated the filling of my water with filtered water (done in house). We enjoyed the amuse bouche (both of them, a bechamel bread and a gazpacho), the salad and foie gras with strawberries and the linguini. The dinner took a turn for the worse with the main course, which was a cote de boeuf for both of us. Mine had tendon-y gristle through the middle of 3 out of the 4 pieces. Now, by this time I was okay with only eating 2 1/2 pieces, so that wasnt too much of a problem. When the waiter commented on my not having eaten it, I mentioned that it was too tendon-y (actually a piece was stuck in my teeth and having chewed one piece for a few minutes, I had to discretely spit it out into a piece of bread). He asked if he could get me something else and I said no, I had had enough food anyway. I was fine at that point, but he went into the kitchen and came back out to say the cook said that piece of beef was perfectly fine. THEN I was mad! In any customer service position, you dont argue with the customer. Esp. when the customer is not upset and doesnt want anything but is just telling you of a problem--so it doesnt happen again!Anyway, he did slightly make up for it by a) offering a free cheese course and b) bringing me the profiteroles which I had admired when going to another customer (they have cotton candy on top of them) and later another waiter offered me a moscatel with my dessert.However about the main course time, service started to not be very good. There were several times where they were busy cleaning up for the night rather than waiting on tables. It was disappointing, esp. in a restaurant which is expensive and supposed to provide stellar service.We also ate breakfast downstairs the next day and had disappointing service--very inattentive., First of all when we sat down they brought out a chair just for my girls purse!! She was super impressed!The Food was impeccable!! We had the Rabbit and the Veal and they were both amazing!The sommelier was very knowledgeable and actually worked for Thomas Keller at French Laundry in Yountville, California prior to working at Plume!!Bottom Line: This is one of the best dining experiences in Washington DC, We dined here tonight and sadly I have to agree with many of the other reviewers that the food is just not up to par with this caliber of restaurant especially if you have had some fantastic dining experiences. First we went to Quill, the bar, and got fancy cocktails for 15.00/drink. They were worth the price in my opinion. We headed over to the restaurant at 6pm for our reservation and were the first party seated. The service was absolutely impeccable and probably one of the best service experiences weve had yet. My water and wine glass never ran dry, not even half empty before it was refilled. There was some unusual pacing in that the first two courses came out back to back whereas there were huge gaps from the entree on wards. Our wine also took a bit of time to surface, and we managed to not see the sommelier until after our wine was delivered. Maybe it was just because they had just opened, but oh well. The appetizer course was okay. I had the hamachi tartar which had a distinct fishy flavor. I had to force myself to finish my plate, and I do like great sushi and sashimi so I do have a good expectation for what it tastes like. My husbands crab risotto was delicious and very flavorful. The portion was also quite plentiful. The bread was nice. There was a grain roll that was perfectly seasoned. The foccaccia was too salty however. Unfortunately, the biggest let down was the main proteins. My husband ordered the veal chop. He said that the veal was a touch underseasoned and that most of the flavor came from the sauce but there was not enough sauce. My dry aged beef was by far the biggest disappointment. I ordered it medium rare, and it was medium well. I realized this after the waiters had checked in, and had lost faith in the restaurant by this point. Although I am sure if I said anything they would have fixed it and more. By then, I already knew I wasnt coming back. My meat was perfectly seasoned but strangely lacking in flavor. For example, a few weeks ago I grilled a filet from Wegmans that had been dry aged. The homemade steak I made was far more flavorful than this steak which was drenched in sauce. My asparagus did not taste fresh and instead tasted like it was from a bag and microwaved. The truffle potatoes were quite delicious but I tend to prefer potatoes that have some texture to them. The cheese plate was good and desserts were phenomenal. I had the lemon three ways and the husband had a chocolate thing that was tasty. I cant remember the name. So, the long answer is the ambiance and service are top notch. The food is a major let down, especially if youve been to a place like Volt or equally as nice restaurants with high quality ingredients with top notch preparations., I am on a fine dining tear right now and decided to start with the exquisite Plume in the Jefferson hotel. It is quite small and extremely quiet Which sets the scene for a nice romantic dinner (which I had). The wait staff was amazing and very intelligent. We were given wines to meet our preferred pallet,they tasted as though they came from the heavens! We had not one hiccup with service or on presentation. Now for the wow factor which Plume certainly nailed (with the food not venue)... food was great but one of my dishes came out piping hot. I know I not getting into to much detail because I don like turning people off to a certain dish but this would be 5 stars if it didn cost me 300$ for 2 people when I have been to restaurants for half the price and with better ambiance!If you are looking impress a certain someone go here...but be careful because I think talking is almost frowned upon.Enjoy,BG, We have dined here four times now and just love it. The food was excellent and the wine pairings the highlight of our evenings. This meal really is about the wine!, I had an unforgettable anniversary dinner here. Make no mistake, this restaurant is very expensive and definitely for special occasions, unless youe loaded, or just demand the finer things in life...Some tips: If youe a guy, make sure you wear a suit. Otherwise you will look out of place. If you youe a girl, make sure you wear a dress. Otherwise you will look out of place. If youe there for a special occasion, like an anniversary, ask if you can have one of the more private tables when you make your reservation. While none of the tables are on top of each other, some are in little private alcoves which would be nice to have if you want added romance.The restaurant itself is beautiful. They spare no expense for the details. The details in the room moldings, the checkered floors, just a beautful hotel and a beautiful restaurant. Everything on the table was upscale and high-end. The flatware, the wine glasses, the fabric on the chairs, the napkins, even the fabric that covered the menus. Every detail in the restaurant was thought through, and it shows. Other reviewers have mentioned they bring a special chair or stool for women to put their purse on. My wife thought that was the greatest thing ever and very unique.The service was very, very, very good. The only thing keeping it from being perfect was there were sometimes too many people checking in on you. One person would come by and take your drink order, and then a minute later, another person would come by and ask if you wanted a drink order. Same thing with the food. A waiter would stop and ask how it was, walk away, and then another waiter would stop by and ask how it was. It was just a little disruptive, but nothing major.Before food, I have to mention the wine. They have a very impressive and extensive wine list here. The only thing to be prepared for is the price. There is not a whole lot of range here. Each type of wine had one bottle for like $60, and then quickly 10 for well over a $100, and then a few $500-$1000+. So basically, the wine is very expensive, but there is quite a variety there. As other reviewers have mentioned, the sommelier was previously at French Laundry in Napa. He was very friendly, and came by our table to talk about the wine we ordered and see how we liked it. He also gave us a few other recommendations to buy for home from the same winery, as well as some other restaurant recommendations. It was a nice talk.We went with the regular pre-fixe menu, which was pretty extensive. It $85, but you end up getting a decent amount of food. The first Amuse Bouche for the table, was a puff pastry filled with goat cheese. It was awesome. A second Amuse Bouche was different for my wife and I. Mine was a shot glass of gazpacho soup. It was very clean and fresh. Wee not entirely sure what my wife was. It was almost a miniature crab cake. Like a little bread ball, but the filling inside was mixture of pasta, and fish. Very difficult to describe, but it was easily once of the most delicious and flavorful items Ie ever tasted.For appetizers, we had the Heirloom Tomato Tasting and the Maryland Blue Crab Risotto. The presentation of the dishes is very pretty, and adds to the sophistication of the food. The tomatoes were fresh, clean and delicious, with a very nice pesto and olive oil mixture. The risotto was so soft and creamy and the crab was mixed in very well throughout.For Entrees, my wife got the Dover Sole, and I had the Lobster Thurmidor. Both were some of the most delicious plates of food Ie ever had. Dover Sole is delicious on its own, but this dish had an orange hollandaise sauce with it that was unreal. They should seriously bottle it and sell it, it was that amazing. I basically wanted to smother everything in that sauce.My lobster was also absolutely delicious. The lobster is cut in half and filleted, so there is no messiness while eating it. Each piece of the lobster is basically sitting a delicious well of butter, making each bite delicious. For added measure, the lobster comes with a side of potatoes, served in a nice little copper pot, kind of a cool little touch.As amazing as the entrees were, dessert may have been Plume shining moment. First, there was a pre-dessert drink given to us, a very nice dessert champagne. This was followed by a pre-dessert Guava ice cream with chocolate crisps, very refreshing.For actual desert, we had the Profiteroles and the Chocolate Tart. They were two of the most decadent, rich, and delicious desserts Ie ever had. The Profiteroles had freaking cotton candy on them! All I can really say is they were fantastic, some of the best desserts Ie ever had at any restaurant. To end the night, the staff cleaned our wine bottle for us to take as a keepsake, and also included a bag with a note stating what wine we had as well as a little bag of candies. This restaurant is fine dining, and helped make my anniversary one Il never forget. Simply a great dinner., My husband took me to Plume for our wedding anniversary. This American fine dining restaurant is located in the Jefferson Hotel and is easy to get to by Metro (Dupont Circle, Farragut North, Farragut West, etc.), if finding a parking spot for your car downtown is a bit tough. The restaurant does strongly prefer a jacket for men and a nice dress for women. Upon entering the restaurant, our first thoughts were that the interior--the gate in front, the chandeliers, the fireplace--were very pleasing to look at. The staff offered to have my coat taken and to put my purse on a stool. My husband ordered the tasting menu, and I ordered the tasting menu with the premium wine experience. We both enjoyed our food, and I enjoyed my wine, although some courses were better than others. I did not care much for the endive salad. The foie gras was perhaps the best that we have ever tasted. I also liked the lamb, although I usually do not like lamb. After so many courses of wine, I got a bit tipsy (I am a thin girl!), but I did not want that good wine to go to waste... We passed on the cheese cart, as our taste buds prefer cheapo cheese for some reason. Throughout the evening, the service from the staff was sophisticated and enjoyable, something that is a bit lacking in most other restaurants, even ones that call themselves fine dining. The food was good enough for me to request to my husband that he take me back to Plume in the near future so I can try their prix fixe menu., Admittedly, you pay through the nose to dine here, and then realize youe all in once you open the wine list. But man oh man, is this place good. No, this place is great. The food, service, and ambiance are all outstanding. One of the best dining experiences, and one of the best romantic dates, Ie ever had!! Felt like royalty. Oh, the fine print. Make sure to wear a suit if youe a guy, or youl be severly under-dressed. And note that the entire menu, at least on the Saturday night when we were there, consisted of varied Prix fixe selections -- starting at $85 per person, not including drinks, with substantially fancier options to choose from. But Il remember those flavors long after Ie forgotten what it cost., I dined here recently with a friend and found the dinner to be quite delicious. The experience and ambiance was amazing 5 stars for that, however, I just think the Prefixe menu could have had more choices. We were immediately brought an amuse bouche faux gras which I was not a fan of (just a texture thing) but I am sure it holds up to the test to even the most discriminating pallet. I then tried the Hamachi Tartar, I was a bit underwhelmed, I like my Tuna Tartar with avocado much better. Finally I selected the Dover Sole for my main entree. This was absolutely delicious, the texture and flavor was out of this world, especially for that of a mild white fish. My counterpart ordered the Lobster Thermidor, to my knowledge they were pleased and it looked exquisite. The service was of course top notch including a Sommelier even though I ordered a few cocktails (The French 76). They even brought out a lovely foot stool to set my clutch purse on.Following dinner came a plate of fresh berries with cream along with a plate of small chocolate dessert tastings. I mean really you cannot really complain about this place, but expect to be set back at least $300 for a proper dining experience. You should be wearing top-notch formal clothing or you will look like a real jerk. Just FYI., I had a lovely dinner here on Saturday with impeccable service. As noted in the other reviews, yes, this restaurant is very expensive. Be prepared to spend a lot of money. However, they certainly do not skimp on any aspect - decor, quality, ambiance, service. Take note that they only offer a Prix Fixe menu (starting at $85, to upwards of $1500 for the most upscale wine pairing). It is a bit of a slower pace of dining, but youre not here for a quick meal - ENJOY the experience. They are happy to accommodate special requests (for ex: our birthday boy wanted the cheese cart before our appetizers, which they happily did, and then brought the cheese cart again after entrees). STELLAR:GougeresSalmon amuse boucheWineCrab RisottoLobster ThermidorStriped BassDessertsLESS THAN STELLAR:mediocre bread (not warm, ordinary brown bread, I was really disappointed)Lamb was overcooked (both me and another person ordered it medium rare and it came out medium/medium-well) and underseasonedRabbit charcuterie was blandIN A NUTSHELL: great service, ambiance, experience, hit/miss foodGo for a special occasion, My boyfriend and I were recommended this restaurant for a romantic evening. The refined ambiance and posh demur made us feel as is we were back in NYC, mixed with a historical tone. The service was some of the best we have experienced and we never wanted for anything. We did not stay at the Jefferson hotel however the entry way was gorgeous and the restaurant contained so much detail. There were a few politicians present, some old money, and we were by far the youngest couple. The sommelier was extremely helpful and suggested a fantastic wine that went perfect with our opposite dishes. This is definitely a place to bring someone if youre looking to impress. Ill likely return. This restaurant is one of DCs most refined restaurants. Be prepared to spend some money. I suggest wearing a sports coat., Was there for dinner on Christmas. The decor was gorgeous and the service was very good even though a few missteps happened. For $100/person before drinks and tip, however, the food was a bit of a letdown. My steak was the biggest offender. It was unevenly cooked (was supposed to be medium rare) and too marbled. Was accompanied by boring lifeless asparagus and mashed potatoes. Something the chef could whip up on a regular Tue night in a hurry for his children. Their branded wine from CA, a Malbec/Syrah blend, wasnt good either. My companion enjoyed her foie gras and sole. Our carrot cheesecakes were unremarkable. Probably the best part of the meal were the complementary chocolates at the end. Will try it again but not wowed., Went for Christmas Day brunch with GFs parents as special occasion treat. Food decent and service good, but far from the superlative experience we expected (and paid mightily for). We were treated very nicely and glasses were kept filled, etc, but this occurs in many restaurants around town. Food was good, with occasional misfires--my medium prime rib had some well-done bits, and carrot cheesecake was unremarkable. Nothing to actually COMPLAIN about here but with expectations (and expense) so high were were hoping to be wowed., Went for Christmas day brunch with friends and family, and went in with very high expectations after reading the Washingtonian review and the Capitol File article. The setting is lovely; however we were placed in the outer room (had requested the room with the fireplace but got there early and no tables were available) and the outer room is definitely not the prime location. There was a lot of clanging of silver and dishes as the wait staff set up and readied for more guests, and the ladies in the group were not offered foot stools for the handbags. Hm... we wished we had waited for a different table.The food was quite good, everyone loved their prime rib; however, we consulted with the waiter about the wine and his recommendation was so-so. And no one was thrilled with the chocolate dessert - a dry, unremarkable brownie.The service was uneven - at times very attentive - but then we were totally ignored and had to ask another waiter to track down our server. And I had to ask twice to have my water glass refilled. I expect much better from a restaurant that been given a 4 star review.All in all, we enjoyed ourselves; but I felt like we got the B team as far as service went. And considering the cost of the meal - B team sevice doesn cut it., My best friend took me to Plume for my birthday and it was the perfect night! The decor, service, ambiance, and food were all fantastic. We enjoyed one of the tasting menus with a wonderful bottle of pinot noir recommended by the sommelier, who by the way definitely knows his wines. The chef accommodated by gluten-free request and went above and beyond -- he made gluten-free pasta just for me!This is a restaurant I will definitely be going back to. It is great for special occasions, but there is so much flexibility with the menu, that I would come back for dinner on a regular night as well!, Plume is a restaurant reserved for those special occasions. It is a very upscale, but still one of my favorite places in all of DC. The service and the food are always absolutely fantastic!, We had a wonderful early Valentines Day dinner here. It was recommended as one of the most romantic restaurants in DC, which I guess I didnt entirely agree with after dining there, but the meal was just fantastic.As most of already posted, its a Prix Fixe menu. We ordered the beet soup and the crab risotto for appetizers and both were amazing. Then scallops and striped bass for entrees - there were only two scallops on the plate, which I thought was a pretty small plate for the price, but the bass was quite large and delicious. We opted for the cheese selection as well and it was my favorite part of the meal. For $18 you get a ton of cheese. Dessert was a treat but not as wonderful as the service. Impeccable. By the time we had paid our bill they had lined up a cab for us and had our coats in hand. On the way out we were handed a small bag with chocolates in it as a thank you for dining with them.If you have a special occasion to celebrate, this is your place. Just be prepared to drop some serious cash., We arrived there just in time for the 9 PM reservation. My first time at the Jefferson Hotel it was a charming classic (not old fashion) hotel. Heard they spent $100 million on the renovation. On the other side of the entrances grille was the restaurant, Plume. Styled part in romanticism and classical there were painted murals on the wall and plush chairs they even offered me a little chair for my purse. The center table had a beautiful peacock silver ornament which my eyes were drawn to. I also liked the little bird ones at our table. The service was impeccable it reminded me of the higher-end restaurants in NY and in Europe, I would say that barely existed in DC. We started off with a Blanc de Blanc it was a nice dry and acidic champagne. They served nice hearty breads and warm choux at the table. The amuse bouche was a chicken liver pate with tangerine the liver pate was well prepared I didnt taste the minerally/iron flavor from the liver. The foie gras served with a small tiny peanut butterjelly sandwich was amazing! Didnt think that would be a good combination but it was great a bit of sweetness and nutty flavors combined well with the foie gras and the paired with the sauterne it was great! The only thing was the foie gras was produced too much oil. The veal ravioli with roasted whole salsify, grated parmesan cheese and green peas was a nice winter-spring dish. I like the slight char and nutty flavors from the salsify mixed with the savory meaty dumplings. The steamed sole served with a ratatouille tapenade reminded me of South of France, a ripen sweetness from the bell peppers and tomatos. There were also dots of herb sauce that gave the fish a punch. The highlight was the VA beef it was higher in marbling, it had such a flavor that contrasted with the usual iron heavy lean tenderloin - it was nicely balanced and tender. The pickled radishes gave the fatty beef some acidity. The cheese cart was amazing, again havent seen this except in the higher-end restaurants, we had a tasting of an array from the mild local goat cheese to the Camembert like soft cheese to the stinky epoisse to a blue vein cheddar. The cheeses were a great way to finish the savory portion of the dinner. The palate cleanser was a guava sorbet with passion fruit foam. It was very refreshing. The dessert was a chocolate panna cotta with hazel crumbles, orange sorbet and candied orange rinds - superb combination of the fruit, chocolate and nuts - all of the my favorite things in a dessert. The candied rinds were also very delicious. They even remembered to put a candle for my bf because it was his birthday celebration. After dinner we met with executive sous chef Ralf it was nice to have chat with him and saw the kitchen. The petite fours were a great way to finish off with some espresso. What a nice experience - thanks to the wonderful staff!!, Amazing! The decor was great and service was spectacular. One of the staff even ran outside to give us our complimentary chocolates! Food was great and I recommend the prime rib, which was so tender and flavorful. GO HERE!, EXCELLENT Went there friday for the 1st time.The food is fresh, staff very friendly and easy going,I had the salmon tartar Stuffed Artichoke Gratin and my boy friend had the Colorado Lamb A37ai (amazing)Dessert was excellentIll definitely return, The veal chop was cooked perfectly, one of the best Ive had and the service was stellar. The reason I could not give them 5 stars is because they never brought our to go box with half of a filet entree. My daughter, who was looking forward to eating this later, was so disappointed when we got back to the Palomar!, Do not miss the opportunity to visit Plume! We had a phenomenal experience!We went for my birthday and tried the tasting menu. We splurged a bit and did the tasting menu with premium wine pairings. Im glad we did as we were not disappointed!The sommelier, Michael, was wonderful and had also been recommended by a friend. He paired the wines beautifully with each course.We started the evening with complimentary cheese puffs and focaccia bread. A nice glass of Krug Grand Cuvee was poured to accompany the Amuse Bouche.The second course was a delightful foie gras medallion. Probably one of the best that I have tasted. Surrounding the foie gras was rhubarb, tarragon, green pepper, and strawberry. They paired it with a Zilliken riesling from Mosel, Germany (1992).The third course was a truffle risotto. The risotto was served with a slow cooked egg and shaved parmesan. Nothing is better than a nice pasta paired with a Louis Latour Grand Cru White Burgundy (2008)! Delicious!The fourth course was the Martins Angus Cote de Boeuf. This was thinly sliced beef which was cooked to perfection and served with a watermelon radish, shishito peppers, and a bordelaise sauce. It paired well with the Altesino Brunello di Montalcino (2007).Finally, we had the Red Fruit Vacherin. This was a unique dish of dried meringue, micro mint, raspberry, and vanilla ice cream. They were all incredible, but this was a perfect dish to end the meal. It was served with a perfect glass of Chateau dYqem Premier Cru Classe Sauternes (1998).We enjoyed the ambiance, the wonderful French decor, the service, and most of all the food. The price isnt for the faint-hearted, but we felt that it was worth every penny! They also had complimentary valet parking. Kudos to Plume! We cant wait to visit again., If I could give this place 10 stars I would. You cannot miss this place. Truly an unforgettable dining experience; the best of my and my husbands lives.We dined there for our 1st anniversary in 2011, and its still fresh in our minds as the best restaurant weve ever been to., The ambience was perfect. I had a great romantic date here! We were both a little bit shocked by the price but the overall experience was great. I loved the lemon dessert. That was by far the best one., Elegance defined. I cant remember when I have had a better dinner. The decor, the service, and the FOOD harken back to dinners from years gone by, dinners which you rarely find in this day of small plate, loud, rush in and eat in a hurry places.Prime aged filet with a truffle sauce I cant begin to describe. A wine list 70 plus pages long. This is our new defacto anniversary restaurant., Amazing as usual. I love Plume. The place is a little hard to find if youe not familiar with it. It across the street from the National Geographic building or better yet at the intersection of 16th and M St. If you know where Tabard inn is, it the next street over. Yes, this is a hotel restaurant. I personally have had really good experiences with hotel restaurants but some people take issue with it ... *Kanye shoulder shrug* The ambiance is fitting of the price. It is dimly lit, soft jazz like music plays in the background and there is a small army of wait staff buzzing around and available for your beck and call. Me and the Mr. were not feeling the tasting menu that night (it was an ode to Julia Child), so we did the prix fixe: amuse bouche, appetizer, entr39e, pre-dessert, and dessert. The amuse bouche that evening was a crunchy spring roll octopus salad. It was amazing and so flavorful. It was the perfect combination of sweet, salty, and savory, It tasted of hints of soy sauce, wasabi and octopus (which kind of tastes like calamari). Delicious. I had: crab risotto, duck breast, and chocolate palet.The crab risotto was tasty but not creamy. I don know why I expected it to be but I did and it was not, which was a little bit of a let down for me but it was still very good. There is hardly any crab on the dish so if youe ordering it for that, you may want to reconsider. The rice was cooked to perfection. It is also served with a topping of lobster foam. Overall tasty dish.. It offers seafood without being too fishy. The duck breast was very good and you get a lot of it, beautifully sliced up and sitting on a bed of apple chutney which is out of this world. Off to the side there is also a pat of chilled duck fat that has so much flavor when placed on top of the warm duck breast slices and scooped up with some of the apple chutney. I was not a huge fan of the dessert. The chocolate palet was kind of meh but the Mr. liked it a lot (he a chocolate fiend though, and if you are as well, and like the combination of chocolate, citrus, and raspberries, then this is all for you. It is semi-sweet, so again if you prefer your desserts to be not cloying, this is all for you. In retrospect, I think I should have tried the cr38me brulee. It was my first choice but a member of the wait staff steered me from it when he asked, Do you like salty desserts? It salty... The Mr. had: the duo, veal, and the chocolate tart. I can remember exactly the full title of the duo, but it was basically Plume take on tuna tartare. I don care for tuna tartare (I don really like fish) so I didn taste it but the Mr. loved it. The veal ... Omg. I like my duck but the veal was exceptional. Cooked to perfection and again apples were used in the sauce that decorated the plate. I did taste this and it was amazing. It took everything in me to keep myself from eating off the Mr. plate. The chocolate tart was meh, again. Semi-sweet chocolate that didn taste like much. My dessert was much better but still not so great. We did have wine with dinner. We ordered a pinot noir (called folk machine) that went very well with our meal and only cost $74. This was a steal. This place has crazily expensive wine and a very extensive wine list. It kind of fun to see a glass of wine being sold for $3,900 (it from the 1700!), but I have rent to pay and the streets aren calling. Pass. Its fun to go through the list though. I forgot to mention, the pre-dessert that night was mango sorbet served with solid white and milk chocolate.Very good, light and refreshing. Served almost as a palate cleanser so that you can dig into your dessert. I actually liked the pre-dessert better than my actual dessert.We finished off our meal with a marrocchino (like a cocoa espresso) and a cappuccino. Both were quite rich and tasty. The staff were lovely, personable, attentive and not one bit intrusive. Don worry about the place feeling too stuffy. Yes, it is formal (men should wear jackets but not necessarily a tie) but it somehow manages to feel laidback. Service with a smile. If possible get the library table. It gorgeous. It a table for two, that is tucked off to the side of the restaurant. It has books lining the walls behind it and a chandelier directly overhead. Definitely the most romantic table in the place. However, even when you request it, it of course, first come, first serve. We had a late reservation, so by the time we got there the table was taken :-(There is also a table in the corridor area that has a fountain. That seemed rather cute as well but the problem with that would be that you would have traffic as people pass you to go into the main dining room. We went on a Thursday at 8pm. It was very quiet.No matter what you choose you can lose. This place is amazing. 4 course dinner for two with a bottle of wine and espresso afterwards: app. $305. (gratuity not included), 4.5 stars.Celebrated a birthday dinner here and it was worth the prix fixe price of $89 (this may have gone up recently?). Essentially, we were served food non-stop in addition to our appetizer, entree, and dessert, making the entire meal a very filling one! It always feels great to get more than what you expect, even if its embedded in the prix fixe cost.My only concern is that the section we sat at, the secluded alcove that contains two tables and plants in the middle, had an insect or two flying around. Im sure it was the plants that caused this and it slightly diminished the overall experience. I wish we sat in the main dining area to avoid this, although the decor in the alcove was a nice touch., We really wanted our first anniversary dinner to be awesome so after much comparitive analysis we chose Plume. It was just OK. We did the prix fixe and the appetizers were great as was the amuse bouche. The entrees (lobster thermidor and lamb acai) came out lukewarm. I had the lobster and it was bland and very fishy... which is not good for lobster. The lamb was also a little bland but luckily it came with a sauce. The pre dessert was interesting - passion fruit sorbet and some caramel whipped cream. The salted caramel creme brulee was mealy and not creamy and tasted so-so. The palet of chocolate was huge and fruity... I guess it was ok. All in all, bill was 270 (thats 2 cocktails and 2 glasses of wine). The service was excellent but the food could have been better prepared. Well stick with what we know next time and go to Capital Grille or BLT Steak or Bourbon. Just sayin., I love the ambiance--this space is gorgeous! For that reason alone, its worth it for a special occasion, but I was disappointed after dining there with my husband to celebrate our 12th anniversary. The food was just OK. It was really a let-down. We went another time for brunch with out of town friends, and again, the setting was lovely. I feel like lunch might be a better bet than dinner, but I might give it another try nonetheless, because I really want to love it!, Five stars for the service alone. We started with drinks at Quill. Right at 8:25pm someone came to tell is our table was ready. What the heck??? Our reservation was for 8:30 pm. How did they even know we were at the bar when we didnt check in?? That was awesome. Spies everywhere in the hotel. Plume is gorgeous. The decor, ambiance and service made the experience even better. The food was well prepared and fresh. It was definitely good, but not sure if it matched its price tag. I would give it 4.5 stars. Would definitely come again. Oh, and the President was there the night we came. Secret service detail was all around. Must be the service :), An excellent meal. The tasting menu was stellar with almost perfect wine pairings. My only criticism of the wine pairings is that several of the premium pairing (twice as expensive) wines were not so special to me. The service was generally outstanding but seemed to fade out towards the end of the meal. Very expensive, but worth it for a top notch dining experience. If you can afford it, I recommend it as a great special occasion choice.Interestingly, the manager read my earlier review and contacted me. He said he he work to improve the consistency of service throughout the meal and talk to the wine steward about ensuring that the premium pairings were exclusive. Good follow-up! I will definitely dine at Plume again., I would contend Plume is the finest restaurant in Washington. An excellent old world ambience with careful Virginia touch, the best service in the city, and truly phenomenal cuisine, perched elegantly in the Jefferson Hotel. Very well done on every score. If you maintain particular requests (dietary or otherwise) they will keep a file of your preferences for next time, which gives you an indication of the seriousness with which they consider the full experience.Would strongly recommend dinner, two person seating near the fireplace. And do it right --full 3/5 courses with the right wine and after dinner drink selected. Ask for Paul. Formerly of the now-defunct Willard Room; the kind of waiter you follow as from one restaurant to another. Truly excellent service., Plume rising! Im a fan of 1789 in Georgetown and recently discovered this restaurant through a brief on-air appearance by the chef, who was interviewed while cooking a steak in a black iron skillet. Not bad indeed. Plume is located lobby-level just inside the entrance to the Jefferson downtown, so it is accessible to patrons with limited mobility (though do tell them in advance because seating is in any number of alcoves, some larger than others). The menu is not lengthy but the entrees include not-commonly-offered items like Lobster Thermidor (ever see how its made?) and veal breast. The desserts are turned out by a pastry chef and are built (!) to amaze. Between courses are little delights freely offered to cleanse and tease the palate. Dinner for two with two glasses of wine = just under $300 with tip so save your paper route money, youre gonna need it here but youll leave feeling like you had a visit back in your mothers womb: nurtured and nourished and loved and warm and carefree and happy. And the tables are reeeally prettily arranged; mine had a silver-y peacock perched on it. For the ladies, they proffer little upholstered tuffets upon which to rest ones purse.
56|quill-washington|Unlike the W Hotels Bar which was an utter disaster its opening week, youd think the wonderful Quill bar, which opened Monday inside the historic Jefferson Hotel, had been serving top shelf cocktails for years. The staff is one of the most professional and knowledgable Ive seen at any DC establishment. And for the price of the cocktails, they should be. I paid $15 dollars for a specialty drink. That said, it was incredible. The decor is a great mix of classic antique with small touches of modern. Honestly, I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. The only thing that bugged me was the music. And honestly, it was sort of a big deal. This place is so classy and in such a great old hotel...they were playing lame backbeat lounge-music, like what youd hear in a porn film or in a shopping center. They should go all out and play something older or at least classier. Ah well...., 3.5 stars.I met up with a friend for cocktails at Quill on an unpleasantly cold evening a few weeks ago, as I had been eagerly looking forward to doing ever since reading on metrocurean about its upcoming opening.While awaiting his arrival, I decided to let the bartender have a go at mixing me something up under the guise of the cocktail menu Master Mind bartender choice. It is interesting that lots of cocktail bars are trying their respective hands at this concept, especially as it seems that not too many of them are particularly adept at it. You have to be a *really* great bartender to take down a patron likes and dislikes and come up with a great cocktail. The bartender at Quill proved to be no exception.I recently been reading about a new concept in cocktailing (not a word) regarding smoking water and ice for drinks (nytimes.com/2008/11/30/f206). I wasn expecting this at Quill, but that and the cold weather got me thinking about having something smoky and warming. When I relayed this to the bartender, I admit that I was thinking Guyanese rum. Why didn I just tell her this? I not sure. I think I wanted her to know what to make without my telling her, considering that this cocktail was going to be $15, and she had been deemed a master. I believe my other preferences noted were citrus but not fruity/beachy.Out came a cocktail of spiced rum and fruit juice. I going to try not to assume that the spiced rum was Captain Morgan. Not only was there zero nuance, it just wasn interesting; it also wasn a great way of showing off a talented bar staff (if that was the goal).By this point my friend arrived, and despite my swearing it off on the principle of reason, we ended up ordering the $18 turkey club on principle of starvation. Lest you think this decision outrageous, consider the alternative $23 burger. That right. $23.The club itself was...a turkey club. However, Quill homemade ketchup that accompanied the fries was the best Ie ever tasted. I not sure what they put in it, but dang - delicious.As an intermission to our cocktail ordering, my friend asked to try some of their featured homemade infused liquors. The bar manager graciously brought over the bottles and shot glasses for us to taste the two on deck: pineapple and ginger infused rum and strawberry, mango, and black pepper infused vodka. The vodka was the clear winner, but we sipped on both until they were gone. I had read elsewhere that the employees of Plume (The Jefferson restaurant) didn know quite when to walk away from the table, and that certainly rang true with the bar manager. He was quite nice as he explained their liquor infusion process, but after about ten minutes, the details became a bit overbearing.My final cocktail of the evening was the Dry Pepper Martini. Despite its ingredients of Hendrick, dry vermouth, simple syrup, black pepper, and rose oil, it tasted mostly of rose (no complaints here - I like very floral cocktails). It was quite a pretty drink (replete with floating pansy), but after a few sips, the strength and sweetness of the drink became somewhat overwhelming. It tasted nice, but it wasn completely balanced. I believe it took me a good hour to finish it, at which point I, too, was completely finished for the night.All in all, I glad I marked Quill off my list of bars to try, but I left somewhat disappointed. I not sure I would go back specifically for the cocktails. That said, the ambiance is quite nice, very quiet, and very grown up. I should also offer as a final note that a hotel manager gave my friend and me a brief tour of Plume and the downstairs of the newly renovated Jefferson, and it was all really quite charming and sophisticated. Too bad the drinks didn completely follow suit., I met up with a friend for cocktails here last week. I had never even heard of the Jeffferson much less Quill, but was excited to meet up with an old friend. As soon as my boyfriend and I walked into the place, I was taken back. Not only were we greeted right away to check our coats by a friendly staffer, but we were lead into the bar. I stepped outside to enjoy a cigar on the patio while my boyfriend ordered drinks. I asked him for a glass of malbec or merlot, and the bartender had him bring out my taste of wine before pouring the rest of the glass. While that seemed a bit over the top, the gesture was very appreciated. The atmosphere itself is a unique blend of old world aristocratic and LA glam. The orange lit bar juxtaposed against wooden panels, bookshelves, a piano, and private side rooms is just enough to give the room a feel of level headed sophistication without overwhelming your senses. There was also a gentlemen playing the piano that evening, which I thought was wonderful. The cocktails! Alex is an excellent craftsman for cocktails, and I was impressed by both his finesse with the making and pouring, and the creativity in which he concocted custom libations for his guests. He talked about his infused liquors with ease and avoiding being overbearing, which is difficult to do sometimes. The pepper infused vodka is a must try, its really excellent. The side rooms are an excellent addition. My party escaped the bar to one of the side rooms after enjoying the bar for a while, seeing a quieter atmosphere. The couch was comfortable, the noise level was perfect, and a server came back to periodically check on us. The only thing that we werent too happy about was the bill. There was a mix up and our bill was combined with someone elses, and we didnt realize it until the next day upon review. My boyfriend decided not to contest the charges with the hotel, but promises to be more careful about reviewing things before slapping down the plastic. So check your bill carefully before paying. These things happen. All in all. Cant say enough good things about Quill. I will most certainly be back., Gorgeous. Simply gorgeous. From the beautiful decor, to the great service and incredible drinks, this place is it. A coworker and I had coupons for a free cocktail and decided to check it out. And I now have a favorite posh cocktail spot. At $15 a pop for the speciality cocktails, its not a regular place, but if you need to impress someone (date, client, someones parents) or want to treat yourself, its completely worth it. I had the pineapple, ginger and prosecco, which was fantastic. The ginger is a brilliant edition, as it keeps the drink from being too sweet and spring break-ish. And even though we were using our coupons, the charming Italian bartender could not have been more attentive and treated us better. They even brought us a completely plate of olives and wasabi dusted nuts. So good. The hotel is sort of in a no-mans land: not really Logan Circle, not really Dupont, not really downtown, but thats hardly their fault. I now have a new favorite bar., 4.25 I think. My new favorite hotel bar. Its definitely pricey, but Ive yet to see a hotel bar that wasnt overpriced so it comes with the territory. The decor is beautiful, cozy, and elegant. The cocktails are fantastic. They use great fresh fruit ingredients and interesting alcohol bases. The purple haze was delicious though I didnt really get the black pepper flavor of the strawberry/mango/pepper vodka. The ginger, pineapple, prosecco is light and refreshing, and the ginger and pineapple are perfect complements to each other.Cocktails come with wonderful bar snacks: large green olives, gourmet mixed nuts, and assorted pickled veg. The food from the menu comes in tiny portions. The cheese plate was very average. The spinach and mushroom ravioli, on the other hand, were lovely and delicate, and we wound up ordering a few more plates of it. My favorite food item was actually one of the bar snacks--the pickled white asparagus. I always wind up asking them to bring more of those.The service was generally good. Theres a large number of servers floating around, and all were helpful and uniformly attractive. Eye candy central! However, despite there being so many servers, it was sometimes hard to get the attention of one. Since Quill is a snug space and theres practically a 1:3 ratio of servers to customers, Id expect greater attentiveness from the servers., I could tell you about the space: bordering on opulent, this elegantly restrained interior is very much hush-hush DC. Need to tell a cohort a secret? Come here. Want to get rowdy? Please dont.I could tell you about the gratis bar snacks: pickled vegetables (white asparagus!) and bright green olives and plenty of mixed nuts.I could tell you about the staff: buttoned up, happy to serve. If you have a question, any question, they will endeavor to answer it. Even if it requires research. Trust.But it all really comes down to the: Americano. Perfect. Made me remember how much I love Campari and the classic cocktails that contain it., You gotta be kidding me: Pretentious, cramped and unfriendly. Oh yeah, throw in ridiculously expensive. This is everything that is wrong with DC....in a very small space., The first thing you notice about Quill is its opulent space in the Jefferson Hotel. It is all leather and dark wood and seduction. The second thing you notice about Quill is the beautiful piano and lively piano player, which adds another element to the sultry atmosphere. The third thing at Quill, you do not notice, you pounce upon: each table comes with the most amazing green olives Ive ever had and a huge bowl of salty, mustard-flavored mixed nuts that even the most ardent nut lover could not devour in an hour of non-stop munching.Quill has an excellent cocktail list with homemade infused vodkas. But I think wine is the way to go. They have an extraordinary wine list (ask for the full restaurant list from Plume). You simply cant miss on this list. They have all the big names in all sizes from every region of the world, but the list is balanced with a number of good values. It may be the most thoughtful wine list Ive ever seen. We went with a half-bottle of white burgundy from Meursault that was excellent and then had another half-bottle of red burgundy from Volnay that was also quite good. Dinner was also excellent. I loved the mini-burgers, but the fried chicken was even better. Quill was a bit of treat (ordering two half-bottles of wine), but well worth it. The service this time around was top-notch. Cant wait to go back!, So 3 stars may be a little unfair to Quill, but given my ongoing love affair with cheeseburgers, I couldnt justify any higher. It may be more accurate to say that this is a 4 or even 5 star restaurant that was brought down by a mediocre burger and some sad french fries. Lets start with the good, then well get to the burger itself. The Quill is the bar attached to the Jefferson Hotel in Washington, DC. It is two oak paneled rooms featuring a beautiful grand piano, understated art on the walls and a very well-stocked bar. In warm weather - though not sweltering as it was when I was there - french doors open onto a nice patio looking out onto 16th street. I had just gotten off plane that had been diverted from BWI to Dulles and back again and I felt I deserved something nice for my troubles. I wanted upscale and I got it here. I had a rosemary green-tea infused martini that was just perfect and unwound while the pianist played old standards in the background. It was very mad-men-y, but also extremely relaxing. While I was looking for upscale, I was also looking for something that wouldnt break the bank, hence the burger. Though for $21, I was expecting fireworks. It was advertised as a dry-aged sirloin burger with house-made ketchup, smoked bacon and aged cheddar cheese, but I was offered a choice of blue or cheddar cheese (I ended up going with blue, but more on that later) and when it arrived there was a small bottle of Heinz ketchup to go along with it and no bacon. Not a big deal, but when youre told youre going to get something, you kinda expect it to be there, especially when its bacon and more especially given that after a martini, a glass of wine, the burger, tax and tip ended up being over $70.The burger itself wasnt bad, just under seasoned. You couldnt really taste the meat and it was completely drowned out by the blue cheese. As I said, I ordered the blue cheese, which was brilliantly pungent and really very good, so that part is on me. What was really the downfall of the burger was the brioche bun. Ive read a number of other people complain about brioche with burgers and never really got what the big deal was until now. The sweet flavor just didnt go with the meat.The fries were a cop out, they were under done, limp and just sad. Not much else I can add to that.Based on what others were eating, I clearly made a poor choice, the rest of the food looked great, and Im sure that it is. That said, if you have a burger on the menu, its going to be representative of the rest of your menu to some people (ie. me) and it should receive the same attention as any other dish you serve a guest. Long story short: Go for a super cocktail, the food maybe good too (not the burger obviously). Just be prepared to break the bank., A nice, refined piano bar in the Jefferson Hotel. Nice location and a great hotel, too.The service here was very good. I received expert guidance on their signature cocktails and chose the pisco cocktail (with horseradish?). Believe me, it was tasty yet disturbing to my taste buds. Sometimes you just have to shake things up, right?Very extensive wine list--especially if you like Pinot Noir. A nice sized pour.Bring your AmEx here, though. It is pricey!, We fell in love with this gorgeous place!Service & food exceptional! (Cocktails, Salmon Mouse & the Lamb just lovely!)But the best part by FAR is the amazing talented Peter Robinson! He plays the piano beautifully, his voice is beautiful and his deep belly laughs and entertaining conversation make this place worth visiting DC for!!! Made our evening very special thanks guys! We eagerly await Peters CD!, Gorgeous hotel. Beautiful bar. Went there for drinks with a friend. Funny that we had to wait for the Seagrams for the seven & seven. But, my double bourbon was just dandy!, I have no idea what everyone is so on about this place. the bartender didnt know what an east India cocktail was, for pitys sake. After trying to explain it to him three times I gave up and ordered an old fashioned. The place is full of pretentious Washington suits congratulating themselves for having handed John Boehner a hand towel once back in 05. When my drink finally came out (he looked up the east India) it was mediocre to poor. And it cost $14. Meh. Go to the Gibson., I trying to think of ways to describe Quill without mentioning that it is a *superb* setting for a sexy role play, and I just can do it.I mean, the plush chairs, dim lighting, classic American dark wood all just scream UNLEASH A NEW IDENTITY AND SPICE UP YOUR LOVE LIFE TONIGHT! Or maybe that just me. The cocktails were amazing, as one would hope they be for $15. I got the lemongrass gimlet with vodka (as I reserve gin for spring/summer), and R got the Manhattan. We exchanged drinks momentarily and I concurred that the Manhattan was all bourbon. I think they have their spring cocktail menu out, but I thought the gimlet was a great winter drink, soothing on the throat on a cold night. The ambiance is very nice, but something was missing for me, so this review is actually a 3.5 star one. Some of the other reviewers have touched on the patronage, who are quite laughable, but I think it was they that made the place not as cozy as it could be. Of course, there was the token married guy with the woman who was so OBVIOUSLY not his wife (we guessed she was a model, in the Mad Men season 2 sense, if you catch my drift) and the too-old-for-LNS-but-not-quite-old-enough-for-Cosmos-Club troupe. Hil-arious, but not down to earth at all. There was a guy playing standards on the piano, til the standards turned to Neil Diamond I think. I was well confused, but a piano playing in a bar is quite nice.One note: the bar closes at midnight, and our server made sure to let us know this several times (we were aware of it, so that was fine). They let those of us at the bar linger after 12, but said that they were no longer serving...until two couples showed up and ordered food and all! (Guess the bar stays open if you pay to keep it open, R said. Did appear that way.)So, in conclusion, the drinks were great, the patronage is a little ridiculous, and the bartenders were nice. We come back, but only when wee so rich that we wear clothes made of $100 bills and don care what anyone would say if we got drunk, leaned on the piano, and sang along. Oh, but we do have it bookmarked in case we ever lose that lovinfeelin Definitely do., Stopped by the other day for drinks. This is a tiny little place in a beautiful hotel. The place is small an cozy and service was fantastic!I ordered some wine and somehow it felt that the bottle had been sitting open for sometime and I mentioned that to my friends. The hostess apparently overheard us and the manager came over and offered to pour me a new glass! Now that is service :)They do have a good selection of wines and their cocktails were excellent too.I wish the place was bigger - minus 1 star for that :(Definitely a place to go to again., Occasionally you come across a place that really embodies the spirit of a city. When youre there, you feel completely connected to the greater environment that youre in, and you know that that feeling is unique to that city and no other. DC, for me, is some combination of politics, power, history, mystery, formality, and opportunity. Thats what Quill feels like. Its the quintessential DC old-school bar. Lots of wood, cocktails, people in suits, a humidor, and just an overall great atmosphere. It shouldve felt stuffy, but it didnt. It was great.The district occupies a special place in my soul. I doubt Ill have a reason to live there again, but places like Quill remind me why I keep coming back., Quill takes everything that you thought you knew how to do well as an amateur cocktail craftsman and shows you not only how it done professionally, but perfectly. By my account you won find any crazy concoctions trying to stray far outside the lines of traditional cocktail thought, but you will find some of the most well balanced drinks that do throw in a few handmade ingredients to liven up old favorites. While my first visit here, the Quill Cocktail Competition (3rd in the semi-annual series, featuring Tequila Ocho) was basically an excuse to visit the bar I had long wanted to try, it did give me a great preview of the space and the staff and make me long for more.The most notable of my recent visits back to Quill came after a typically wonderful dinner put together by Julia at Sichuan Pavilion with a large group of other Yelpers. We feasted until we could not take any more, and then a few of us walked the couple blocks over to Quill to cleanse our palates at the hands of the ever adept Erin. The drinks here aren cheap ($15 apiece), but neither is the hotel, and this is one place you get what you pay for. We took up a seat at the bar, already having previewed some of the drinks we wanted to order, and were then surprised to see the menu had just changed 2 days prior. Erin told us she actually thought this new menu was the best Quill had put out, and after sampling almost all of it I have to say it definitely doesn have a weak spot.When you cozy up to the beautifully lit bar you can choose from what they call reinvented classics, or new creative ideas, along with a special seasonal pairing. Like many of the new trendy cocktail bars they also have what they call Mastermind creations, where you briefly describe what youe looking for and bestow your trust upon the bartender to come up with something totally unique for you. I bounced around the menu a bit this night, and wound up with 3 very rewarding, all very unique experiences, as well as trying a bit of everyone else. Il let Jelila tell you more about her Mastermind creation, a blend of passion fruit puree and the jalapeno infused Bombay Sapphire which was one of the most harmonious drinks Ie ever sipped from, and Julia can give you a better recounting of her indulgence with the Summer seasonal pairing, called Amaro Dulce, an incredibly unique pairing of Luxardo Fernet Amaro, House Made Vanilla Syrup, Gine Floraison Gin, which is served with pickled herring and candy striped beets. My drinks were slightly less adventurous, by comparison, but I think they wound up being the best of the bunch, at least for my tastes.My first selection was about as close to kismet as Ie ever seen on a cocktail list, the Sapphire On The Bayou, a seemingly simple blending of cucumber, tonic water and jalapeno infused Bombay Sapphire. The pairing of my favorite gin with one of my deepest loves, spicy foods, was wholly irresistible. There is another drink at The Getaway (bit.ly/ooR6j6) in Columbia Heights this reminded me of, except this trades the sweetness of mango puree for a much spicier jalapeno pepper (instead of the Serrano they use). It also had a much more potent alcohol kick, as the gin percentage was quite high, always a positive for me. Every now and then I would get feint hints of the cucumber, a nice refresher and reminiscent of a Summer breeze while down on a sweltering Bayou.Up next I went for the Raspberry Pimm Cup which features fresh muddled raspberries, mint leaves, Pimm No. 1,and Fever Tree Bitter Lemon. This drink is just damn delicious, although I have to say it not my favorite Pimm drink in the area. I still think Againn (bit.ly/oC00Cy) holds the crown here, with this one coming in second just ahead of PS7 (bit.ly/q1N3bb). The raspberry I actually found to be a better fruit additive than strawberry for this drink, as the seeds are smaller and it muddles much better, as well as providing more of a tart flavor over sweet, always a good thing for me. The mint was also the freshest I have ever had in a drink, almost as if it came from an herb garden on the premises. The only real disappointment here, and why Againn just barely nudged it out, is the somewhat lack of alcohol flavor that exists...it just not there.I finished up the evening with what turned out to be my favorite cocktail of the entire night, and easily in the top 5 drinks Ie had in all of DC, the St-Germain Sazerac, made with lemon juice, St. Germain Liqueur, Peychaud Bitters, and A. de Fussigny Cognac. There is no denying the alcohol presence here and yet the drink just tastes so damn phenomenal. The bright acidity and latent sweetness pair so well together, and taking a bite of one of the accompanying cherries and then sipping just takes it to a transcendental level., Quill is a divine treat that wel reserve for anniversaries and other special occasions. We visited late on a friday night for an after-dinner drink. The singer at the piano played just the right standards at just the right volume so that we could enjoy both the music and our conversation. I am removing one star for the drastically overpriced menu of half bottles of wine. We were familiar with some of the wines on the menu and noticed that Quill was charging a whole bottle price for half the bottle (or in our case, a whole bottle price for just one glass). But I have to admit, the Oregon pinot noir we chose was undeniably delicious. You definitely pay for the ambiance and exclusivity here, but it worth it. Our guess is that they keep the prices high to keep the crowd small and intimate. It works. If you want to romance your partner, this is definitely the place. The plush, cozy ambiance just begs you to stay. I floated away feeling like I was in a movie. Can wait to go back, preferably on a cold winter night. Exquisite., I probably going to be extremely biased because I got to sit out on their patio IN THE MIDDLE OF NOVEMBER to enjoy a couple of cocktails. That right. Patio. November.You know what else? November. Fall drinks.I started with a pumpkin margarita because really, where else are you going to start? It was pleasant, although I tasted more ita than in. The salt on the rim was a little much, but once you get through the first sip, you can carve out a little lip spot.Next up was the Jefferson Cider, which while warm, was perfect for that evening.What really tickled my fancy was the Master Mind, or I tell you booze and stuff, and you make it, only it actually listed on the menu that you can do that instead of being a bossy jerk. I said pumpkin stuff, dark rum, and vanilla. Those were my parameters. He said they sounded pretty good. He tossed in some chocolate bitters (didn know they existed) and the final product was HEAVEN. I love my pumpkin stuff, and this was right up my gourd alley.Not so much up my gourd alley were the prices (they are pretty steep), but the warm fall night and the pleasant (oh who am I kidding, but goddamn we had fun) company was worth it., A friend asked me out to join him and a couple of others for a cognac and cigar tasting. What I got was much better! Turns out my friends girlfriend works in PR and we got a private tour of some of the hotel.The night started at Quill, a low-key but swanky cocktail bar. We sat on the outdoor patio and each had three glasses of cognac coupled with a nice medium-bodied cigar. The service was top-notch. We got the low-down on the cognac and the cigars we had the privilege of trying.After some good conversation, we moved on into the hotel lobby where we learned more about the Jeffersons history including the real letters written by Thomas Jefferson on the walls, the conference room with windows that go dark for when Obama visits, the dining room center pieces from Europe in Plume, etc.It was cool to be in the presence of such great history.Pros: Good drinks, awesome glass bar, top-notch serviceCons: noneOverall, a great place to have a drink on a friday or saturday night., I have a certain standard when going to these types of places. Fining dining prices would usually associate with find dining food. Now, I am not say that Quill did not have some fine dining items, but for what I got and what I paid didnt match up in my opinion.I came here with Heather G. and Carly C. for a girls night happy hour before I attended a concert at the DAR Constitution Hall. They had arrived about an hour prior to me getting there and already had a drink. I wasnt in the mood for alcohol, so I settled for the dinner menu instead. The dinner menu has appetizers, sandwiches, and fine dining entrees all ranging from $9 to $38. Thats a pretty wide scale for stuff you can get. All signature drinks were $15, and I just couldnt come to terms with paying for a drink that would match up to the same price as my meal -- hence why I decided against it. Not saying that next time I wont shell out the cash, just this particular night I wasnt feeling it plus I had to drive. Carly C. mentioned her drink was probably 3x as strong as your typical cocktail. If that is truly the case, then $15 is reasonable. Just think of it as 3 drinks in 1 for $5 a piece. For my dinner I got the half soup / half sandwich. My half sandwich was the lobster curry while my soup was a cauliflower base something. I cant remember, it was some fancy name though. Both were really good, but after only eating Ramen noodles earlier in the day for lunch (I am in need of going to the grocery....) and that being my sole meal, I was needing something more. The portion was a bit small for $19. Both were good and paired nicely together.After the meal, we all decided on desserts. By this point Heather G.s guy friend showed up and joined in on the festivities. I started out with the creme brulee which turned out to be a total mix disaster. It just wasnt prepped right. It was a mango sorbet with very non traditional custard, and cranberry stuff on the bottom of it. It was more like a parfait than a creme brulee. When I told my server about my thoughts, she happily swapped it out with something different. I took her recommendation of the carrot cheesecake. Once again, this dessert was alright -- but definitely sounded better on paper than what it tasted. By this time I was pretty full and could have been I just wasnt into it at that point. I will admit that.Service was great. We had a man come by every so often to fill our waters, the manager stopped by to see how we were, and our server Kristen was very nice and assisting. Overall, I think this place was okay. I like the intimate ambiance and the food is pretty good. If they made some minor adjustments this would definitely be a solid 4 stars. Right now I will give it a 3.5., Located inside the beautiful Jefferson hotel, my expectations for Quill were high from the start. After being personally escorted to the bar by one of the receptionists at the main entrance of the Jefferson, it was already looking like to start of an evening of pampering service and the highest quality refreshments and treats. For the most part, Quill more than surpassed my idea of a bar geared toward high society. Apart from a few less than perfect offerings, I would put Quill on the top 5 list of best bars.Seated at the bar I was introduced to my first bartender of the evening, Frank. I asked him to just make me something based with bourbon. To no surprise of mine, Frank decided on a classic old fashion. Good choice. Im not going to claim that I know everything there is to know about bourbons or old fashions, but I can say with great confidence that the cocktail was deliciously balanced and pleasing. I was mostly surprised at how strong it was while still going down smoothly. It lasted me almost an hour without seeming to get diluted at all. Wow.While waiting for Heather G. to arrive (finding the best parking is a little difficult for the first-timer), I was asked by Frank if I would like to hold a table. This way we wouldnt lose the option of moving after the bar got too crowded and all the tables would be full. Really? A bartender who actually tends to your future needs as well as your immediate? Yes please. Heather G. got there only 15 or so minutes later, and we stayed at the bar long enough to sip away most of our cocktails, and munch half the bar nuts and olives before we told the new bartender Adrian we wanted to move to our table. He quickly informed us that he would move our drinks and what not for us, then escorted us to our new table. Heather G. and I were a little fussy after it appeared we wouldnt be getting the bar munchies back. We watched a runner take them back to the kitchen after we sat down. It caused some blushing after the runner brought back full bowls of mixed nuts and olives for us. Lesson learned.As soon as Mary Kate A. made it to Quill, we put in our orders for dinner. This is where I believe they a little short. The kitchen is not up to par with the bar, and although you will be paying equally for both, you will not be getting the same quality; especially when it comes to desserts. Kind of disappointing, but honestly I wont mind still going there for drinks and just eating dinner somewhere else. Its worth the minor inconvenience of traveling. Overall, Quill is a fantastic place when you need a quality drink and perfect service. Even though the parking is a little tough, and the kitchen menu is everything you would expect from a hotel restaurant, once you relax into the cozy atmosphere and have one of the artfully prepared cocktails, you wont have a care in the world for anything else. Next time I make it out I will be sure to try one of the more outlandish cocktails off their menu. I trust all of them will be suburb., Expensive but well worth it. A jewel of a bar with incredible drinks and a laid-back atmosphere. I really enjoyed the jazz pianist., All I can say is, it was exactly what I expected. I went with my wife and some friends on the night before Thanksgiving. I was looking for a quiet place with good drinks and a mellow atmosphere. There was maybe eight people in the place including the four of us. Jonathan the bartender kept us entertained and the ladies loved the cup cakes. Kudos to the pastry chef and the mixologist (HA! inside joke) . Hope to be back soon.Jason, Love it. Delightfully cozy, the hotel as a whole has a wonderful feel with little nooks and crannies to sit and relax in. The Quill fits in with the over all feel, classic wood labeling and leather seats have been given an updated feel as the bar itself is a tactile glowing orange focal point, giving of a warm welcoming light.Now to the really important stuff, you get complimentary olives, nuts and pickles which is always a nice touch, the cocktails were yummy and about average price for this kind of establishment in this area ($15 each). We went on a friday, which is Fry Day at the Jefferson, they celebrate their name sake by offering delicious French fries for $2. They were yummy.Service was a tiny bit slow, but Ill be bac k for special occasions and when I want a treat., Very cute restaurant/bar hidden in the Jefferson hotel. The food is a little over-priced, but the atmosphere is worth the extra bucks. Service is fantastic. This is a great spot take out-of-town guests you would like to catch up with over a quaint meal., Thank you guys at the Quill for a great!!! How-To video demonstration on how to make a Fresh Orange Caipirinha recipe. Its delicious and our viewers love it!hispanic.com/food/drinks206Hispanic.com, Quill is a cozy bar tucked inside the The Jefferson Hotel. It is dimly lit and has a variety of comfy seating. Definitely an upscale setting. A great place to get your drink on before a nice dinner. Possibly a great place to get a bit romantic and flirtatious. They have a great wine list and are supplied with the glasses, liquor, and mixes to make all of your favorite concoctions. I enjoyed a Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier., Quill is my absolute favorite bar in the city. Its a great place to take out of town friends or to just grab a drink solo. The drinks are unique and so delicious. The outside patio is also a great place to hang out and take in the city. The bar menu is also very good in case you get hungry. They make the best Pimms cup ever!, The gf and I brought a group of cocktail loving friends to Quill for drinks. The two-room bar is divided into two different but equally well-appointed spaces. The front area is a quaint lounge outfitted with a grand piano. We were there early on a Saturday evening likely before the live music started. The second room houses the actual bar, which was all wood, modern with an art deco feel, dimly lit but the backlit bottles of fine spirits were immediate eye-grabbers. I started off with the Bitter and Boozy made with Goslings Black Rum, cognac, and Averna amaro. It was bitter and boozy, yet exceedingly well balanced, and very satisfying. For my second round, I had my favorite standby (and acid test for a good bar), a Sazerac. My drink was made flawlessly. I didnt see how he made my drink, but without a doubt, it was the best Sazerac Ive had outside of New Orleans and certainly the best rendition in DC. Drinks at Quill are pricey at $15 a pop, but I felt like I got what I paid for. Despite our groups size, approx. 15 people, the two bartenders efficiently made our groups cocktail orders maintaining their friendly, professional demeanor throughout the night. If youre looking for a well-made drink or a glass of a top shelf spirit, neat, in a seriously classy setting, then look no further. Quill in the Jefferson Hotel is for you., Foie gras burger? Delicious cocktails? Civilized service with a smile? Quill bar at the Jefferson is such a welcoming intimate bar that I dont want the world to know how much I love it there. 2 burgers plus 3 cocktails was $98, but well worth the experience of a world class non-fussy romantic date., Whenever I travel to D.C. I love to stop here for drinks and olives, of course. The bar is a swanky, dark, cozy and plush place tucked inside the beautiful Jefferson Hotel. The last time I went here with several people and we were very well attended to. Will be back!, 15$ cocktails that adequate and entirely worth the rather elegant bar. Excellent for a significant date or group of friends. I wouldve tried food but we had reservations for dinner elsewhere., Quill served up a flawless experience from start to finish. Quill is truly a sophisticated and classy place. Even though it is located in a hotel it is well separated and if you went in the quill entrance you wouldnt know a hotel existed beyond the walls of the bar. The bar is dimly lit and features dark wood and leather. There was also a live piano player. Swoon. Unlike many of the other popular cocktail spots in town Quill is completely not hipster. My friend and I might have been the youngest of the crowd there. There are some small alcoves which would be perfect for small groups. The service at Quill is really what you want from any place. The bartender asked us what we liked and out of our completely unsophisticated responses told us he would whip something up for the each of us. Not only were the cocktails obscenely delicious, they seemed to match each of our personalities and tastes perfectly. How did he know?? I got a bourbon drink with hints of sage and lavender with egg whites to create a frothy effect. My friend had a more stiff drink with bourbon and some type of citrus that was perfectly suited for her. We were in heaven! In addition they brought out a large portion of nuts and olives to snack on. This cost us a pretty penny at $15 dollars a cocktail but Ive never been so pleased to pay so much for so little before. I couldnt stop smiling as I left the bar. I dont know if it was the bourbon, the live music or that I had felt like a princess for the last hour., Cozy setting... and one of the best martinis Ive ever had. I dont think the drink was pricey at all., Peter on the piano has an endless collection of the classics from the 30s, 40s, and beyond. I could listen to him every night as he seamlessly goes from conversing with the guests into a new set of lyrics. The Jefferson and Quill define class and distinction and the beverage list is as good as it gets., Another fantastic evening spent in Quill! I absolutely love the cocktails and the very high quality of the liquors and mixers that go into making them. The after dinner drink selection is wonderful too. The staff sets an example of the height of professionalism and is very knowledgeable, and the ambiance is intimate and relaxing. The wine selection is my favorite in the city. If the wine list was a person Id be dying to hang out with them. It is quirky and eclectic yet sophisticated and well rounded. Thank you for including a Sancerre Rose by the glass! Love the little green olives they bring to the table, and the very charming and personable piano player. The night we went to Quill the small crowd there was having a fabulous time singing along to show tunes and jazz favorites being played on the piano. All of this came together to really offer up the perfect combination for a quiet yet enjoyable night out. You cant find anything better in the area if this is the kind of experience you are looking for. I highly recommend., When Im in the mood to spend $30 on two drinks, Quill is my go-to. Never crowded, fantastic service, and truly delicious and creative cocktails. My favorite are the zodiac themed seasonal ones; I may have to head back again this month because the Leo was phenomenal., When I want an amazing cocktail in a quiet but really nice atmosphere, Quill is my go-to. Seek out Rachel behind the bar. She makes the most amazing fancy cocktails in town...maybe on the east coast. Live piano music in the evenings is a nice plus and adds to the overall amazing atmosphere of the Quill.If the bar area is full, go back by the restrooms and notice that there are two rooms that you can get table service in as well. They are like executive conference rooms, so I sometimes use this for customer meetings. Ends up being a really economical way to have a client meeting without having to rent a space. Went there last Sunday for their pre-fixe dinner menu. Its the same quality food from the connected restaurant (Plume) and is $35 for 3 courses + wine. Tomato salad was my first course. I hate tomatoes, but these were delicious. Main course was a soft shell crab sandwich that was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Final course was a mousse that exceeded expectations.Overall, a great experience and a good go-to bar., Oh my, what a GREAT place for drinks. Decided to stop in before heading off for 8:30pm reservations at Plume. Requested a fruity cocktail that wouldnt enhance my Asian glow. Lol. Bartender succeeded in delivering a delicious cocktail. Will be back soon!, I drink a lot. Potentially too much. So you might say I a bit of a professional when it comes to drinking. I know a lot of bars. I can tell the difference between a good manhattan and a bad one. Quill can, too.So, this is technically a hotel bar, and it a little far from places you would generally go out, and it disorientingly dim, but they do seriously know their way around a bar. There a fantastic rotating seasonal cocktail menu or theyl make you whatever else you could possibly want. Don drink so much that you can find your way out., Magical place for cocktails, you can sit at the bar to chat with the friendly bartenders (who clearly are at the top of their game!) and request a special off-the-menu drink. Or even preferably, with cocktail in hand, you can wander into the next room with the live piano. If youe lucky to see an empty seat by the piano, grab it--and enjoy live music up close with DC best and friendliest pianist, Peter, who sings and plays wonderful Gershwin and Cole Porter melodies., Amazing ambiance and delicious drinks. You feel like youve been transported back in time as soon as you walk in and are immediately greeted by the most friendly and inviting concierge and servers. This is the best spot for a romantic night!, Nice place to take older tourists for drinks. Yes, it is $15 a cocktail but youre paying for the great ambience. Cocktails were good some were great but they did not blow my mind. Servers apparently take turns bartending and they come up with all the drinks together and they are super nice and helpful. Try the two dollar fries!, Fantastic service accompanied by great food and cocktails in a very relaxed upscale environment. Quill offered us the perfect respite from the busy city. The hotel is amazing as well and so the bar needs to live up to the same standard and it does. We will definitely be back., A friend and I very much wanted to get dressed up one night in cocktail attire and go have drinks somewhere nice in DC. Neither of us had been to Quill, but we were extremely happy with our choice.Excellent. Amazing. Fantastic.Think of all the best adjectives you can think of and that would describe Quill. Its a dimly lit bar attached to the Jefferson Hotel. (And although I have never stayed as a guest in the hotel, you can tell its a very high class hotel). I walked thru the front entrance of the hotel to get into Quill and every single person who worked in the hotel that I passed greeted me with a smile and a welcome. Walking into Quill is almost like a cave - but in a good way. Low lighting, not a lot of noise. Its was a Monday night, so there were not a lot of other patrons, but that was fine.We sat at the corner on the bar for close to 3 hours and had a wonderful time. The drink menu has fancy cocktails with high prices. But, once you order and watch the skill and detail that go into each cocktail, you can understand. Each cocktail takes a few minutes to create, but once you take that first sip, you realize its one of the best cocktails youve ever had. Also, the extent of brands of each kind liquor was impressive. (My friend is a bourbon connoisseur, so when our bartender told him what varieties they offered, he was happy and impressed). This is the kind of place you go to with one other person and get lost in your own world and have fancy cocktails or good wine. I will absolutely be back., Awesome. Beautiful interior, outstanding cocktails, superb service, upscale yet friendly crowd. The molded glass bar is a work of art. The space is discreet, warm, inviting, yet updated, and the cocktails are spot-on perfection. Its expensive, but if you need to treat yourself to an nice drink in a chill atmosphere after a tough day this is the spot. Also an excellent date venue or a good place to take clients for a drink, as conversation is possible without the braying din to be suffered through at other venues like Edgar. Quill is the hotel bar for the Jefferson, but it is tucked away from the lobby area and has its own outside terrace and entrance onto 16th Street, so the mood is private, and one never feels like one is drinking in a hotel lobby., I visited Quill at the Jefferson on a Wednesday evening after work to get a drink with some friends. The location is convenient (just a couple blocks away from the Farragut metro stations) and the bar is quite nice - its dimly lit, classy, and has a cozy, intimate feel to it. I liked the cocktail selections and ended up ordering a Manhattan (quite strong). I also got some food - the croque monsieur sandwich. It was a delicious ham and cheese (gruyere) sandwich, but it was quite pricey - $18 - for a relatively small portion! Others in our group got food as well, including the cheese platter (rich in flavor, but small in portion) and the crab tartare (very delicious!).The reason Im giving this place 3 stars is that in addition to the 18% mandatory gratuity (since we had a party of 6 or more people), the hotel later charged us an additional 20%! We did not see this charge until we noticed our credit card statements a few days later. Apparently its a practice that several area hotels engage in, but I still think its very deceitful and tacky. It makes me think twice about visiting Quill, or any area hotel that charges an additional 20% after the fact, ever again.I was so going to leave 5 stars for my review after leaving the restaurant, but my experience was rather marred by the additional 20% charge (in addition to my already high bill and 18% gratuity)., Ie been to Quill a few times, and each time, Ie thoroughly enjoyed myself with both drinks and atmosphere here.The Jefferson itself is a very nice property, and so Quill is definitely an upmarket and stylish hotel restaurant without really feeling like a hotel restaurant. The atmosphere is very intimate, but in a way that can also be fun for a group of friends. There bar seating as well as comfy chairs for a more sitdown dinner aspect.I will say that the prices are pretty high there. Cocktails are around $14, with most of the food choices being less expensive than the drinks! But at the same time, you definitely get inventive and different drinks at Quill than you would at most bars. The bartenders have been very friendly each time I have gone.Overall, I would definitely recommend Quill for visitors and residents alike because it just a great place to have a drink. Especially with the weather getting warmer, their outdoor patio right on 16th Street will be a good place to chill with friends., Definitely a hidden gem at the Jefferson Hotel. Its a great place for a classy date night. Their specialty drink menu is diverse and ever changing, and the live piano music is phenomenal. Im partial to this place because it feels like youre travelling back in time to a classier era. I would recommend going even for one drink, just to enjoy the ambiance., Took out a hot North African woman who was visiting the nation capital for the first night. She was absolutely enthralled and impressed. She happily ordered more drinks and food then held my hand with much passion, Classy bar with classy people and music, but the atmosphere was not uptight. The night I was there, an old gentleman was playing piano the entire time. The bartender that we had was excellent--energetic, knowledgeable, and courteous. Wish I could remember his name to give him a shout-out, but I went here a month ago. The drinks are what you would expect at a classy bar, pricey. Definitely would come back; would be a great date spot, as you can walk to Dupont Circle nearby., The Quill is a great cocktail bar inside the Jefferson Hotel (Oh man, the Quill? I just got that joke!) just up the road from Obamas house. They serve up some great drinks, including an awesome bloody mary. Bartender Jason Swaringen submitted the Quills bloody recipe to a Thrillist contest and added a garnish of lump crabmeat to spruce it up, creating the tickled crab bloody mary. The usual fair doesnt come with the ice cube full of crab, but the people at Quill are happy to oblige if requested., My favorite bar, anywhere. The drinks are unbelievable and the folks who work here are kind, genuine, and make sure you have a great evening., Had the lobster club. Excellent. Some very good bourbon, too. Neat always. Perfect service. Wide range of dress and clientele. Relaxing setting. Saw some good looking cocktails going around. Everyone seemed to be enjoying them., We went here for evening cocktails and appetizers. The quiet, understated and classy atmosphere is head and shoulders above neighborhood offerings within a few blocks. The waitress swapped the bourbon for rye on one of their classic cocktails with a smile, even though rye wasnt on the menu. I cant say much for the vegetable sandwich: a bit mushy, perhaps owing to the hummus or something, and the fries were a-ok. Overall, this place has among the best service I have experienced of any lounge in recent times., Once I stepped inside I felt nobody would seat me. Many waiters came back and forth, nobody talked to me, nor greeted me. I waited for five minutes to see if there was ever anyone at least come to ask what I need. No one. I felt extremely ridiculous. May it be I dress in professionals or I am an Asian, so to stand between your bar and the entrance like an idiot, that everyone looked at me instead of your waiters? I will never come to this restaurant again., One of DCs best kept secrets. Cozy and private settings. Great drink list. Good food., Great place for a classy cocktail. Fairly quiet - we were there 7-9pm on a Saturday. Great range of cocktails, and interesting gins. Friendly staff on both sides of the bar., Its people like my server RACHEL who makes your world go round. Rachel was quick, persistent without being annoying, and punctual. These are such important characteristics of waitresses and waiters I forget what its like to be treated by one. The food is top notch, service supreme quality, place is dreamy and very romantic. Even dining soloIs a comfortable experience and mesmerizing. The piano player is amazing. I would visit this restaurant/ bar anytime ImIn DC! Oh and the food- greatness! I had the lobster sandwich, so great. I also had the apple cobbler- made in house. Delicious. Dont think twice about the quill. Go!
57|range-washington|From the perspective of how Range compares to the rest of Friendship Heights, this would be an easy five star review. There is simply no legitimate competition within the area; if you are looking for a high end restaurant in Friendship Heights, this is your only option and its a good one. The other relevant question is how does Range compare to other high end restaurants, and the answer, at least in my opinion, is that it is a solid choice for dinner that probably is best stated as a higher end version of Graffiato. What did we order? We started with the bread basket where the bacon marmalade accompanying the cornbread is sure to be a star. I also loved the gooseberry cream cheese paired with the ciabatta. The cheese plate was diverse and lovely with the cabot cheesecloth cheddar encompassing the field otherwise known as mind blowing. The goat cheese ravioli was incredible on its own but the savory accompanying sauce was a bit overpowering. Bone marrow was paired with sweet elements (heavy on raisins) and was a slight disappointment. The black cod, on the other hand, was delicate yet slightly crisp and one of the finer accomplishments that we tried. The hanger steak was another winner; this flavorful cut of meat was a perfect medium rare. The leg of lamb was fine but probably a bit overpriced for what we received. Still, overall, I was quite impressed not only with the range of cooking (the restaurant has nine separate kitchens) but also the execution. Its not surprising that this is from the team that brought us Volt. The drinks were pretty good. I ended up getting some emasculating whiskey drink colored a bright pink. I didnt care; the balanced elements within the drink were nothing short of exceptional. I would not be surprised if the bar becomes a five star experience in and of itself. Im certainly going to try and talk my office into drinking here regularly. Service was nice and friendly although slightly pushy towards getting us extra food when we were clearly stuffed. Then again, it worked. And truly, the goat cheese cheesecake was quite divine (we werent really fans of the accompanying lemon sorbet, but its very tart for those who love tartness). This is a great addition to Friendship Heights and a solid addition to DCs high end dining scene. Its worth the trip to the further reaches of Northwest DC., Range was wonderful on its opening pop up event. The staff was working hard to keep customers happy, and it wss clearly succeeding. The atmosphere was open, bright, and refreshingly clean. As a long time friendship heights restaurant, the renovation of the entire pavilion was very welcoming, and the restaurant is a rustic but modern addition. Now to the food!We ordered the cheese platter as a starter so that we could decide on favorites for future trips. This was a good choice and great value. We ordered the bone marrow which was a slight disappointment (especially if youe had it at Blue Duck Tavern). There wasn enough marrow or bread, and there was too many sweet fillers inside the bone. The beef cheek tagliatelle was great. It was tender in a light cream sauce. The surprise of the night was the Cauliflower zahtar side dish. It was cooked and spiced perfectly. For our proteins, we had the full rabbit and the leg of lamb. I would rank the rabbit, which is served in patties of mixed meat, as of higher caliber. The lamb was okay - well cooked but could use more spices. Upon finishing our meal, we spotted another table getting the whole lamb rotisserie. It serves 6-10, but looked phenomenal. I would love to try that. For dessert we had an after dinner drink called with coffee which we decided was too heavy- handed on the rum. Salted caramel icecream and truffles off of the dessert cart were a perfect ending to a well rounded meal. Our favorite drink was the Australian Cabernet, but we recommend trying 2-3 of the cocktails. The bartender is great. Staff: Our waiter, Sam from Nashville, was knowledgable, respectful courteous and friendly. Other restaurants should take note of Range local touch. We met Brian Voltaggio at the end of our dinner, and as long time fans and volt diners, we look forward to his new culinary adventure.Ultimately, go sooner rather than later, try new things, and hope this place stays as down to earth as it is now., After studying Range awesome menu, and realizing I wanted to try a far greater variety of dishes than would be possible during a normal dinner, I had a plan--I order way too much food, practice restraint, and treat the meal as best as I could as a tasting menu, waving away half-eaten dishes and creating tons of leftovers.Our server explained that though the restaurant would be able to deal with 300 customers at full capacity, the first of the preview nights would only serve 130 as the crew got up to speed. We had no problem with being guinea pigs, and because of this found whatever slips in the level of service that occurred to be endearing rather than troublesome.And since the food was amazing, everything I hoped it would be, causing quite a few moans that it perhaps best one only utters when among friends, I had no problem with being part of helping the crew figure out how to operate in this new environment. In fact, I enjoyed watching the learning process.We started off with the tasting of hams, dry cured meats, and terrines, which included a rich, creamy potted foie gras worth any lecture about cholesterol from my doctor.We followed that up with goat cheese ravioli over braised meat ragu plus lobster mac and cheese, the latter of which was one of the stars of the evening--large chunks of lobster with al dente pasta in an extra-sharp cheddar sauce. We all agreed that if unshared, it would make a wonderful lunch all by itself.Then it was time ... for meat! One of the dishes I most been looking forward to was whole rabbit, hunter style. Both because, well, I wasn entirely sure what hunter style meant, but also since I had no idea whether such a dish would remain on the menu as time went on if there wasn enough demand. So it was one of the musts for the night.As it turns out, rather than having an entire rabbit brought to the table where I imagined we be ripping chunks of meat off a carcass, it was served deboned, mixed with fines herbs and the fat from the back haunches and served in thick slices. To my untrained palate, it seemed like a cross between a sausage and head cheese, but whatever the true term for it, it was rich, flavorful, and comfortingly dense.Next up, veal heart, chimichurri, which I felt I had to order, both because I never eaten it before (which always comes into play when I ordering), but also out of my fear that the demand might not be great enough for it to remain on the menu. It proved less popular with my companions than it did with me, but that might be more because of the idea of eating a heart rather than the actuality of it. As for me, it was a primal experience, so I was lost for a few moments, off on my own, communing with the beast that yielded it up, gorging on the stuff of life.Another of the stars of the night was actually a dish we hadn expected to arrive at our table--leg of lamb, root vegetable puree, sea beans. In one of those slips I referenced above, we actually ordered a different lamb dish, but the mix-up proved quite serendipitous, as it left us raving.On the lighter side, we ordered black cod, bbq hazelnuts, sorghum, perfectly cooked, which reminded me of how poor a chef I am. I once read somewhere that the difference between a perfectly cooked piece of fish and one that either over- or under-cooked can be measured in seconds. And I not enough of a wizard to make that decision as to when to pull a piece of fish from the fire. The chefs at Range obviously were, because it couldn have been better cooked.Just because Ie left the vegetable dishes to the end, don think they were any less delectable. We tried many different veggie sides. The hands-down winner was the bowl of fried (yes, fried!) brussels sprouts--and they were fried in bacon! Truly groan-worthy. Not meant for an actual vegetarian, obviously, but awesome nonetheless. I can see going to Range and not ordering up a bowl. Though not as surprising as the fried Brussels spouts, the rotisserie potatoes with bacon and caramelized onion were equally as delicious.Then there was a dish I should have slotted in earlier in the night, but couldn let the meal end without sampling--skillet corn bread with bacon marmalade. When a slice of slathered corn bread hit my tongue, my wife had to tell me to stop moaning. It was one of those foodie moments when, if you been around listening in with your eyes closed, our table would have been indistinguishable from an orgy.And then we come to the desserts, which included an generous serving of rice pudding surrounded by bowls of caramelized quince, brazil nuts, chocolate, and spiced marshmallow. And Irene ordered the warm apple crisp with brown butter pecan ice cream. And then a dessert cart was rolled over to our table filled with brownies, barks, biscotti and more.At which point, four hours after we began our meal, we were forced to admit defeat. We hit the food wall, and were ready to head home, happy., Vastly different in look and feel from Volt in Frederick, Bryans new restaurant RANGE delivers the same level of amazement and commitment to an awesome dining experience.Come early, as the bar is phenomenal, a candycopia of really nice cocktails, if you have anything less than three, youll be missing out.The food, much as at Volt, is amazing and consistently good throughout the menu with some really surprising treatments. A quick couple of amazing favorites, the kale Caesar salad, the yellowfin tuna, the lobster with chilis - and an amazing cornbread with bacon marmalade. Likely its all that good, we stopped at twelve platesThe staff is still learning, but it they retain their friendly professionalism, the restaurant will enjoy a reputation for first class service., Thanks to some crazy jetlag from my recent trip to Beijing, I was awake at 5am on Black Friday when reservations opened for pop-up preview weekend for Range.Range is set in the Chevy Chase Pavilion on the upper level near the Cheesecake Factory in the space where Steinmart once was. The space is gorgeous and ginormous- 9 kitchens, wine case displays, many seating areas including some private rooms, bar seats along the actual bar and then seats where you can watch the going-ons of the kitchen. We were seated at a table near the front - I was facing the bar which was fine by me... I very much enjoyed watching the bartenders flex their muscles shaking up some cocktails all night.Speaking of- I had the urban conformist cocktail ($11) which was vodka, tea, lemon and oak- served in a tall glass with a fantastic metal spoon-straw. In addition to their cocktails- they have punches and housemade sodas.The menu set up reminds me of Graffiato- it pretty much sharable smaller plates so it best to go with a group of friends (and ones who aren terribly picky) or have lots of food allergies.We had the bakers basket with spreads ($10), the tasting of all cheeses ($10) and the kale caesar ($9) to start. Each cheese is $5 so if youe going to order more than one, just get the tasting because youe already at $10. The bacon marmalade with the skillet cornbread and chive butter is simply amazing. I have high hopes that they will be selling this marmalade at the market store here. I was also a fan of the ciabatta paired with a smoked cream cheese and gooseberry jam. So. good. The seamless Cherry Glen Farms goat cheese ravioli ($9) was really delicious and sat on top of a braised meat ragu. The beef marrow bones ($12) were probably the least successful dish for me- the raisins and onions were very sweet and completely overpowered any other flavors in the dish. However, the roasted black cod with bbq hazelnuts and sorghum ($14) was easily my favorite dish of the night. It was hard to share with 3 other people because I wanted it all to myself. Easy to share were the veal sweetbreads with winter truffle ($24). They come 4 to an order and are over a celeriac puree. Worth it.For our meats, we had the roseda beef hanging tender ($21) and the leg of lamb with root vegetable puree and sea beans ($29). Both cuts were grilled to a perfect medium rare and were so tender and flavorful. Our sides consisted of the rotisserie potatoes with bacon and caramelized onion ($5), roasted sunchokes ($9) and creamed swiss chard ($6). The chard needed a touch of salt but was otherwise enjoyable. After having seen the cookie/candy cart go by several times, we decided there was just a small amount of space left in our stomachs for some dessert. While I didn order anything from the cart, I did order the Cherry Glen Farm Goat Cheese Cheesecake ($8). The lemon sorbet on the plate was not my favorite (very tart) but the cake and other flavors were wonderful. Service was very friendly and always close by to clear a plate, bring fresh silverware or refill our water glasses. Oh I also need to mention- during your meat course, they will bring you a shun steak knife. Shun! Color me impressed...I couldn stop gushing over it. Love love love having a Voltaggio restaurant within the city-limits so we don have to trek to Frederick for his food offerings. I can wait til they start lunch service because obtaining a dinner reservation from here on out may be impossible., 2.5 starsAfter the early reviews of range I was super excited to try it last night. I had a feeling service and things here and there might be spotty as they iron out all the kinks. As it turned out the service was quite good and it was the food that had issues. The food here is meant to be shared, like tapas. Some dishes are bigger than others, so be sure to check. Or just be ready to eat lots of food.The Good:-Cornbread - bacon marmalade was awesome. Bread was warm and not overly crumbley. -roasted carrots and turnips side - delicious heirloom carrots.-Kale Cesar-Kimchi Linguini - Best dish of the night. Not a big dish, but fantastic.-Lamb chops - Absolutely awesome, cooked perfect mid-rare. You get two double cut chops, enough for an entree or to share a chop each for 4.The O.K.:The sweetbreads - a little too much breading, but they were cooked properly and not over salted.The Bad (and salty):-Fried potatoes - just over salted french fries. Without the over seasoning, they would have been great-Chicken - overly salty-Brussels Sprouts - salty-Cauliflower - oily and tasteless-sunchokes - oily, but not terribleOverall interior:The place is HUGE. Seats 300. There are lots of moving parts. The interior and overall restaurant is really simple and classy.I hope that this meal is not representative of range... Ill give it another shot in a few months. But from this visit, my entire table was disappointed., Thanks to my friend who regularly wakes up freakishly early we were able to score a table at Range for the soft opening weekend. We are big fans of Volt and so we were super excited to try out Bryan Voltaggio new and closer restaurant. We got to the restaurant on time but the restaurant hostess seemed flustered and told us we should wait at the bar until our table was ready. While we waited 40 minutes we ordered a couple drinks. The unfinished mishap (cachaca, mango, lime, and kummel) was interesting and a little sweet but I found the Mexican warhead (mezcal, roasted apple, strawberry vinegar, and apricot) overly smoky and couldn finish it (I think I just not a mezcal kind of girl). Luckily my friend is a lush and finished it for me. Disappointed with my previous drink I decided to go with the safe route and get a vodka cocktail and so I ordered an urban conformist (vodka, tea, lemon, oak) which I loved. Not very strong - like a light tea with a little kick. It comes with a ton of crushed ice and a little metal spoon/straw. We checked in with the hostess and think she forgot about us. Finally we were seated and the eating could begin! We decided to just order a ton of food so we could try out a lot of dishes but since we had been stuffing our faces all weekend with sushi and meat, we didn order from the raw bar or wood grill. We also passed on the pizza since those looked pretty big and would take up prime stomach real estate. We got the skillet corn bread with bacon marmalade and the cheddar chive biscuits with pepper jelly. Both were amazing! I want to carry a jar of bacon marmalade with me everywhere I go and smear it on all my food forever and ever. Definitely make sure you try the breads by themselves though because they are both delicious and the spreads, while super yummy, overpower all other flavors. They brought out the cheese plate right after we stated eating the bread which required a juggling of plates and our waitress plopped down the plate and left before we could ask which cheeses were which. I definitely recommend getting the tasting of all the cheeses because it not that much and you get a nice sampling. From what we could tell we had a sharp cheddar/parmesan, a brie, a blue cheese, a semi soft cheese, and I think some sort of sheep milk cheese. This was served with some fruity, nutty bread and this amazing jelly fruit crunchy thing (I have no idea what it was). At the same time they also brought us the potted foie gras which we were super excited about since we both love foie gras and so a pot of it sounded wonderfully decadent. Sadly this was our least favorite thing of the night. The foie gras had all the wonderful fattyness but none of the rich flavor. Another service mishap was that we were told when we ordered that the black cod (with bbq hazelnuts and sorghum) would be served to us after our pasta dishes and with our side dishes but there muste been a mistake because we were served the cod with all of our pasta dishes which didn quite go together. The black cod was delicious and I loved the nuts! They were surprisingly soft, not crunchy. We ordered three of the pastas because they were what intrigued us the most. We had the goat cheese ravioli over braised meat ragu which was amazing, the kimchi linguine with uni and scallops which didn taste much like kimchi to me (but I Korean so I used to super spicy and pungent kimchi) but was also amazing, and the lobster mac and cheese which if you pair each bite with a piece of lobster was great but the pasta on its own was just ok. Lastly, we were served the brussel sprouts and everything mashed potatoes. These were both surprisingly fantastic and some of our favorite dishes of the night. The mashed potatoes really do taste like they have everything loaded in there and the brussel sprouts were fried in bacon (nuf said). After each course you are encouraged to have your leftovers wrapped up and taken home which is great since there are so many things to try and only so little stomach space.By this point my friend and I were groaning from being so stuffed and we couldn even imagine trying to cram down a rich desert. Also none of the desserts really caught our eye. So instead we got some of the truffles to go and ate them the next day. We got the almond, pistachio, espresso, sesame, and caramel (listed in order of my preference) and they were all wonderful.We rolled our way out, stuffed to the gills. All in all the food was satisfying and delicious but the service is definitely a bit rough around the edges. Everyone is super nice and friendly but there were communication and plating issues along with other awkwardness that ended up affecting our dining experience. But I sure all this will get ironed out soon. I still prefer the food at Volt but it great having another fantastic Voltaggio restaurant so much closer and with so many options!, Range, Ie been waiting for you for awhile. I a huge Voltaggio fan so when I discovered that Bryan restaurant in DC would be opening the week of my birthday, I quickly sniped a reservation for their opening night (first day after the soft opening). Me and two other friends dined here, and while the experience was okay, the food was disappointingly mediocre.- Skillet corn bread with bacon marmalade - just okay but not worth all the hype. Many other yelpers raved about how good this was but meh. The corn bread was super crumbly when it could be moister, and it coulde used some chunks of whole corn or jalapeno or something. The marmalade tasted like I was eating a beef jerky sauce, which is neither good nor bad but not too special.- Kimchi linguini, uni, bay scallops, nasturtium - the flavors were just okay and I could barely taste the kimchi, but it was still the best course of the night (but only relative to the other mediocre dishes)- Pork cheeks, celeriac, moustarda - I don have much to say about this dish, it was wholly uninteresting- Brussels sprouts, chestnuts, and pancetta - it was way too salty and coulde used something smoother to offset the saltiness. This reminded me of a less inspired version of the Brussels sprouts from Graffiato (which are amazing).- Whole rabbit, hunter style - our table collectively agreed that this was the worst dish of the night. When the menu says whole rabbit, I expected a whole rabbit or something, but what we got instead was a fat rabbit-sized sausage that tasted super gamey as if the rabbit innards were blended with rabbit meat. We ordered our first round of food conservatively, initially deciding that we would go for a second round if it was amazing. But although none of us were full after sharing the courses, we decided to skip more food/dessert because we were pretty turned off by the rabbit dish especially. We ended up having homemade ice cream at my house for dessert.I sure that once Range has been open for awhile, theyl test more recipes and have a stronger menu. Service-wise, the restaurant was reminiscent of a new place with some kinks to iron out, as everything was okay but a little awkward. I had written on my reservation that the dinner was for my birthday, but I didn hear so much as a happy birthday from anyone on the staff. When we were ordering, our waiter kept questioning us and telling us that we needed more food even though we were pretty certain of what we wanted. When they carted the sweets cart around to sell us desserts, I was bored because there wasn anything that was unique enough that I couldn make at home myself. At least they managed to keep my water glass full, so they get props for that. Overall, I was disappointed with my experience, as they certainly have room for improvement., Please disregard the star rating as I have not yet eaten here. The review is more a comment on the reservation system.Range...I want to like you but youre making it really hard. 2nd day of business 8pm tried to get a spot at the bar...nothing....OK. 4th day of business 6pm same story at the bar and hostess says all tables are reserved all night, really? I stood outside for 20 minutes and watched numerous tables remain empty and 95% of the seats at the raw bar stay empty. What gives? Are you trying to create a buzz that youre booked months in advance or worried the new staff will be overwhelmed if you have a full house? They say that they are 60% reservations and 40% walk in...AYOR, My friend and I grabbed two seats at the bar at about 5:45PM on Friday. I glad we came as early as we did because by the time 7PM rolled around, the bar area was teeming with patrons hovering to snag newly vacated seats. The Range is an expansive, gleaming food emporium encased in shiny glass and laden with granite and stainless steel. Almost all of the open kitchen is lined by a bar which allows patrons a clear view of food preparation. Voltaggio was noted amongst the team of chefs and service staff, along with cornbread baking in iron skillets and the shucking of fresh shellfish pulled from display. I ordered my first drink by informing the bartender of my preferences: bitter, sour, herbaceous, spicy. He hit the nail on the head with the makeshift harmony ($11) - rum, .75 oz of angostura bitters, St. Germain, and lemon. This drink demonstrated to me that this would be my new favorite drink spot in DC/MD/VA. No one else in this area has a bar program that is as comprehensive as this, at this price point. The Gibson comes to mind, sure, as does PX (haven visited the Columbia Room yet) but the staff at these places can be pretentious. The Range came across to me as friendly and down-to-earth, devoid of any elitism. Our bartender was especially accommodating, attentive, and personable. Most importantly, he served a great drink. My bitter-heavy drink was followed by a east sea ($11), comprised of gin, St. Germain, Kombu broth, and hellfire bitters. Next time I come back Il ask them to make the makeshift harmony with hellfire bitters. From the food menu we opted for the assortment of charcuterie ($48), which was huge. Refer to photo in the album for reference. The quantity and quality was amazing. There were four shaved hams, four pates, and a separate plate featuring potted foie gras. I would definitely recommend this for a table of at least 4 people. It very rich. This was instead split between two dudes. I felt my cholesterol levels rising as I enjoyed unadulterated carnivorous hedonism. Pulling the trigger on this order meant that we really couldn eat anything else.But for good measure I decided to load up on a half-dozen oysters ($18) and a half-dozen Taylor Bay scallops ($18), all fresh and delicious. Next time I might go all in and do a seafood blowout for $120 (listed as all in on the menu). Given the abundance from the charcuterie assortment, I have good hopes of the same satisfaction from this all in order. The Range also has a separate confectionary section. I inquired of my bartender the chocolates, so he called for the chocolate cart to be rolled by. The pieces that stood out were the cashew bark and the cassis truffle. All were delicious. I decided at the conclusion of my meal to purchase a box of their offerings as this would serve as my contribution to my family white elephant Christmas gifting.All in all, The Range offered a great experience. It big, shiny, and given what we ordered, has great quality food at a key price point. It is a golden addition to Friendship Heights, an area full of upscale chain restaurants serving bad to mediocre food. Il have to return for more drinks and to try other things on their menu., I very much enjoyed range. Its upscale yet not stuffy. I thought the food was great and the service was excellent., Here what we ordered:-2 cocktails each-cheddar chive biscuits-potted foie gras-little gem lettuce with bacon and blue cheese-ravioli with goat cheese and ragu-pork cheeks-roseda beef hanging tender-brussels sprouts-french friesThis came to be an expensive meal, but they told us to each order 3-4 dishes. This is good to note because the menu itself, if you look it up online, doesn indicate that it small plates, but it modeled on that concept so your meal will be more expensive than you think, if you were planning to just order one salad and one meat dish.The food was generally quite good, especially the pasta and meat dishes. The space is pretty.However, there were a lot of negatives, which hopefully will get worked out:-Food came out as it was served. Our server said this was a food journey and told us as much up front. However, after the pork cheeks came out, they literally cleared our plates, re-set the table, and then it still took 20 minutes for the beef, brussels sprouts, and fries. By that point we were kind of tired and full and honestly didn even want the last 3 dishes. The whole meal took over 2 hours, which is a long time when youe not out for a particularly special occasion but rather just to try it out.-Service was SLOW. We waited for drinks at the bar (which was packed, so we had to hover at 7pm on a Friday). We waited for refills of drinks at the bar. We were never offered water at the bar. We waited for menus. We waited for biscuits, which came out AFTER the salad/foie gras. We waited for beef (see above). We waited. And waited.-It was expensive all in. Cocktails were fine but not as good as Jackie or the Gibson.-Menu is trendy and minimalist, which means you don really know what youe getting. For example, the brussels sprouts were drenched in fish sauce, which was good, but may not be for everyone. The cheddar biscuits were actually pretty spicy, but again, that wasn described. Etc.-Wine by the glass was VERY expensive - $11-16 plus- despite the fact that the bottle prices were really good (many in the $28-40 dollar range). This place needs more reasonable glasses of wine.I sure other kinks will work themselves out - twice, we were asked by hostesses what our name was and if we had a reservation, after we already checked in. First, at the bar, and then again when we were at our table almost done eating. Go figure. As another example, our first dish was accidentally served to the table next to ours, and then when they refused it, we were brought it. We were accidentally served two orders of biscuits, as well, and turned down the second order noting we already eaten a full order., What a disappointment. The eagerness of the staff cannot compensate for the awful food. The cornbread was huge, but totally tasteless and dry. The fennel salad was tough, over-dressed, and in sore need of other greens to lighten it up. The black sea bass did not taste fresh, was practically raw in the middle, and did not partner well with the chickpea puree. I get the sense that this restaurant is still trying to find its culinary identity, and struggling to be too many things to too many people. Its celebrity chef needs some measure of focus, and narrow his culinary ambitions. He can start by paring down the bewildering menu. And maybe also educating his receptionist that tapas originated from the Iberian peninsula, and not Mexico!, Ok, its hard to go to a restaurant called Range as a vegetarian. But having been to Volt, I knew there would be some good options. My wife and I were lucky enough to get reservations for the preview, and our meal was thoroughly enjoyable. Not having seen the menu until dinner made for a surprise. There were a few vegetarian options, but not nearly as veg-friendly as Volt. Most of the options were sides and Pizza. Fortunately all were fantastic. Our particular favorite was the Jalapeno Cheddar Biscuits with spicy jelly...fantastic!! Also, being lucky enough to be at the preview, we met with Bryan Voltaggio who offered to prepare some special vegetarian courses for us. One of the was a mushroom rice dish that was amazing. Another, a Kimchi noodle dish with fried Kale, brussel sprouts and a mouth watering sauce. Overall, it was an excellent dinner and atmosphere, and relatively cheap (at least for the vegetarian food). Hopefully more veggie dishes get added to the menu. We will be sure to return when in the area!, When it comes to dining at a celebrity chefs restaurant, we usually keep our expectations low, so as not to get disappointed. This was one of those rare experiences that was just that--an amazing experience. We didnt get preview tickets, so had to find the right time to score some bar seats one evening when they opened. This didnt disappoint. Dane the Bartender took great care of us--pleasant, professional, and explained the mixology program like the pro that he is. The cocktails were serious, made with the freshest of ingredients.  The dishes were interesting and each had so many levels of flavors. Since our visit, I have been daydreaming of the bacon marmalade with corn bread. Solid cheese plate with bigger portions than you would have expected. The pizza with fresh cheese, rosemary, meatloaf and potatoes was (considering its hearty ingredients) surprisingly light and the crust was definitely special. The sunchokes refreshing and light. The lobster mac n cheese was delicious and served with a giant claw of meat. Anyone who complains about the price does not understand what a real dining experience is. You must expect to drop a little cash when you are in the presence of true professionals., As a Friendship Heights resident and huge Top Chef fan, I am so excited to have Range in the neighborhood! My friends and I had an 8:30 reservation on a Friday night and had to wait about 15 to actually sit down, but the bar has very attentive bartenders and great cocktails (try the east sea). We were led to our table and told that our waiter would be with us shortly. Well, 5 minutes pass. I asked a nearby server where our waiter was, and she said she would find him and in the meantime brought us water. Still no menus at this point. Another 5 minutes or so pass and then our waiter finally appears. Throughout the meal our waiter would disappear and it was very awkward when we wanted to order more courses/ wine/the check because we were flagging down random servers to get someones attention. To his credit, he was very knowledgeable about the menu and was very friendly, but he could have been more accessible. Range has only been open for 2 weeks, so perhaps the kinks have not been worked out yet. But besides the uneven service, the food was actually really delicious. Between four of us we ordered the skillet corn bread, cheddar chive biscuits, yellow fin tuna, kimchi linguine, ravioli, salumeria pizza, lamb shanks, roseda beef hanging tender (aka hanger steak), venison, Brussels sprouts, and everything mashed potatoes. Honestly, everything was near perfection except the lamb shanks (sauce was too sweet), venison (came out cold), and the mashed potatoes (really soupy, come on!). The skillet corn bread and bacon marmalade lived up to the hype, but my group was raving about the cheddar chive biscuits in the end. Range also has a great wine list and we spent less than $30 on a pretty good Pinot Grigio. Overall, the menu has so much variety that you could end up spending a little or a lot of money here depending on what you order. Our total bill was $240 including tax and tip (and 2 bottles of wine). One minor complaint: its annoying to have a group of 4 and be served dishes that have 3 items. For example, the ravioli plate only has 3 ravioli pieces and 1 order of biscuits has 3 biscuits. I wish restaurants would just adjust the sizing; its difficult to split a ravioli and a biscuit into quarters!!, Bottom line, I think there is great potential here, and I going to be back, at least for drinks and snacks at the bar. The cocktail I had was excellent (Antique Dose), and the food was generally really good, and when it wasn great, it at least didn work in interesting ways (I looking at you, fried sweetbreads). I rather a chef went for it. And in this format, with small plates, you can forgive. The chestnut ravioli, beets, cornbread with bacon marmalade, and hushpuppies helped that forgiveness along.But Range confuses me: I believe that they are going for fancy bistro with a relaxed twist. But the room is a little too banquet hall hotel (big and blandly swanky) mixed with diner (crowded but not cozy). My biggest problem is that it is upmarket enough in feel that I expected the service to be crisp, if slightly unbuttoned. A few humble suggestions: have two hosts at the host station - especially because the host station is outside the restaurant, a little (ok, a lot) more effort is needed to welcome (greet me as I walk up , otherwise I don know if I just head inside, or hesitate awkwardly at the door) and send off guests(if you offer to take my coat, don make me wait 5 minutes for your host to finish a reservation before giving it back to me); train the servers and bussers - the waiter and barstaff was mostly very good (except end of meal, Il get there), but someone needs to work on the others (no, do it again but without giggling no, do it again but without spilling crisply!); lastly, fix the end of meal experience - the candy cart is cool and fun, but I still expect the waiter to manage the whole meal and we felt abandoned at the end.Drinks and snacks ill they figure out the rest., I decided to create a Yelp account after my unpleasant experience at Range last night. Let me start with the positive. The hanger steak ($18) and the brussel sprouts ($5) were tasty. In fact, the brussel sprouts were amazing - the perfect amount of garlic and seasoning, washed out with a balsamic tanginess. They were the best Ie ever had. The skillet corn bread ($3) was also amazing.The rest of the dishes were average. The bone marrow dish ($12) consisted of two pieces. One of the bones was just that - a bone - with no marrow. The other was full of roasted marrow and was enjoyable, not worth $12 though. The cheese plate ($10) was just OK, as a friend put it. The slices were tiny, which would have been fine if they had included better quality cheeses. The soft cheeses were the worst of the bunch. We also ordered the oyster/shitake mushroom dish ($10) and the rotisserie potatoes with bacon and caramelized onion ($5), but neither showed up.It is worth noting that Range just recently opened. They are clearly still working out the kinks as the manager ended up explaining to us after our meal. In fact, they continued to work out the kinks for over an hour while we waited for our check... for over an hour... FOR OVER AN HOUR. In case you missed it, we waited for well over an hour for the check to come. Here is what happened. We had a table of 16 for a birthday party, having booked 7:30 reservations well in advance. At the beginning of the meal, our server offered to split the check, assuring us that it would not be a problem. 20 minutes after requesting the checks, we realized that it was, in fact, a problem and requested that they just provide us one itemized check. For the next 30 to 40 minutes they attempted to calm us with the following lines: (1) it will just be another minute, (2) we are still working out the kinks, and (3) sorry about that - we appreciate your patience. In the end, they alerted us to the fact that they were not able to separate the check after all, and presented us with what we had asked for 30 minutes prior - one itemized bill. The server and manager then promptly disappeared, leaving us to work out the approximately $1,000 check (which, at that point, was fine with us).There were other issues too: (1) many of the dishes we never received were still on the check, (2) a server accidentally spilled on the birthday boy and his wife purse, and (3) most of the main dishes came out before the side dishes. However, we all agreed that the customer service (on the part of management) was atrocious. Definitely, the worst restaurant experience I have ever had.Considering everything above, I giving Range one star. If the service had been better, I would have given the restaurant a higher rating., Though a little nervous of hitting the new restaurant as many reviews cited kinks to be worked out, our table of 6 was overall very impressed with service and quality of food this past Saturday night.Our first impression of the restaurant was the not best- there were two hostesses, the one we spoke with the check in was pretty rude - after providing our party information, she just looked at her book and didnt say a thing, so we hovered for awhile, waiting for someone to escort us to our table. After 5 minutes, I went up and asked what the status was, should we go to the bar and not linger around the hostess stand and she curtly said that our table was ready, but there were just several parties in front of us they were seating- thanks buddy, you cant be that grizzled already, the restaurant opened less than 2 weeks ago!Ok, on to the rest of the great experience, we ordered several cocktails- all good (i really loved the los rudos and beyond the pale. Wine list was well edited and well-priced as other yelpers have mentioned.Food wise, what didnt we order? Bread basket, kale salad, little gem salad, a dozen oysters, lamb shank, black cod, skate, pork loin, mashed taters, brussels and sunchokes. All items were delicious- standouts include the bread basket which was plentiful (we had more than half to take home with us- the biscuits are not to be missed!) loved the kale caesar, black cod was great and loved the hazelnuts with it- surprising, and their brussels are heavenly. And while I dont love lamb, I could recognize that the shank was pretty delicious. Dessert wise we ordered two things, one i cannot remember as the espresso ice cream which was the standout!Atmosphere wise we were seated by the candy counter in the back so was bright, especially for dinner, but we got used to it. It is loud but thats par for course. And the 28-35 age group in our party really liked the musicSide note: Bryan V was working around the restaurant- definitely nice to see that he is very present with his new project; my husband had the luck of running into him on his way back from the restroom and apparently he could not have been more gracious.Really looking forward to my next visit!, The caveat to my review is that I have only been here once and I really wish I could give 3.5 stars but it just wasnt 4 star material for the expectations. The atmosphere was noisy, shiny, and young for the area (30- 60 year olds (60 is the new 55)). The staff were generally very young but well versed in the menu for the most part. They were attentive, willing to provide recommendations, and there were at least 5 or 6 servers who did that hovering thing that they do at fancy places. The drinks were inventive, tasty, and too small. I felt more sober after each drink but they were good! They will custom mix you a drink so take advantage of that. Finally, the food. Good all around but not as good as I was expecting for the place I was dining. The menu seems like it should be split in two. Cornbread, biscuits, salad, steak, pizza, root veg, etc on one menu with the raw oyster, shellfish, and fish dishes split into a seafood menu. It just seemed like the menu was looking for an identity and cornbread with raw oysters, skate, and mackerel just didnt work. My bad on that one. I would definitely give this place another try. I think it will get better and better and the prices really arent that bad for the amount of food you get., Went to Range on a wednesday night with two friends. We found a few seats at the elegant bar and were immediately greeted by the friendly bar staff. The cocktail list was amazing. Every drink we had was fantastic and imaginative! The kitchen is divided into nine station and we had a little something from each one and were more than pleased with everything we had. In the mood for sweets? A delightful pastry cart is constantly circulating throughout the large and elegant dining room.My favorite dish was the beef heart, and my favorite cocktail the Mexican Warhead! Thank you so much for a wonderful experience, I will surely be back for more!, Went to Range late Saturday night for a quickie--a little drink at the bar and some food. My first test is always: Are there hooks under the bar for your bag? Yes! Though they were hard to find as they were situated closer to the seats vs nestled under the bar. Ordered a house made soda (just not in the mood for drinking though the huge perfectly surfaced ice cubes in one drink was appealing and I like to try the beverage with the meat-stock cube) -- refreshing, aok. Kale caesar started out great--pretty, good croutons, nice plating. By the end, it tasted gloppy and I almost didn finish it. Chestnut ravioli with squash and serrano--gloppy, gloppy, gloppy. Food just does not have that green, springy, healthy feel. Overall, both dishes left me with gloppiness and not a great mouth-feel. Maybe a complete meal would be great, and I like to see what the stand-outs are given the wide range of the menu. Bartender was A+, nice demeanor, serious about his craft. I can imagine they can do all the things on the menu well--why not pare down? Dining room felt cold with no romance or nooks. Open, almost sterile white-space, almost a dated feeling. No desire to return. I am de-ranged. And a few typos on the menu! Instead: Ripple on Connecticut Avenue on the other hand had an amazing agnollotti and wonderful Brussels sprouts with spiced yogurt--fresh, good, clean food, wonderful dessert wines and drinks, amazing people who work there, and a wide range of very good cheese and charcuterie., Oh boy, where to begin? We celebrated the holidays a little earlier this year by (miraculously perhaps) snagging a reservation at Range, which turned out to be an all-around fun experience. Of all the adjectives I could have used, I think fun most aptly describes my dinner there for a number of reasons. Firstly, dishes are small, so between the two of us, we tried 8 different things plus cocktails. (this ended up being way too much, but holy crap it was good) There are a number of categories to choose from (pizzas, pastas, entree meat courses, vegetarian, baked goods, etc), and since everything kind of tapas-sized (slightly larger I say), you be better served bringing a dining companion who more inclined to share.Secondly, there are loads of different places to sit! We got a spot by the raw bar, but there are boothy seats, bar seats, and regular tables as well. I didn get a chance to scope out the place, but there lots of seating available.Third... I a huge fan of people watching anywhere I at, and Range kitchen-side dining slots were as good as any for eavesdropping on ridiculous conversations. (warning to those with the ridiculous convos going: keep it down in case people like me are nearby)Annnndddd you can see Bryan Voltaggio wander around the different kitchens helping put dishes together. (He so serious-looking) This last point is just kind of a random plus. On to the food. We ordered the chive biscuits with pepper jelly, ciabatta with smoked cream cheese, cheese sampler with seed-laden multi-grain bread, yellowtail sashimi, butternut squash ravioli, rib-eye cap, wild mushrooms, everything mashed potatoes, and a couple cocktails. I would highly recommend the yellowtail and steak (if theye still around; I don know how frequently the menus change). The yellowtail was as good as any youl get at decent west coast sushi joints, and the dollops of sauce (an avocado remoulade?) were great with the bits of pickled ginger and citrus seasoning. The rib-eye cap was amazing; no lie. The buttery tender beef (get it medium rare) was full of delicious beefy flavor and kind of just melted in my mouth. Get it get it get it holy crap. Also, the pizza we ordered was AWESOME. I loved the wood-fired pizzas at Il Canale, but Range has Il Canale beat. The crust was chewy, soft, and delicious, and the toppings were premium bits of amazingness (burata, salumeria, and sun dried tomatoes). Amazing. The mushrooms were rather plain and not worth trying, the ciabatta was awesome (especially with the pepper jelly), and the everything mashed potatoes were indescribably creamy and well-seasoned. They had everything from butter, poppy seeds, and cream in addition to who knows what else. The mashed potatoes are a great dish to share due to its richness, so I wouldn recommend them unless you have 1 or 2 other dining companions... Also, I wouldn recommend getting two orders of baked goods for a party of two. Clearly, we were over-ambitious. Ie had more enjoyable cocktails elsewhere, so I not sure if I get mixed drinks there again. We ordered the Il have a chocolate martini, playground meltdown (it had butter in it O_o), and waking up to canon fire. All very interesting, but perhaps more appealing to others. Cocktails were reasonably priced considering the establishment ($11). Rainbow Room, NYC, anyone? Urgh. In summary, I had a really great time at Range, and while it not a cheap place, it a lot of fun for a small group (i recommend 2-4) of friends/ a date., went to range last night for dinner (sunday).we got there 5 mins early and we were seated right on time for our reservation. we sat in the back past the kitchen. the restaurant is HUGE.our server was very nice and explained that the meal would be served family style (reminds me of blue duck tavern) so that we can all get a ange of flavors. cheesy but i get it. we were recommended to order 3-4 four plates per person, there were four of us, we ordered 9 and were stuffed. i would probably bump it down to like 2-3 per person.we ordered the bread basket per the recommendation of a recent washington post review. it was good, but a lot of bread, i would probably recommend it for larger parties/first time visit because it comes with some pretty awesome spreads. my two favorites were the cornbread with bacon marmalade and the cheddar chive biscuit.the potted foie gras was to die for. the kale caeser was nice, it is thinly sliced so it is light and easy to eat. we had the kimchi pasta with uni and the goat cheese ravioli (a must!).for proteins we had the lamb (good), bone marrow (not as good as blue ducks), and the sturgeon (way too salty). i wasn impressed by either but bryan is known for his specialty cuts. i guess i need to be a little more daring next time and get the sweetbreads and heart.the sides were awesome. we had the sweet potato puree (looked like baby food but was really delicious), mushrooms, and fried brussel sprouts (another must!). for dessert we finished with the bread pudding. that was so so. if you are too full they have small bite desserts which i think is a really nice option.there is so much more to try so i will definitely be coming back.if you like pizza, supposedly it is the same as 2 amy. which i heard is the best pizza in DC. oh and i like their denim napkins, i am going through a major chambray phase right now., We went this past weekend, Jan 11th and it was a fabulous experience. Our waiter made it easy to understand ordering and pacing. I felt we got just the right amount of food, and the service timing was excellent. Whatever early issues they had when they opened appeared to be fixed. We were tucked in a corner, so it was still romantic. Everything we ate was excellent, the sommelier helped us with perfect wine choices. It was familiar enough to recognize Voltaggios style, especially since we love Volt, but unique too. There is a lot of fun in the menu and the restaurant, which made not only for excellent food, but really just a good time. I only wish we had a bigger party so we could have tried even more food. We had oysters, tuna, bread, the cheese plate, NY strip, cap of ribeye, pork cheeks and yuumy dessert. We were satisfied but not overstuffed. I can not wait to go back!, Summary: delicious, but not ready for primetime.After dining at VOLT last year, we were delighted to try RANGE. Chef Voltaggio food did not disappoint. It was up to the high standards of VOLT, even on a more casual scale. Cheese and charcuterie were served with delicious bread and confits. Salad and side dishes were tasty. The beef dish we had was simply outstanding.That said, the restaurant service is not up to snuff. Issues we had:1. Our waitress suggested we order around 4 plates per person, which was way too much. She suggested we start with two bread dishes, even though we were also ordering two cheeses and proscuitto. She neglected to tell us that the cheese/charcuterie themselves come with bread. The two of us ended up with a skillet of cornbread that two people coudln possibly eat alone, pita bread/hummus, two cheeses, prosciutto, and three types of bread. We asked questions as we ordered, and at no time did she tell us that bread came with the cheese. The menu was confusing, and didn indicate that either. We didn finish half of what we ordered, but were still practically full before our salad came.Our waitress suggested to the table next to us (easily within earshot, after we had ordered) that the two women there only order 2-3 plates per person. Additionally, she told them NOT to order any bread because the cheese they were ordering came with bread. Needless to say, this disparity was frustrating. 2. The food came out whenever it was ready, which meant we got a salad and fried potatoes (read: French fries, which was not clear on the menu) at the exact same time. Additionally, many things on the menu were a bit misleading like this. flatbread with chickpeas and roasted garlic was pita bread & hummus. Delicious, but not what was listed. Same thing about the fried potatoes with parsley and lemon being French fries.3. Once our main dish was served (again, delicious!), our waitress was nowhere to be found. We sat for at least 15 minutes after finishing our food, waiting to order dessert. When we did order dessert, she offered to bring the chocolate cart (!). We waited at least ten minutes for that to come. Instead, she brought us the check. She asked whether the chocolate cart had come, we said no, and she kindly offered to comp us whatever we had planned to order. At this point, we had already finished our desserts, but I still wanted to try the truffle, so we waited. After another ten minutes, she checked on us; it hadn come, she went to get it again. After waiting again for several minutes, we paid our bill, and were gathering our things when she came by with the cart. She told us what the chocolates were, and we both asked for the dark chocolate truffle she described. She left, we tried the truffle, and it was a blueberry truffle on the inside. Not the dark chocolate I wanted. Just another missed mark for the evening. Minor complaints: 4. The water attendees were amazing. I drink a lot of water, but I never once ran out. My minor complaint, though, is that was must have been asked 10+ times whether we were drinking still or sparkling. My husband drank one, I drank the other, and no one remembered. It wasn a huge deal, but it also was a brief interruption every ten minutes. They could easily avoid this by using one glass for each type of water. After such amazing service at VOLT, this felt a bit sloppy.5. When we got there on time for our reservation, they had no idea what to do with us. I work on Sunday mornings, so we went early (6:30, early for us) on a Saturday night. It took three hostesses and the manager to figure out where to seat us, and we had to stand around awkwardly while they got their act together.6. The waitress -- though friendly -- rushed us through ordering. As mentioned above, the menu wasn that straightforward. When we ask a question, she often direct us towards one or two specific dishes, but not really give the information we had asked for.7. When we arrived, we were seated next to a table with five kids who were LOUD. As we were walking to our table, the children were running in the aisles. This is not ok. If they want to accept families and small children, fine, but put them somewhere that it ok to make a ruckus. 8. It was my husband birthday. Don ask whether it a special occasion, if you plan to do nothing about it.I am certain that Voltaggio will correct these things. This will ultimately be a great addition to the DC scene. But after being spoiled by impeccable service at VOLT, this experience left us pretty cold. We live downtown and can choose any night from a variety of well-run restaurants. Traveling up to Chevy Chase for great food with bad service won be on our dance card again soon, and we certainly can recommend RANGE until they get these kinks worked out.I hope Chef Voltaggio will consider opening a VOLT or something similar downtown, but only if it is up to the same standards as the original., *01/12/2013: Exclusive VIP Evening with Civil Cigar LoungeJust keep the wood-fire pizza (meat and potato, some spicy sausage/spinach combo, cheese) coming and Im a happy camper. The other foods (assorted cheese, breads, etc.) desserts (sugar-coated marshmallows, chocolate topped blondies, etc.) werent so bad, either.Note: After your meal, check out Civil Cigar Lounge -- adjacent to Range -- for some cigars and cocktails., The food was very high quality, but the menu is strange, huge, confusing, and does not seem coherent. The service was pretty terrible, and we were seated about a half hour after our reservation - and they kept saying it would be just a few minutes so I didnt get a drink in the meantime. The food came out in a very strange order (my husband got a bread dish that I couldnt eat because of the meat. LONG wait and then practically all of my food came out. Another long-ish wait and the rest of his food came out). We never did get one of our dishes, and the waitress said shed take it off the check (but then didnt - we had to get a manager to fix it). Three stars only because the food was very high quality, but it was overall a pretty big disappointment, especially having been to Volt previously. I think it will improve, but it seems to be trying to be a bit too much., While I was hesitant about going to dinner tonight after seeing some of the reviews, I am extremely happy to report that we had fantastic prompt service, delicious food, and an overall great time. We sat at the counter in front of the bakery section and had a great conversation with the chefs and bakers. Our server was almost overly polite and very prompt. As mentioned, the water guys are all over it...never letting your glass get beyond half empty. Only downside was the format of the wine list. I love wine, and I get that breaking it down by varietal can be boring, but when it takes me 5 minutes to figure out where the sauvignon blancs are located under some clever name like fierce and tangy or something of the type, it wasn the best way to start off the meal. Luckily, they have two master sommeliers (one of which I was told was 1 out of 18 total women in the USA to be ranked a master. Overall, I can wait to go back and continue to try out the menu. Diverse, great decor, and a fantastic meal., Who doesn love going to new popular restaurants shortly after theye opened (and worked out possible kinks)? Noise: A little too loud for my taste. I have a feeling there no way to get away from it considering the size of the restaurant.Service: We had a party of 5. Once 4 of us were there they seated us immediately. Had a great table......really any table in the front is a good table with the glassed in space overlooking the atrium of the mall. The waiter was not far behind and asked if we like to order drinks while we waited. I will say that the menu is ALOT to take in at one time. The waiter brought drinks and asked if we wanted a rundown of the process. After waiting awhile longer, I got the feeling he was ready to get stuff going and got a little annoyed. The attitude doesn get much better the rest of the 3 hour dinner. He looked like he was ready to blow while we ordered our plates. Just a word of advice Myles (sorry dude), you need to establish a little more patience. Word of advise for people that get you as a server: Catch on quickly!Drinks: I am a vodka drinker so I got the Urban Conformist (pretty much Tea infused Vodka). Was not impressed. I shoulde got what my friend got.....the Mother-In-Law (bourbon, maraschino, bitters, curacao). If you can handle your liquor...get this drink. Order or Not: Good STRONG drink....Mother-in-Law!Food:**Bakers Basket of Bread: OMG.....this is pure heaven in doughy form!! Ie read reviews about the cornbread (mixed reviews) and I will say that the skillet cornbread at Founding Farmers is tastier (it missing something...can put my finger on it). The bacon marmalade on the cornbread (really just eating it with a spoon is possible) is like a little gift in a bowl. Order or Not: Definitely order.**Tastings of the Assorted Cheeses: People know me to be addicted to cheeses. If the tastings were larger then I would definitely get this on the next trip there. Order or Not: You can pass this....unless youe even more of a cheese whore than I am.**Lobster Mac & Cheese: I hope that the heaven that I go to is serving something like this!! Angels started singing when I ate this!! Needs a little bit more lobster though.....just a little. Order or Not: If you don order this........why are you here?**Goat Cheese Ravioli with Braised Meat Ragu: I know I would get reported for the things this dish did to me if I went into detail. I would pay $50 a plate for this....NO JOKE!! A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! Order or Note: see comment for the Lobster Mac & Cheese time 1,000,000.**Lamb Chops: Beware that if you like your lamb chops cooked more than (true) mid rare, make sure you specifically ask for a temp. They come true mid rare. Luckily, that how I like my lamb chops. They were season perfectly. Highly highly recommend. Order or Not: If youe a lover of lamb, just make sure you specify your preferred cooking temp and youl be amazed.**Sweet Potato Puree: Perfection. Order or Not: You better order this!!**Smoked Anson Mill Grits: Never had grits that were this TASTY!! Wish I had these every weekend when I making breakfast!! Order or Not: Yes (if youe a serious grits fan)....order this!!**Fried Brussel Sprouts: I am a true sprouts fan and my theory anything is good fried is true with this dish. I would fry brussel sprouts everyday if I knew how they do it (and season them). Order or Not: Yes, order this!**Beef Shins (special on the menu yesterday): This was a $62 special. Sounded insane but at the same time sounded delicious. The menu said it feeds 6 (but Myles said 4). Well....we ordered. What came to the table was amazing! It looked like it was cooked to perfection.......and it was. If you like brisket (it got that kind of texture) and the way it was smoked and seasoned.....100% on point.Dessert:**Warm Apple Crisp: I couldn even imagine eating any dessert after all the food above, but I was conned into sharing the apple crisp. WARNING: this is an apple crisp in a de-constructed form. It was still very tasty and was not an make you wanna lay down immediately size.**Other people ate stuff from the rolling candy bar. Nobody really said the dessert was fall out delicious. Order or Not: If you still have room for more food.....order something that makes your mouth water. If nothing does....just tap out now., my very handsome fiance and i took my future in laws here to celebrate my mom-to-bes birthday. overall, i really liked this place and thought it was a welcomed new treat of classy but good food to the area. the menu is a bit tricky, as they say that all the menu is meant as a small plate, but that the prices look like individual plate pricing. VOLT got yo wallet!below is the rundown of what to get and what not to get:what to get:1. bread basket - lots of amazing breads and plenty for four. the cornbread comes in a little cast iron pan with this salty spread that is ah-mazing. 2. hanging tender- in MEDIUM RARE. dont diss the meat and get it any other way, its best medium rare, so soft and tasty. oh and the best part about getting a steak? the SHUN KNIFE that they give you. SHUN= one of the highest quality, most expensive knives in the area. its a showstopper if youre a knife fanatic. 3. sturgeon- tasty fishwhat not to get:1. new york strip- overpriced @ $45 and not that great2. striped bass - tasted weirdsides to get:um all of them! we got the brussel sprouts, mushrooms, roasted potatoes and gobbled them all up. all were perfectly seasoned. i would recommend getting 3 sides for 4 people- that was plenty for us., The strangest thing about Range is that it inside a mall. A nice mall, mind you, but it feels a little out of place. It doesn help that the ma3etre dstand is outside the restaurant proper, so you find yourself loitering in a strange place.This disconnect immediately disappears when you enter the restaurant. As other reviewers have mentioned, the place is huge, though it does feel a little cramped near the bar. We were seated in one of the back rooms, so we didn have any issues with noise, though lost the impact of the large windows.On to the food: it small plates, so you have an opportunity to try a lot of different dishes. And the menu is expansive, so youl want to try everything. Now, small is in quotes because the servings are pretty generous, particularly for two people. With that in mind, following the 2-3 dish recommendation given by our server (we ordered five dishes for two people) left us with significant leftovers. The pizza alone could easily serve two people for dinner.My biggest recommendation: go with a large (6+ person) group.Everything we got was tasty: Virginia ham (B+; sliced thin with pears), fried brussels sprouts (A+; fish sauce vinaigrette sounds weird but is great), sweetbreads (A), potato and meatloaf pizza (B+; a little hard to eat around the large slices of potato), and the bread basket (A; lots of variety and interesting spreads)., My boyfriend got us reservations here on a Sunday night and we were both super excited to try Bryan Voltaggio new restaurant in DC. I wish we didn have such high hopes because the experience was a bit of a disappointment. The problem lies not with the conception (5 stars) of the food, but with the execution (2 stars). Perhaps this will improve after Range is over the growing pains that come with new restaurant/new-staff-learning-curves, but until then I only give it a shaky 3 stars. It is a shame to see such masterfully conceptualized dishes butchered by negligence and inadequate training of staff.The dishes we ordered:- Skillet cornbread, bacon marmalade: a great starter. The cornbread is rather large, but it was paired perfectly with the herbaceous butter and bacon marmalade. I normally not a fan of bacon, but this marmalade is amazing! The cornbread is on the dry side, but the rich, smoky bacon marmalade shined brightly through this dish and ultimately saved the unexciting cornbread.- Potted foie gras, apple compote, brioche: Ever since the first time Ie tasted it, I have LOVED foie gras. Needless to say, this was the dish I was looking forward to the most the entire night. Unfortunately, after this experience I will need to tread carefully and think twice before ordering anything with the name foie gras in it. First of all, has anyone ever heard of portion control? Good things should come in small quantities, which is especially true for something as rich and delicate as foie gras. What we got was a rather large pot of foie gras, which was both overwhelming in taste and quantity. I not sure how this was prepared, but it had a sickening cured meat taste to it and after a few bites, I started feeling nauseous. The 4 measly triangles of brioche bread and teaspoon of apple compote were laughable compared to the tub of foie gras we were served. I think there was enough foie gras for a large party and several breadbaskets. Though I did not fancy the foie gras taste by itself, eating it spread on the brioche and topped with the apple compote was actually really good. Too bad there was only enough apple compote for about 2 bites and then it was just bread and foie gras...and more foie gras. Oh, and if you let the foie gras sit for a few minutes at room temperature, the top layer (duck fat) starts resembling the watery melted wax atop a burning candle. The message with this dish is: Eat lots and eat FAST.- Kampachi crudo, pine nuts, lemon, coriander: the pairing of flavors had potential to be great, but it was way too mild. A bit more citric acid would have brightened up my palate instead of leaving me feeling as blah and bland as the dish.-Brussel sprouts: though not a eature itemon the menu, ironically this was my favorite dish of the night. I loved the char on the brussel sprouts and it was the only dish that was seasoned to pair well with the other dishes. Alone, it was slightly salty and a little greasier than I woulde liked, but still good.-Leg of lamb, root vegetable puree: in addition to the foie gras, one of those -wish-I-known-not-to-orderitems. Our server talked us into ordering an additional feature item instead of getting full off the breadbasket. In hindsight, I think he was more concerned about price than in quality of the entr39e. We got duped into paid $29 for 2 pieces of lamb that were mushy, bland, and whose fat-to-meat ratio read heart attack. Oh, and did I mention it was glistening in a bowl of grease? -Kimchi linguini, uni, bay scallops: my second favorite dish of the night. I was able to taste a slight hint of kimchi, but I wish it came out stronger. Instead much to my dismay and confusion, my taste buds kept registering ketchup. Despite it all, the uni hidden amidst the swirls of linguini was a nice addition. The scallops were impossibly small though--wished they were bigger and less salty. -Black cod, bbq hazelnuts, sorghum: cod was overcooked and wasn seasoned at all. What a waste of fish. The bbq hazelnuts were a nice touch, but the sorghum only served to make things so much more the blander.To sum it up, some dishes were over seasoned while others were not seasoned at all. And they definitely need to lay off the grease--not everything tastes good when you cook it with a stick of butter. Sadly, the highlight of our visit was not the food, but the cool sliding semi-electronic doors and the glass sink in the bathroom. Not really what I expected to take away from Bryan Voltaggio new restaurant, but hey, maybe it will improve with time? Until then, Il get my good eats elsewhere., We had a good meal here - lobster mac and cheese for my restaurant savvy kids (10 and 13), pizzas for the grownups, kale salad, banana bread pudding, espresso and salted caramel ice creams. No wine, lots of water. Our waiters were friendly and very nice (the water pourer was especially active). They offer both sparkling and still water; I assume they will charge you for the sparkllng, but nobody tells you that.We had no reservations (6:15 Tuesday night) and had to sit at the chef counter, which was interesting, except I thought maybe we get some attention from the kitchen chefs-other than a how is everything from (I believe) Chef Voltaggio, we got nothing other than a bit of eye contact. Two main beefs: the pretty hostess/greeter was downright rude, telling us there were no tables and practically willing us to leave, even though the guy helping her said he could seat us and though I just seen on Open Table that they had tables for 4 at that time. Also, the confection cart they wheel around at the end is misleading: they don tell you that they will charge you for any of the goodies. As Ie been to fine restaurants that give you cookies/popcorn, etc. as a gift at the end, I wasn sure if the candy/brownies were free and didn ask. And of course they weren. I felt it was inappropriate not to tell us, especially as we just ordered dessert and so obviously weren looking for more sweets. We will probably go back, but I expected a little more for my $140 meal., Being a huge fan of Bryan Voltaggio from Top Chef, I couldnt wait to try out his new place just 15 minutes from my apartment. It was very good, and did not disappoint. I would say it was slightly less sophisticated than VOLT, but I thought the food was better and with it being small plates, I got to try more things. I went with 2 other people, and we shared the following things:Cheddar and Jalapeno Biscuits with Pepper Jelly- amazing. the biscuits were soft and fluffy and the pepper jelly was perfect with it.Goat Cheese Ravioli with Meat Ragu- one of my favorite of the night. It is presented in the shape of balls, but then you cut into it and see that goat cheese, it was really great. and the meat ragu was fantastic and very flavorful. Personally, one of my favorites of the night.Hanging Tender- a simple piece of steak, sliced. Amazingly flavorful. I thought it was great, but the other 2 people I went with thought it was their favorite of the night.Leg of Lamb with Root Vegetables- My favorite of the night. The lamb was perfectly seasoned and sliced, and was crispy where it was supposed to be and tender elsewhere. Served with root vegetables, which were kinda creamy in a good way, and a green puree, which I still dont know what it is, but it was awesome.Bass with Hazelnuts- nothing special. Didnt taste like much. Our least favorite of the night.Brussels Sprouts- after having a disappointing rendition of Brussels sprouts at a restaurant last week, I was very happy with these. They were crispy, and clearly both roasted and friend. Very flavorful. Great dish. Cauliflower- it was good, but it was supposed to have zaatar on it, and there was no zaatar. But still good.Dessert: Bread Pudding-- okay, but honestly mine is better. It looks like it was made in a muffin tin, which made it more like a muffin than a true bread pudding.Salted Caramel Ice Cream- awesome.Goat Cheese Cheesecake- very good. this was my personal favorite dessert. All in all, it was a great meal. They say you need 3-4 dishes per person, but we stopped believing most places that say that-- we were fine with 2-3/person. Ran us $45 with tax and tip, but no drinks. We consider this a reasonably priced meal, that we can return to repeatedly. I cant wait to go back and try more of their food!, Awesome - great food, chefs were super nice and even Bryan came over to chat with us. Great Service too. The hosts could be better tho!, Dropped in after late night movie. Place was ablaze with people and excitement.Maybe it was just us, but they may have worked out the service issues, as our waiter was excellent and the food came out very quickly.Have discovered a new favorite dish in life for me - the goat cheese ravioli balls in meat ragout. The small cassoulet as a special was superb, and the foie gras was a lovely large portion with wonderful brioche. All in all, Range is a lively hot spot with great food and decor., I don know what look they were going for here with the uniforms but they looked quite comfortable in the denim jeans of their choice, button down blue oxfords, Chuck Taylors and what appeared to be workshop apron!! Its a pooled house and it seemed that everybody was hustling ! Table service is great and feel free to sit at the side bar areas. You will get great service from there too! Our server (Corine I think) had great menu insight!  Skillet corn bread with bacon marmalade needs a little punch from the south with a bit more butter and egg but the diced bacon marmalade was a welcomed condiment! A 6 dick of hot fluffy goodness brought awesomeness ( yes that is a word) to a whole new level!! $3!! This portion will feed four people easy! In retrospect, I would order the Bakers basket with spreads for $10 next trip! An assortment of Focaccia with tomato ham jam and Cheddar chive biscuits with pepper jelly looked good too... MUST SAVE ROOM FOR FOOD!!We choose to bypass the usual suspects of cured meats, terrines, pates and shellfish.... Pretty much overdone in the restaurants now.My only issues were the timing of the dishes but that will happen in small plate restaurants. The biggest issue was the clearing of plates and silverware.... FOR NO REASON!!! My friend served herself from a larger plate and her silverware and plate were removed by an over zealous bus person. A single malt scotch disappeared and reappeared too!We started off with the Kale Caesar with diced Whitmore farm eggs. The texture of the kale just didn do it for me.. No flavor in the dressing Braised Pork Shank with grits and what appeared to be a pork demi was tender but lacked in the flavor department. You need to put together the perfect bite and make sure that you add the demi and grits with each bite.Cassoulet was awesome! A thick slice of seared pork belly, cannellini beans, house made sausage and confit! The beans needed a little boost of flavor but everything else was spot on!I ordered a Pappardelle that I thought had some sort of veal cheek thing going on but I think a cured sliced meat thing happened instead with Hen of the woods mushrooms. No biggy.. Great flavor and LONG strands of al dente pasta!Snake River Top Cap of Round was very lean and cook to a perfect medium rare but not knock me off my feet. Lean is no marbling and that means for the most part short on flavor. Next time I think I will opt for the Roseda top cap of Rib Eye or the Eye of Rib Eye!Fried potatoes with parsley and lemon were just ok.. Not cooked to order it seemed.. Salsify was quite tasty!SWEETS!!!Way too much to get in too! They offer House made ice creams and sorbets, tarts , bourbon banana bread pudding! Skip to the other side of the menu to the Candy Counter! Chocolate truffle like offerings, brittles, biscotti and brownies. You can actually make a selection of chocolate truffle like offerings in groups of 5, 8 and 16! This place is great and it will take you and a small army several visits to taste the entire menu but I think it totally worth it!!, I came into my dinner with Range with very high expectations after my my previous meal at VOLT was one of the best dining experiences of my life. Range wasnt quite as good, but definitely worth a visit.Range is huge - it boasts more than 300 seats - but there were sections that were closed off on the Thursday we came for a visit. Seeing the empty seats made it a little frustrating when we werent seated until nearly 30 minutes after our 8:15 reservations. Nevertheless, we made the best of the situation by trying a couple of the inventive cocktails at the bar. Im glad I tried the Vegan Sacrifice - made with scotch, housemade ginger ale, cayenne pepper and meat ice - but wouldnt order it again. The meat ice (frozen veal stock) is a gimmick. At first, it added a pleasant saltiness to the drink. As it melted (which it doesnt do nicely or uniformly) it became overpowering and I felt like I was drinking a cold alcoholic soup.We were finally seated beside the wood fired oven, which made for a nice back drop to our meal. Things started off excellently with the bread basket and spreads. Highly recommended. The corn bread was very good and taken to another level with the accompanying bacon marmalade. The cheddar biscuits with pepper jam and the country bread were also fantastic.Our server recommended that we order three plates per person and we ordered several of the dishes she identified as her favorites. The food, presented as its ready, had some highs and lows. The yellow fin tuna crudo was fresh and tasty, and the puffed jasmine rice cakes and avocado sauce paired nicely with it. The goat cheese ravioli and meat ragu left a bit desiring: the pasta was a little thicker than expected and the ragu had a few very chewy chunks of meats and needed a bit of salt. (Note: it was my girlfriends favorite dish of the night, so reasonable minds can differ). The roasted beets were good, but the burrata felt like an afterthought and the dish didnt stand out from what you could get elswhere. The bacon and charred onion pizza had a very good chewy, thin crust, but the bacon didnt feel like bacon. The pork cheeks were tender and flavorful - a real highlight - and the mostarda contrasted nicely with the smooth celeriac. The hanging tender was simply prepared and delicious. One of the better steak dishes I have had in a long while. For dessert, we ordered the bourbon banana bread pudding and were pretty disappointed. Its possible we were over full from the rest of our meal, but we both found it very dense, a little dry, and relatively flavorless. The accompanying chocolate stout ice cream was delicious though.Overall, it was a great meal, though they still have a few timing issues to work out. Our first three dishes came out virtually at the same time. The pizza followed a few minutes later. But there was a good 20- or 25-minute gap between the pizza and the pork cheeks and steak, which felt a bit long. The bussers were also quick to clear the table, which was nice, except for the few times that we werent quite finished with the plates they wanted to abscond with.I also wanted to make one quick note on the ambience. The restaurant is located inside a mall / hotel and the glass walls that run along the majority of the restaurant invites that all inside. In particular, you sit over top of an atrium with flashing brightly colored lights that are distracting and clash with the interior of the restaurant. Between that and the sheer size of the restaurant, youre not going to get an intimate dining experience. That said, it was nice to see that Mr. Voltaggio carried over the laid back, almost playful attitude toward fine dining that he brings to VOLT (seen, for example, in the wait staff uniforms: denim and Chuck Taylors)., Go here, bring friends, try everything on the menu....bring money!!, I was so excited to try this restaurant and left very disappointed. My husband and I made reservations six weeks in advance. When we arrived, we were initially seated at what seemed like a bar with a direct view in the kitchen. It was awful. The lay out of this restaurant is terrible with lots of seats at what seems like the bar.We asked to be reseated at an actual table. After a bit of an ordeal, we finally had a real table. Our waiter was awful. THe menu was confusing and he didnt explain it at all. We didnt know that plates were small and came out when they were ready. We had too many entrees. The entire experience was odd. And the bar is near the tables which makes the restaurant very, very loud. They also do not validate parking. I was expecting so much more., Had such a great experience last night at Range. I know that it isn comfort food, and there were some things on the menu that were definitely not served in my house growing up, but I would have to describe it as very homey. Everything is so well thought out even down to the drink menu. I love the catchy names, and the selection of craft liquors was impressive. We were a party of four so that gave us a chance to sample a lot of things since it is served homestyle and portions are made to share. My favorite dishes were the beet and goat cheese salad, the raw tuna, the leg of lamb and the Brussels sprouts. There was nothing on the table that was bad, just less great. I can wait to go back and try more things. We stayed in our comfort zone with this visit, and we followed the suggestions of our server, who was great, but I definitely want to try some of the more adventurous dishes.I will definitely go back! A great restaurant close to home :-)., Went with a friend during restaurant week, unfortunately they did not offer a restaurant week menu. Regardless, the food, staff, and service were phenomenal. I arrived early for my reservation and they seated me anyway, asked for my friend name to guide her to our table, and we weren rushed through service. Ie been to popular restaurants similar to this where servers will rush you through dinner to get to the next customer. Range style is one of a tasting menu. Dishes are smaller and come out in stages. If you were rushed through, it would totally kill the experience. Range nailed it with everything. I definitely recommend this restaurant and can wait to come back!Also, above all, FOOD WAS AMAZING. There wasn a singe dish we ordered that I wouldn order again. Yum!, AMAZING. I was drunk on food for hours after leaving here (and although I did have a pretty fantastic cocktail, Im pretty sure it was not just my BAC that made me feel that way).Theres something really amazing about Bryan Voltaggios approach to restaurants. I love that he makes spectacular food available at reasonable prices and in an environment that isnt pretentious. We felt comfortable having a birthday dinner here, chatting, and laughing, and enjoying sharing our food. We ordered a lot, but our favorites/tips are the following:Order the cheese plate, they are all wonderful and its a great deal. The portions are nearly the same as if you ordered each cheese separately, and the price is only that of about 2 cheeses.Order sides! We enjoyed them more than our entrees. We ordered the sunchokes, brussels sprouts, and the (dreamily garlicky) mashed potatoes and loved every bite of them. The salsify was a group favorite!The chocolate ganache tart is paired with an ice cream that I nearly licked off the plate.One of us commented that all of the servers seemed genuinely friendly and excited to be there. They really made the experience pleasant and fun. We ate and basked in gastronomic glory a bit longer than we probably should have (we didnt leave until a little after 11 pm), but we didnt even realize it since the staff never let on that it had gotten so late., The food here seemed dirty and not one of the dishes was served hot. The wait staff are great, however., I was looking forward to this restaurant for weeks. The first time we went, we had to wait for about 30 minutes past our reservation time. Some of the plates we ordered were AMAZING- crudos and kale caeser but other things were a bit underwhelming- steak. This is a great place to go for after work cocktails and to share some small plates at the bar. Their house-made vodka soda is delicious!, Ordered cornbread(good-- accompanying bacon marmalade was excellent), tuna focaccia-- alright like an open faced tuna sandwich, two pizzas( decent) , the seamless stuffed pasta-- not balanced, goat cheese overwhelms everything, the kimchi uni pasta--- bland, no kimchi or uni flavor, and lobster boudin-- boudin was good, but couscous just tasted like butter. I loved the beet salad, but not as well received by others at the table. The place was overwhelmed and it seemed like they had trouble dealing with the volume of customers. Would not return, I really liked this place but mostly for the sides, desserts and ambience. The service was a little chaotic -- guessing from the multiple kitchens that things are coming from, but all of the food was good. The bests were sides and staters like beet salad, everything mashed potatoes, cauliflower. And the desserts were all delish. My friends liked the pork and lamb. Some things on the menu seemed just to be here for shock value and not taste (beef heart) and the menu descriptions were pretentious and overly complicated. All in all, its a good special occasion spot and a good addition to the area., Wow! What fun! Had an amazing meal with lots of brilliant surprises. The portions were very generous (small plates barely applies) and the prices were very, very reasonable. Staff was engaging and helpful. Must try: bacon marmalade; lobster (it a whole lobster in there!); ham tasting platter (plenty for lunch the next day); any dessert or confection. We had 8 plates...no misses...no disappointments. Truly fun and relaxed., Having reveled in several outings to VOLT, I had high hopes for Range but left, quite frankly underwhelmed. Wine offering were outstanding, but several of the cocktails were licking plastic while swallowing cough medicine....adventurous concoctions are one thing, but they need not be offputting. Staff was friendly and attentive, but we felt over-served -- do there need to be two people performing almost every function, or were they not trained to advise of comrades in training? Meat and cheese apps were wonderful, as they should have been given the crossover with VOLT. Pasta with beef cheeks bursted with flavor without feeling heavy, and rabbit roulade was spectacular; however, the osso bucco was undercooked and underflavored, and it did not fall off the bone as it should have-the paired reduction seemed to have come from some other pan. Divine bittersweet chocolate mousse slice with ice cream and candied popcorn, but the confectionery cart was overboard---if I want cookies and crap, Ill order from the menu or buy it from the counter, but I dont need it rolled around to me. Lastly, the decor. Its screaming trendy so hard, it felt dated by the time we left. Some elements taken from the 70s, others like the bathrooms from a future time in a galaxy far, far away. Simple and timeless would help Range tell less frenetic and more like a place Id be happy to visit over and over again., Cocktails are amazing so make sure you try. I do understand that restaurants similar to this are trying to do family style meals (Im Vietnamese and have been eating that way my entire life) but can we get some more portions?id have to say that its probably my number one complaint about this place and I even had hair on my plate!We had a party of 7 and the portions were just too small to share among us all. If you come with 4 or less, youll be fine but make no mistake that if you bring more, youll likely want to order two servings for all to share. Some dishes are amazing like pork cheeks, cauliflower and ricotta ravioli while a dish like the lamb tasting was standard for any restaurant. The kimchi linguini also lacked kimchi but I can see how others would like it. The space itself is really nice and accommodating. Staff was phenomenal and you must try some of the desserts. Oh and take a trip to the bathroom, seeing glass bowl sinks make me feel like a kid. I really dont know why., We had a fantastic time at Range. Range is a very different restaurant when compared to Bryan Voltaggios starter restaurant, Volt, in Frederick; it is trendy, loud, great for groups, nice bar, etc. Yes, there will always be a special place in our hearts for the ever intimate Volt, but having Range just a taxi/metro ride away is much easier than an hour drive to Frederick, MD. We had a late reservation here on a Saturday night, and the place couldnt have been busier. There was never a table empty. Excited diners were anxiously awaiting their turn to be seated...and we were one of them. We enjoyed a few drinks at the bar and made our way to our seats for the evening. I felt like this restaurant just kept going. The use of space was absolutely amazing; raw bar, bakery, endless wine racks....you name it they had it.We started our much anticipated evening with the cheese sampler plate, yellow fin tuna, and the cornbread with bacon marmalade. The cheese plate was a great deal, and couldnt have been better. The yellow fin tuna was very light and absolutely delicious...I think the serving size was a little small for the price. The cornbread by itself would have been plain, good but plain. The addition of the sweet and savory bacon marmalade just complimented it so nicely and made this classic homestyle side stand out. We finished off the night with the roseda beef hanging tender, which was incredibly tender and cooked to perfection. We also had the grouper with lobster and cavier. It was also awesome. The flavors were well balanced and the grouper was crispy on the skin side and flaky and tender everywhere else. For a side, we ordered the brussels and couldnt have been happier that we did. We have had some really good brussels in the past, but these definitely take the cake. Dont think about the type of brussels that your mom made you for dinner back in the day. Range has taken them to a whole new level...at least for me they have. They are so flavorful and flash-fried to perfection...oh yeah, cant forget the pancetta.Cant wait to venture back and try some more amazing selections off their menu and this time we will save room for dessert!, This place is fantastic. I love Volt, but Range hits all the high marks for me. It has an upscale feel with a relaxed vibe to enjoy these wonderful food creations., We arrived for an 8:45 reservation. We were seated in the far back of the restaurant next to a large party. The noise was so loud my friend and I couldnt even have a normal conversation. We literally couldnt hear each other. Our waitress took 20 minutes to even approach us and introduce herself. After we ordered drinks my friend received her wine in 10 minutes. It took another 15 minutes to receive my beer. Keep in mind we have been sitting for almost 45 minutes and havent even ordered a starter dish. When it was time to order 50 minutes after sitting down, the menu was not explained to us properly. It was extremely confusing. We ordered salads, cornbread, pizza, pasta and brussels sprouts. To your credit the food was delicious. However the order that we received the food made no sense. The order went: pizza, cornbread, salads, brussels sprouts and finally pasta? At the end of the meal I looked at my watch and we had been seated for more than 2 hours and since the service was so slow we could only order 2 drinks in that time period. In my opinion that is unacceptable., My friend booked a table for 6 about a month ago it was for Friday night at 9 PM. The restaurant was packed. I walked up to the hostess, who was too busy with something else she was rude to me when I wanted to check in with her. If the hostess cannot host or cannot keep her cool - she shouldnt be there. My friends and I were told the table was not ready so we waited at the bar. The restaurant was no doubt packed even at the bar where getting a drink was challenging. The sauvignon blanc my friend ordered for me without looking at the drink menu was very good. Another observation was how much it echoed with the noise in the restaurant.We walked through the lounge area, the extensive open kitchens (with Bryan in it) before we were seated at the very end of the restaurant. Its a large restaurant. The restaurants contemporary and sleek decor contrasted with the organic elements in the placemats and tableware. The menu featured a wide cateogry from crudos to charcuterie to cheeses to salads to grilled dishes to pizzas to desserts. The server told us this was a tapas style where each person would order 3-4 plates. We were overwhelmed by the menu took a while before deciding on what to order. I ordered the striped bass crudo, goat cheese ravioli with ragu, beef heart and sweetbreads.Dishes I enjoyed and wanted more:Goat cheese ravioli with ragu - curious how the flavor could work but they worked very well! It was an amazingly tasty dish the chunky meat in the ragu was well seasoned. For this reason it showcased the chefs craft at combining flavors.Ham charcuterie - pleasantly surprised again by the 4 cuts of hams that were served. When one thought of ham as the processed meat in sandwiches Ranges charcuterie offered wonderful artisanal cured meats with amazing flavors.Veal Sweetbreads - it said winter truffles I didnt taste much of that but the celeriac went very well with the sweetbreads.Brussel sprouts with pancetta - nicely roasted great caramelized flavors combined with the pancetta.Fennel, arugla and parmesan - appetizing salad fennel had a nice crunch Meyer lemon tart - it was very tasty especially with the passionfruit ice cream.Dishes that were good:Cheese plateHanging tender Roasted potatoes with bacon and caramelized onionsKale caesarBread puddingDish that needed workVeal heart, chimchurri - it was simple dish served by itself however there were hard pieces of the heart that were unchewable even if I was a caveman. The nice parts though were very flavorful tasted pretty much like a medium rare steak.The only other thing was....Running out of chocolates in the cart - ok we sat at 9 PM and ate late but shouldnt they leave some chocolates for us? We watched it came and went a few times during our dinner and when it came to time for dessert the cart was empty.On service:The greasy bowl of potato was hard to pass around I dropped it, lost my wine and almost all the potatoes. The server gave us another bowl. We ordered the meyer lemon tart but the meyer lemon ice cream came instead, again the server acted fast with getting the correct dessert plus she gave us the ice cream. She was helpful with cleaning up the table and we joked that my friends only dessert wish was Bryan - she actually went to get him so she could have a photo with him. So sweet of the server. Bryan V. was a cool guy, thanks a lot.On price:We had a very nice sampling of the food at Range and it didnt blow our wallets. The quality of food matched the price point well. I would definitely go back if I can get a table., Ate there last Sunday night for family dinner with a party of 6 and was highly disappointed. We had waited weeks to go here and had heard great reviews but nothing about the restaurant lived up to them. The food we got was ok, but is way overpriced, the service was horrific, the atmosphere was very strange, and they dont even validate parking. I will definitely not be visiting again and will make sure to spread the word. They really need to step it up quite a bit to be at the level of food and service that would be expected for the price and location., Being a sucker for Top Chef I was jazzed to learn that former cheftestant Bryan Voltaggio of the dream Voltaggio twin-liciousness opened up a restaurant within the District. SO, off we went to Friendship Heights for Sunday brunch. It not your normal brunch place, no real breakfast items (beyond some pastries / baked goods) but heavier on the unch portion of brunch. If that OK, you will really dig Range.First, the space is awesome -- dark colors, brightly lit (thanks to the full wall of windows flanking one side of the restaurant that opens into the mall), and modern decor. To be in a mall, it just feels really cool. There are nine active kitchens in the restaurant - I sure there a strategy on how to order since items come out random from each kitchen.We ventured through various menus including the raw bar, bakery, salumeria, cold kitchen, wood oven, roasted and side dishes. So seven of the nine kitchens tested on our first trip. Not too shabby!It a great spot to just order a bunch of plates and share at the table -- sadly the cheeses aren listed on the menu posted on the website, we had this INCREDIBLE blue cheese. Soft, pungent, sharp...gah, my mouth is watering even thinking about it.I really hope that the location of this restaurant doesn prove to be a challenge or barrier for their success. I glad Bryan now has a restaurant in the city proper -- I hope Range does well. Il definitely be back next time I in DC!, I am a big fan of Top Chief so I decided to overlook that fact that we were seated in an empty part of the restaurant overlooking the mall center. While I ate I had to look at a Starbucks, the mall escalator and flashing lights on a big screen TV. However, then my meal arrived 20 minutes after my friends meal arrived. The food seems hit or miss. We started with the cheddar biscuits which were tasty. My friends food (the goat cheese ravioli) was amazing and mine (the lemon chicken) was alright but certainly nothing special. The manager did comp my meal, which I greatly appreciated. The service was slow but very friendly. Overall, I dont know if Ill be back but if I do I know what Ill be ordering and where Ill be requesting not to sit., Good service! Good prices. Great food. Youll like!!!, Given that I am a big fan of Bryan Voltaggios Volt, I was super excited to learn that he was opening a small plates place nearby. So, we gave it a try 2 weeks ago.The concept itself fits to our likings. Lots of choices served up in small plates so you can have a nice medley of food to sample. Very similar in concept to Chinese Dim Sum or Spanish Tapas. The decor itself was contemporary and chic. The service itself was pretty good although I think they still have a few kinks to work through. Overall, our waiter was fantastic and we also received a complimentary set of corn bread with bacon jam from management since it was served incorrectly to our table.Now, onto the food.... There were a few outstanding dishes that are must haves @Range, including the - buttery and flaky biscuit with jalapeno jam, the brussel sprouts, and the bone marrows. The kimchi uni pasta was a disappointment. The kimchi itself overpowered the subtle sea-saltiness of the sea urchin/uni. ( I definitely appreciate Eric Riperts rendition of uni pasta that preserves the uni flavor with butter, chive and caviar much more.) Other stuff we tried that were ok included the pork cheek and lobster mac and cheese. For dessert, we tried their rendition of the lemon bar and gingerbread marshmallow. Those were pretty good. They also pushed around a cart of homemade candies, chocolate, and baked good. Its hard to say no once you see that cart. Pretty good marketing! All in all, we enjoyed our experience at Range. Its definitely worth a try. Id give it a 3.5 star.
58|rasika-washington|For starters, I was having lunch solo at the bar and wanted a copy of the Post to read. I asked the bartender where I could get one. He said I should take a seat and hed take care of it. He took some change out of the tip jar and went out, bought a Post and brought it back for me. THAT is service.The food is bar none, the best Indian food Ive had in DC. (including Heritage, Indique) Many of the dishes are unique among restaurants here. The paratha was the best Ive had. (Sorry mom.)The environs are definitely the most upscale, though I found the bar space to be lacking.Two complaints: I ordered one dish and the bartender must have put in an order for the small size instead of the regular. The other is cost - lunch for 1 (w/o drinks or dessert) was about $35 all in., Delicious Indian Food but a Day Later I had a Bad Taste in My Mouth. Rasikia is a welcomed addition to the gallery place dining scene. Its location next to the new Wooly Mammoth space makes it perfect for catching a quick bite before the theater and the pre-theater menu is a fantastic value. The space is stylsh and the bar scene picks up at around 8:30 on the weekends. The food was bursting with flavors from India. We started with the Chaat Balak which is crispy fried baby spinach with chick pea flour and chutney. It was a delicious snack that had you craving for more beer to wash it down with. The spicy potato pancake was also tasty but I was bummed I stayed away from the crab cake that I had heard how good it was. For an entree dont miss the Black Sea Bass. It was one of the tastiest dishes Ive had out. My wifes Chicken Briani was flavorful and full of meaty thighs.Now for the bad taste. Our waiter added $.50 to his 20% tip just to make the charge a cool $100. I didnt understand why he would do such a thing. And despite the fantastic meal this one item has given us pause to return., Its all about the Chaat Balak here - the crispy fried baby spinach appetizer. WOW. it was soooooo goooood. The secret ingredient must be crack! Anyway, I went to Rasika for the first time today for a restaurant week meal, and was very happy with the service, the food quality, and the ambiance. The entree I got (lamb roganjosh) was very tasty although nothing you couldnt get in another Indian restaurant for a few bucks less. But the desserts were GREAT (the lychee icecream was particularly delicious) and you MUST order the aforementioned spinach appetizer. Be warned--you will be FULL after dining here. I think they also offer a pre-theater prix fixe menu, so consider this place if you are craving upscale Indian food before catching a performance at Woolly Mammoth or the Shakespeare Theater. I will be back to pay full-price here., My lunch there was pleasant. I immediately asked the server what the most spicy item on the menu was and she quickly rattled off a few appetizers and entrees. (I like spicy spicy) I ordered two of the mentioned items. Although tasty, it was far from spicy but nonetheless very appetizing. I had the calamari appetizer and the Goa shrimp entree. I will have to say that both items were cooked perfectly-the calamari was tender and not rubbery and the shrimp were large and fresh and perfectly steamed. My colleague ordered chili asparagus and the vegetable stew which she liked very much but again, far from spicy. The service was great - very attentive and unobtrusive. The decor was chic and calming although the bar seemed a bit bleak. I would try this place again but you better bring some cash with ya, it not cheap. My colleague and I agreed that the food here is a bit froo-froo and tailored more for the Washington business crowd. It not as authentic Indian cuisine as other places but nonetheless delicious. I prefer Indique for its traditional style and value., The best Indian Ie had in DC. The highlight was definitely the Palak Chaat, a crispy (fried?) spinach appetizer with yogurt, tamarind, and chutney -- I never heard of crispy spinach before, but this dish was so astonishingly flavorful, my husband and I practically inhaled it. For appetizers we also had the delightfully piquant Sev Batata Puri, biscuits topped with potatoes, mango, chutney, and tiny little vermicelli pieces. For entrees I had the dal (lentils) and gobhi mattar (cauliflower) -- both were very tasty as well. The waiter eagerly recommended a couple items (e.g. the spinach), which I suppose some sensitive customers might consider a tad opinionated, but I have to say that his recommendations were totally right on -- I was grateful to him for doing that because it helped us select our dishes well. Wee definitely coming back for more., As a generalization, I dont like Indian Food. But my old roommate LOVES it. So I had a special going away dinner during restaurant week here with her. And now Im a believer.The Palak Chaat was the freakiest, most delish thing Ive had ever. Just bizarre. Get it. I cant describe it.My entree was TEENY - but great. Her vegetarian sampler was great (dal, palak paneer, and 1 other thing). Her BFs dinner looked good.Dessert was great - but I couldnt tell you what I got if you paid me - probably Gulab Jamun. Very good place. A great place to do small plates with your group., I am an Indian food junkie (I am in the Acceptance phase) so, possibly, I have been to every Indian restaurant in the DC/VA area. I have been to a few of these places where the decor was extravagant, the prices where high, but the food was the same quality as any old hole in the wall. Not true of Rasika.Atmosphere wise, I liked the fact that this place is on quite a few top restaurants list, but it was not all starched, buttoned up types. For the most part the people at the other tables were wearing jeans. As long as youe eating new Indian you may as well be relaxed doing it.For the food: I totally, absolutely recommend the Palak Chaat, appetizer which is crispy spinach, topped with yogurt and chutney. Yummo! For an entree- get the lamb rogan josh. The meat was sooo tender Everything we had was first rate, and full of flavor and spice. Even though the plating is reminiscent of New American, the chefs not shy away from spices., India Fusion? Apparently it exists and its excellent. One of the best Indian experiences Ive had offering tasty versions of classic dishes mixed with the occasional original creation Im sure my Indian friends grandmas have not heard of.Slick & chic, good service, great wine, Rasika is a contender for best indian food in DC. It a high-end, indian food place, but still savory and delicious. My friend and I started with Seekh Kabob and Eggplant (both very good). We had the Lamb Roganjosh and Chicken Makhani for entrees (both excellent, but a little too mild for my taste), and topped it off with the Chocolate Samosa. It was a very good meal. We sat near the bar in the lounge area since we walked in without a reservation, but still found it to be comfortable and enjoyable. It owned by the same people who run Ardeo/Bardeo, Oval Room, 701, and Bombay Club. This is clearly the jewel of the bunch., Im not inclined to trust restaurants that dress up a cuisine that is perfectly good in its more humble, less expensive form, especially when their trendy interior betrays that the owners might have been more concerned with designing a hip lounge area than preparing good food. Yet, Rasikas take on Indian is interesting and fresh and offers a variety of preparations, griddle, tandoori and barbecue (not that you cant get that elsewhere, but I digress). If I recall correctly, I ordered the Lamb Roganjosh, which was delighful. I also recall us ordering the Palak Chaat or crispy spinach, which was also excellent. If you have to go to a Penn Quarter restaurant that insists on trendifying perfectly good cuisine, make it Rasika and not Rosa Mexicano., This place is totally a 4. Solid in almost every way - great food (roti and chicken makhani were stand-outs - salmon not the best), nice service, very hip/nice ambiance, and overall enjoyed it. But, not soul-shaking., Beautiful space, excellently executed courses, warm and gracious service. We were interested in the chefs tasting menu, and took the advice of our server who recommended one of us order the meat and the other order the vegetarian for a wider variety. This worked quite nicely.The crispy spinach appetizer is a must. The vandalu was incredible, but dont believe them when they say its not hot (I was sweating like a fat kid, but loved every minute). Then theres the chocolate samosa, covered in chocolate. Need I say more?, Best Indian Food. Period. YUM!I like to think of this place as a kick-ass high-end Indian restaurant., Rasika is now one of my favorite restaurants because of its excellent food and lovely atmosphere. Too bad they make groups of more than 8 do the tasting menu.My friend Kristen and I tried all of this food & drink:Champagne cocktail - Delightful and bubbly.Sauvignon blanc - Nice, mellow complement to dinner.Calamari Balchao - Soft and spicy. A welcome change from fried rubbery calamari with bland marinara sauce!Avocado Banana Chaat - Avocado, banana, and various other things mixed together and presented on a banana leaf. This was good but it was definitely my least favorite of all the foods.Sev Batata Puri - A delightful mix of biscuits, mangoes, potatoes, and chutneys-definitely my favorite Palak Paneer - Light texture and excellent paneer.Gobhi Mattar - Spicy cauliflower with peas. Had a nice kick.Garlic Naan - Warm, puffy, and perfectly spiced.Gulab Jamun with Ice Cream - Im still not sure what is in it. It resembles donut holes and is served warm with a flavorful honey sauce. The kaffir lime ice cream complemented it perfectly.EDIT (5/20/08): The cucumber basil rickey is awesome!, This is by far my favorite Indian food in the city! I would go through and name everything that I love about it, but it would take too long. Everything Ive had here is delicious. Their calamari appetizer was exceptional. Spicy though, very very spicy. It is a very refined take on Indian. Well done!, One of my favorites in DC. Fantastic Indian restaurant. The Goat cheese Naan is to die for, and all of the chutneys were fantastic. Service was very attentive and concerned if we did eat everything (they genuinely thought we didn enjoy it). But we did. I had the chicken Makhani as my entree and it was widely regarded as the best meal at the table. By the end of our lunch I was passing my bowl around for everyone to dip in. It was that good. The ice tea is a special Star of Africa tea that they bring in from Teaism. Most at our table loved it, but one sent it back and asked for a coke. An acquired taste perhaps? The only negative was the Chai afterwards. It was very mild and seemingly made with skim milk (a big mistake in my books). Otherwise it was a fantastic lunch and certainly one of my top 5 places to eat in DC., Very happy with my meal here. Thank you very much. I will return.I had the chicken Biryani. There was lots of chicken in the pot, which was surprising cause normally its mostly rice. There was so much chicken, that I couldnt finish it all. So bring a big appetite.The other members of my party were also happy with their meal.Returned here again for another fine meal. Palak Chaat was very good as was the bread basket. Had the Chicken Makhani entree which was very good., i find this is certainly the best indian restaurant in town. and unlike most of the other penn quarter restaurants it has its own charm and doesnt feel like just another of these DC cookie cutter restaurants. the bar is really well stocked with great cocktails and the bar/lounge (while sometimes a bit loud) is a really great place to meet up before going to Woolly Mammoth. The food as i said is great, the green chicken massala is probably one of my favorites and the bread is great. while staff is quite formally dressed and most people also dress up, you wont feel uncomfortable at all in a shirt with jeans., Very good food. They had a large selection of vegetarian plates. One thing I really liked was when they said it was spicy - it really was spicy. So many other places can make the food bland trying to accommodate everyone and forget that some people actually like a little zing to their dinner.The staff was very friendly and attentive. We never had an empty glass.One thing that was a bit annoying was that the restaurant was very loud. We ended up yelling at each other to carry on a conversation. So if you want a nice romantic place - this isnt for you., Very good fusion food. I was expecting some bizarre dishes but they were very true to the Indian tradition.My favorites were the chicken makhani and the saag paneer. Dessert wise, the pistachio kulfee was not delicious because of the overpowering mango sauce but the gulab jamun tasted exactly how my mother makes it -- perfect.The service is spectacular and they comped us $30 in appetizers because we had to wait 25 minutes past our reservation.I will come back for sure., holy shnikeys! for once, a restaurant fully lives up to its reputation. great ambiance, very modern looking interior... this is fairly upscale indian, so come with that in mind (that means you, anyone complaining about the prices - you get what you pay for here).service was very good, as the waiter was very helpful in recommending pretty much everything we ordered, and he hooked us up pretty phat.dont miss the mango shrimp.. my only complaint is that i couldnt order it as an entree. also had the black cod and the tandoori chicken. both were excellent. hoping to get back soon to try the tasting menu. bravo rasika, my new dc fav.., The food was amazing. My friend and I got the four course meal with wine tasting. The food was impeccable, and the matching wines made it more perfect than it already was. My favorite dish was the tilapia appetizer. It was cooked in a banana leaf with this amazing green sauce. I was craving more after that.I had no complaints, and I am going to add this to my favorite restaurant list., Ive been here once and oh my goodness the food is great. Since Im going back again on Friday I was going to wait to post until afterwards...but then I started thinking about the Palak Chaat (crispy spinach) with sweet yogurt, tamarind, and date chutney and I had to write about it or Id run over there now! This food was really close to perfect. It made me silent...because I wanted to focus on the taste. I dont really remember the ambience of the space other than it was nice...I quickly ignored everything other than the food once it came out. Why isnt Friday here yet?!, Not much more to add that hasnt already been said, but just have to say... Get in there! Wow! Holy Moly! OMG! Holy Cow this place is Yummalicious!.....Did I mention that I liked it?, You know, I didnt understand all the hype the first time I went. I had a few issues with the place even though the food was AWESOME. The chefs table area was dusty and the service was mediocre. I emailed the place and they encouraged me back. Needless to say, the second visit was great. The food was still awesome and inventive. Ive done the tasting menu twice and really enjoyed their offerings. They even let me switch the dessert (I hate jelabi) which was really nice of them. To note, the chicken is white meat, not dark meat like in traditional dishes. I think this is an American thing. Oh and the drinks are really original and refreshing., My favorite Indian restaurant in D.C., bar none. Im almost hesitant to write this review, because Im worried it will promote it, and thus make it busier, and harder to get a reservation at. Great service, and food thats spicy, if you want it, but still palatable for those who are not used to eating Indian food. I take my parents here, every time they come to town. And were Indian...I guess that says a lot., my bologna has a first name, its r-a-s-i-k-a  ...visiting my folks in DC got me to this place, but we drove away kind of underwhelmed; while we agreed it was solid food, e.g. the naan is burnt in all the right ways, & the vegetables have the right amount of bite to them, the big question we came away with was:this restaurant is highest rated indian food in the DC area, isn logical to ask why doesn it challenge us more on the notion of typical indian fare? i.e. shouldn the leader among the indian food genre be pushing the envelope as much as new york, london or singapore - the chocolate samosa is the item that stood out as something that may be boundary food, but I think there is some reservation with the daring level of the menu, and much more reservation with the preparation.unimpressive:- dahl makhani- mint paratha - calamari chili garlic (although tender, lacks in subtlety)- fish caldine (fried red snapper)- basmati rice (really, we had to send back the first one for undercooking!)good:- their website design (though heavyweight)- free delivery (moot: I don live around here, but I imagine its a good thing)- chix tikka (yes, squeeze that lemon on)bad:- writing this here review after being there only once. usually I give a place 3 times before being a critic, so it is feasible this opinion may go north- reading other reviews makes me feel like an outsider yelling this king has no clothes -- washingtonites: raise your bar! it must get better than this., Call me crazy or a psycho, but I wasnt wowed by this place. Ill preface this by saying I havent had too much Indian food, but spice and seasoned food does not bother me, I actually really like it.For the food I would rate it a 3.5. I had the sea bass and it was quite tasty but I wasnt a little more flavor. I felt like it was missing something. Thanks to everyones reviews, I tried the Palak Chaat. It has such a unique tecture and very good. You really cant explain it without tasting it. We also shared the mango shrimp appetizer. According to our server this was a signature starter. I dont know why because it was nothing special. I think its signature because its the most expensive starter on the menu (just like the signature sea bass for an entree). We also got a side of cauliflower and peas. I did not like this. Ive had this many times at other places and this one was swimming in lots of oil and way too spicy with few pieces of cauliflower. I actually asked for this mild and made with very little oil. They obviously didnt hear me over the blasting A/C.Overall my dining parter and I didnt have that great of an experience. We were seated under an A/C vent and it was FREEZING in there. We even switched tables and ended up in the worst location in the house, behind a pole. This led to not ever being able to flag down our server. However, we were unsure who our server was. Each time somebody took our order, delivered our food, filled the water, checked up on us (only once), it was a different person. We were confused all night.I didnt find the prices to be too outrageous here, if you order correctly. Its definitely more of a splurge than your typical Indian restaurant, and its very pretty inside, but I dont think Ill be rushing back there anytime soon. Id much rather check out another Penn Quarter establishment or even hit up another place in their restaurant group., Overall, the food was good, the drinks were okay, the seating was poor. The waitress was attentiive but not overbearing. I had the pomegrante margarita, which if you closed your eyes could be confused with a normal lime margarita. My friend had the mango cosmopolitan which was an unusual, but tasty combination of flavors. The tilapia and chicken tikka appetizers were great and worth the money. The chicken with saffron rice was a good entree. The waitress said the fish manga had a little bit of a kick, and she wasnt kidding! But at the end of the night, the inconvenient seating was bothering me all night - despite the restaurant being empty we were seated where one chair was by a random and awkwardly placed pillar and an ice bucket that had to be moved in order to pull the seat back.. I have no idea why they set up the restaurant to have these tables near the pillars and why they seated us there when the restaurant was virtually empty. We went in with the intention of ordering the pre-thater menu ($28 three courses), but the choices were limited and overall unappealing. We decided to scrap it and order individual items., I think we went to Rasika on one of those special occasions (birthday, anniversary...cant remember which - dont tell my husband) and really enjoyed the food. They also make some good, smooth drinks at the bar. My only recommendation is to skip the dessert - Ive got a real sweet tooth and the Indian/Rasika version of dessert just didnt do it for me. Perhaps we made the mistake of getting what amounted to be a heap of carrot pieces soaked in coconut milk - that, my friend, does not qualify for a dessert., Very clean and elegant. Great food. The naans were soft and rich in taste. The Lamb Roganjosh was delicious and not too spicy. Though most aspects of this restaurant are commendable, the service was horrible. We were promised seating several times, while several people who showed up after us were seated before us. Also, it seemed as if every table but ours was served while we waited for about 45 minutes for our food. Let us not forget the two teas we ordered. Well, we didnt forget, but our waiter sure did. Despite all the negatives, Im going to assume this wasnt the norm. I still give them 4 stars. Ill avoid eating here again so that Ill stand uncorrected., what a great find. friend was in town from NYC so we walked over from Hotel George(not the nicest of walks btw, reminded me of, well, NYC).Walking in without reservations, seating for table on a monday around 8pm took us to 45min but seating in the bar area at the low tables was immediate - score..and service was excellent and prompteverything is a la cart, but the Garlic Naan was damn tasty , though its $3 per two pieces. ouch. Do they import from India?Tandoori Chicken - very tasty, 6 pieces. but who is counting? Lamb Roganjosh, very good, too spicy for my friend though I found it quite mild. Lots of sauce to share.From the Vegetarian section we tried the Palak Makki side, mixture of baby corn, spinach and ginger, it was really good, really good!At the end I felt I wasnt full so thought I would have to eat more when I got home. wrong. You know how youre suppose to stop eating 20min before you get full, it was perfect this time. Not hungry afterwards, and not overly stuffed. My stomach thanks you Rasika.Would definitely return, and note they have pre theater fixed price faire for those headed to Wooly Mammoth next door., really good, I ate here during restaurant week in January. Was very excited because I heard good things and had not really found an Indian restaurant I liked in DC yet. Rasika was great. I loved the Palak Chaat (crispy spinach)! Couldnt get enough of it. Would definitely go back., I went here the other night for a special event. Had heard much about the place, but it did not meet my expectations for a top Indian restaurant. The offerings are far from traditional, some of the innovations here work great and others fail to impress. Overall, good but quite expensive unless you know what to order.Spinach (palak) chaat appetizer was excellent, ground lamb kabab, mushy and not recommended. Tandoori salmon was tasty- nice cut of fish; duck breast not a good choice - overpowered by the spicy sauce. The breads were very expensive at $3-4 dollars each or $8 for basket of three. Quality of naan was okay but a bit undercooked and not as piping hot as should be. Raita (yogurt salad) was very good.I was surprised (annoyed) that you have to pay for plain Basmati rice and condiments (pickles) in this restaurant. The pickles may be special, but such items are fundamental to an Indian meal and should not be priced as add-ons.Desserts were good, especially sorbet. My date was turned off by the cilantro flavored sorbet but I liked it. The apple jalebi with cardamom ice cream was less exciting than friends had described, - ice cream part was excellent.The ambiance of Rasika is very lively, on the noisy side. It is hard to have a conversation here. I recommend it for drinks and appetizers, but doesn quite make it for an elegant dinner, especially given the quality of service. Our waitress hardly checked back with us., except to empty our beer bottles into our glasses ASAP. I would go back with someone who had tried out several of the dishes because some are much better than others., Come for the fried spinach and the Spicy Queen Mango Martini (or something like that). The other food was really tasty too. My friend swears by the butter chicken and I tried 2 small plates - the calamari and the seekh kebab. Both were yummy and had a nice kick to them.Its not cheap, but it tastes good, and our server was great!, Two words for you. Palak Chaat. That crispy spinich was something special.We told the waitress thatt we were from out of town and wanted to try as much as we could. She recommended 4 curries of which she would give the two of us a half order of each. So she charged us for 2 curries and we got to try 4. That plus the bread basket (3 types of bread) and we were good to go. I will definately be back the next time Im in DC. Our second favorite restaurant in DC., one of the best dining experiences of my life. i get to travel to dc about once a month, so it was great to have one night of pure bliss last time i was in town.believe the hype: the palak chaat is unreal. it truly is unlike any other flavor or texture ive ever experienced (maybe its cuz im white).everything else we had was cooked to perfection also. the combinations of flavors and smells were truly original. and the cheapest bottle of wine on the menu turned out to be one of my favorite bottles ive ever tasted. dont remember what it was, but i recall it was from south africa.go to this place. spend the cash. believe me you wont be disappointed., If, like me, you grew up in a fairly homogeneous culinary society (me Italian), then eating at a place like Rasika is the equivalent of being released from an all-boy Catholic school and realizing there are women who look very different than the nuns who beat you all the time with wooden spoons!Ie never heard of Palak Chaat, but the thought of paying $10 for a pile of fried spinach immediately sent shivers straight from eyes reading it on the menu to my wallet, stored securely in the confines of my tight back pocket.But given my proclivity towards trying all things unknown to my sheltered upbringing, I decided to take the plunge and see what all the fuss was about. All I can say after the experience is ...How does one say may I have another, please in Indian?The taste, texture, and smell of this delicate appetizer was nothing short of revolutionary in my mind. How could something as pedestrian as spinach be manipulated into perhaps the most appetizing morsel known to mankind? I don know, for sure, how the slick chefs at Rasika did it, but the experience keeps me coming back for another helping.In true Italian form, Bravo! Bravo!4 stars for quality, service & ambiance, but a little pricey IMHO., Dear Parents of Toddlers:You are not welcome in public eateries as nice as Rasika. Until you get a handle on your screaming idiot offspring, keep them home. This means NO PLANES, NO (adult) RESTAURANTS, NO THEATERS. Assholes. Who brings a 2 year old to a nice restaurant in downtown D.C. until 10pm? Jerks. Minus one star for Rasika not asking them to leave immediately. I guess D.C. doesnt have a Department of Common Decency. I digress.The food, service, and atmosphere (sans the screaming baby) were uncanny. We had... Well, theres no way Ill remember it all. I think there was sea bass, a curried chicken dish, a mixed this that and the other thing platter, etc. Every dish was out of this world. Bold, spicy flavor was the cornerstone of every dish. Additionally, the price is very reasonable for what you get.Seriously, it was very close to the elusive five star experience. You see, there was this baby..., Well, of course I felt at ease here. Clean lines, blond wood. Plus, their tilapia with mint, cilantro and coconut was amazing., Great food, great atmosphere, very expensive. Definitely a special occasions type of restaurant. The food is delicious, and the wine menu is satisfying. The waiters are either very helpful or a little on the snooty side depending upon your point of view; if a waiter with an opinionated sense of what to recommend puts you off, then you might not want to go here. Ie had laissez-faire waiters here as well as the aforementioned variety; either way, I still loved the experience and go here to be treated!, Rasika always seems to be near the top of every list of Washingtons best dining destinations. Frankly, that it was Indian cuisine sort of intimidated me. Nice places are usually expensive, and thats ok with me. But Im hesitant to go to a nice, expensive place when I have little to no idea what Im ordering. Now, the menu does have simple descriptions of each selection, including ingredients. But given my general unfamiliarity with most Indian cuisine, spending the money on such an unknown experience gave me pause.So, we did what any good culturally-unaware couple would do: we brought along our Indian friends. Turns out my hesitation to try Rasika before was unwarranted. Our group ordered a number of entrees and appetizers which we all shared so we could taste as many of the tempting alternatives on the menu as possible. The service was helpful, but there were some long pauses between appearances of our server at the table. The decor is contemporary and sets just the right exotic and sophisticated mood. Our Indian friends concurred that this was indeed very high quality Indian cuisine and compared it favorably (although not quite as good) to what their families make at home. Id definitely return., Similar to some of the other entries, a couple of friends and I took another friend who had never eaten Indian food before. Thinking back, I feel bad taking him here because, chances are, hell never find Indian food as incredibly delicious as the offerings at Rasika. Absolute musts: Gin and Tonic: yes, its classic, but the ice cubes are made from tonic and lime juice. Definitely one of the best G&Ts Ive ever had.  Palak Chaat: spinach + date chutney = absolutely scrumptious  Lamb Roganjosh: the lamb was so tender and went really well with the caramelized onions.  Gobhi Mattar: I dont really like cauliflower, but the blend of ginger and cumin made me a believer.  Anything on the menu: all of the dishes we ordered were fantastic. The server was very helpful in selecting appropriate dishes and a wine to match. They were a little lacking on following up as the meal went on, but I was too busy enjoying my meal to even notice until the end. Be warned: A little bit on the pricey side, but definitely worth every bit. Im definitely going back next time Im in DC., Rasika is a much appreciated addition to the culinary alley in Penn Quarter. I visited Rasika first 4 years ago for restaurant week and was delighted with their updated twists on traditional Indian cuisine. The restaurant menu didnt skimp on anything and I didnt leave feeling like the food I had been served paled in comparision to their regular menu. The papadum was crisp, the curries flavorful and with a zing, the dal, paneer, and other treats all hit just the right notes. I loved their playful take on a samosa and have been back many times when I want something a little out of the ordinary!, I loved Rasika. It really is a fun, unique twist on Indian. I definitely need to go back soon and try more dishes., Probably more like 4.25. Not really much more to add that hasn already been said here. Had the 4 course Palaak Chaat was excellent. Wife loved the tilapia wrapped in banana leaf and the apple beignet dessert. Service was friendly but a tad spotty. Nothing to complain about though. A lot of food for the price. My wife and I probably could have split 1 chef tasting menu and been okay., Rasika is the perfect place youd take your first date to if youre trying to impress her...I was impressed :) I would also recommend it for special occasions. You could be dressed to the nines and not feel out of place. The food was scrumptious, but the portions are small. I love the decor and lighting...very contemporary. The presentation of the food was like art work. I had reservations, but my table wasnt ready...ended up waiting at the bar for 45 minutes...bartender was attentive and generous with rum in my mojito...the manager ended apologizing for the long wait and gave us a complimentary Crispy Spinach appetizer, although several yelpers love the Crispy Spinach, I felt it was a little too bland compared with other items on the menu.I had the masala crab cakes, lamb roganjosh, black cod with dill, garlic naan, and calamari for an appetizer. I really liked the lamb roganjosh, the size of the lamb portion was like the size of a kiwi...wish the portions were larger. I could taste the seasoning and spices in every bite of lamb roganjosh and black cod...mmm yummy SERVICE: ExcellentFOOD PRESENTATION: Nice and SimpleFOOD: DeliciousDECOR: Sleek and SexyAMBIANCE: Hip and TrendyI usually dont rate many restaurants 5 stars, but Rasika definitely deserves this 5 star rating. Overall the restaurant is outstanding :) I look forward to going back soon., Was visiting friends in DC and tried this place for the first time. OUTSTANDING! Great place to take n00bs just trying Indian for the first time. Waiter had some excellent signature dish recommendations. Fried spinach is a must. Hope you like awesome!, outstanding service, excellent (if pricey) food. relaxed, elegant atmosphere. and it was a good sign to see many south asian families dining there.palak chaat appetizer is fantastic! as are the topped biscuits. butter chicken and lamb pisto korma both tasty. apple beignet is not to be missed., The Short and Sweet: great food, great service, yummy drinks, relaxing ambiance.The Long and Involved: Ive eaten at Rasika twice and I have luxuriated in the fusion of spice and the freshest of ingredients that combined make this some of the best Indian food Ive ever had (and I eat quite a bit). Each time, the service was impeccable. I was fortunate both times to be dining in small groups with big hearted individuals, so we shared, and shared, and shared some more. There isnt anything on this menu I cant heartily recommend, including the breads and sauces. The first time I would have given it 5 stars...but the second time there was a screaming baby dining in our vicinity at 10 oclock at night...which as most people (including the most patient of parents) will tell you, does not create an ambiance for a luxurious dining experience. So...demoted to 4 1/2 stars., My current favorite Indian restaurant in the DC area. I usually don like places that are into fusion but they don go over the top. Everything I had meat and veg have been awesome. I usually eat the mixed grill (tandoori salmon, chicken tikka, and seekh kabob) - its great. Cool looking restaurant and bar, and although its nice and fancy I don get that stuffy vibe that other Penn Quarter places have., Rasika was recommended to us by EmCee Cho, food Master of DC. He wasn wrong. We made a reservation for a Friday lunch, and it a good thing we did so. There were no walk-ins being taken for the two hours we were there. The host sat us at a great round table/booth for four in the front window near the entrance. People-watching Nirvana! The place is very sophisticated-looking, from the beautifully-tiled floors to the interesting felt wallcoverings to the flowing, jewel-colored silk curtains dividing the rooms. This restaurant probably seats two hundred. We had lunch with two friends who have only had Indian food at my place, and loved it, so they were open to trying anything I forced them to try. Which was a lot. We shared everything, and started with Asparagus Uttapam, rice lentil cakes with fresh asparagus, curry leaves and coconut chutney. Fantastic. They served pappadums and mint chutney for the table. We proceeded to Tawa Baigan (eggplant, potato, peanut sauce), cucumber raita, lemon cashew rice, naan and roti, Bhindi Amchoor (crisp okra slices tossed with mango powder), tandoori chicken (very moist and perfectly cooked...sometimes this dish can be dry), Palak Chaat (crisp spinach leaves tossed with sweet yogurt, tamarind, and date chutney: Shazam! As Gomer would say.) Chaat translates as to lick and boy oh boy were we licking this chaat. We also got a plate of Gobhi Mattar (cauliflower, peas, cumin and ginger). All the vegetable dishes can be ordered as sides or mains. We got sides so we could try more flavors, and we were very glad we did. The music was beautiful, the service was expert and smooth, the dishes, flatware and glassware were very high quality, beautifully designed and spotless, the rest rooms were dreamy and very clean. A great feature that I don think Ie ever seen before is that each ladiesroom stall had a large mirror in it so you can check to see if your skirt hem is tucked into your waistband. No more embarrassment! Although youl have to check for the toilet paper stuck to your shoe yourself. Rasika is the very best Indian restaurant wee ever had the pleasure of eating in. Highly and enthusiastically recommended. The parking garage directly across the street comes in handy., So many good reviews of Rasika, but I have to offer my two cents. I usually get the little tables at the bar area b/c we never make reservations But last night we got a nice table near the window and had an amazing dinner. I forgot how good Rasika is! The food is so flavorful and the spices to die for - we had some very spicy dishes! The paneer tawa masala was the spiciest of our shared dishes, but soooo tasty and the chicken green masala had the best combination of spices and lovely mint/coriander Ive ever had - there was a slight tang to it too! They have a remarkable way of bringing out the flavors from the herbs and spices, you can really smell it when you eat - or walk in. Also, my friend had a cucumber basil cocktail - so fresh, you could actually taste and smell real cucumber and basil - amazing!Our palak chaat was a little too salty this time, but it was still good. Stylish yet classy decor, comfortable space. Service was great, stealthy kind where you never have to look for the waiter b/c your glass of water is constantly filled - and you will need water;), I went over there last week with few of my buddies. I agree the food are great, but the service need to be improve. The waitress dont seem to remember a lot of order and never wrote down on the paper. The bread came out before the main entree. I know it was the rush hour, but service is part of the package and represent the restaurant, too. The spricy cooktail (forgot the name) is very nice.Overall it is a OK experience, and little overprice and overrate., DC insider tip: go on a Monday *not* at 7pm. (6:30 is okay; 8pm is okay for immediate seating in the bar area.) Sit in the bar area; no reservation required. You can be seated right away, with this strategy. Otherwise, make reservations or prepare for a long wait.Rasika ranking as #41 in Washingtonian Magazine top 100 restaurants is well-deserved.Last night, I had a mix of Restaurant Week plates as well as traditional offerings.Appetizers:- Crispy spinach was totally delicious! It was neither salty nor greasy, and the flavor was mild.- The Spiced Potato and chick peas were wonderful. The dish also had tamarind and dates in it, imparting complexity and unexpected goodness.- I also ordered the Seekh Kabob of minced lamb. It was delicious.- I also got the Garlic Naan with Herbs. It was delicious. They brought out mint Naan, and plan. All were good.- I ordered a chutney with ginger in it that was dark in color. It was wonderful.Entrees:- The mixed grill of salmon, chicken and seekh kabob was good. The flavor was good, but it wasn my favorite thing all night. The salmon was almost overcooked.- The Lamb curry in coconut milk was probably the best thing I had there. It was dark, smoky and spicy. The flavor was so good, I can describe it!- I also ordered the Vegetarian Dal Makhnai - spiced lentils. They were worth every penny of the $5 I paid for the small portion - that was enough for 3 people to share. Lentils were tender, in a rich, complex sauce perfect for rice or naan.Desserts:- The mango/ saffron sorbet was good.- The Gulab Jamun (carrot cake) with cardamom ice cream was the rival of the best thing Ie eaten in a long, long time. I AM CRAZY ABOUT THE CARDAMOM ICE CREAM!!!! It was incredible - with intense cardamom flavor and a texture of real spices in it. WOW. WOW! My fave ice creams of all time are:- Bittersweet, by Thomas Sweet Creamery (Georgetown, DC);- Mexican Vanilla, by Amy Ice Cream, Texas- Cardamom ice cream at RasikaIe had drinks here before as well, and if you like artistic, complex cocktails with unusual ingredients, Rasika the place.Service was excellent. I actually found Rasika to be pretty affordable. The naan was $3; appetizers were $8 hearty portions; and the lentils were only $5. The smaller portions were enough food, even with several people sharing. I think I paid about $25 for a moderate-sized meal.Rasika may be my favorite restaurant in DC. I highly recommend., Wish I had gone for restaurant week--damn this was an expensive Indian place. Kinda sucks that entire genres of foods have a this should not be expensive feel about them--Indian food and Thai food-- just a couple examples. My husband, and our BFF brought me here for my birthday, I had the vegetarian tasting menu, and they had the regular tasting menus. I suggest taking a look at the drink menu, I had something peachy with a little spice--very yummy! Food was so crazy good I had to stop eating--literally was almost in pain I ate too much. Same report from the boys, great food, good service--I highly recommend it! You really do get what you pay for!!!, Went here with a couple of friends on my birthday and did the Tasting menu (vegetarian & non-veg).Each course that was brought to the the table still retained its original flavor but had an added twist to it.The ambience was great, as was the service. It all came together very well & made for a very memorable meal on a special day.The bar area looked very inviting & I would definitely like to go back and try it out., I really really like Rasika. I am extremely picky and am fairly new to the joys of Indian food but Rasika really wowed me. Arrived at the heart of the Friday dinner rush with no reservation thinking that I was special. Guess what I am special! The manager was absolutely wonderful managed to find us a seat in the bar/lounge area after about 15 mins. The bar was about 3 deep with folks waiting for a table and the small foyer area was packed with people who also thought they were special (read: no reservations). The food was divine. The only thing is forget about have a conversation in this place. It is as loud as it is beautiful. Talk to your dining companion while driving around looking for parking cause you will not hear each other when you get inside. Funny story: My friend and I were just screaming across the table to each other about how loud it was in there when one of the Washington Post City Guide reporters came over to take photos of our food and measure the noise level for a story they were doing on Noisy Restaurants - Talk About Timing!! Pack your Sound Reduction Earphones and Enjoy Your Meal!, I went to Rasika with a group of people and we ordered a bunch of dishes -- all of which were *delicious* Palak Chaat is a must-order! Love the decor and service was good.
59|roses-luxury-washington|Creative brilliant DELICIOUS fun all wrapped up inside a beautiful jewel box. And believe me this is no ordinary jewel box! When you first walk in you dont know what to look at first because this restaurant has it all; to the eclectic furnishing to the beautiful woods and tile floors I felt like I was wrapped up tightly into a cocoon and would never want to come out. Every nook and cranny is filled with such passion for the love of art and food. And speaking of food where do I start? Well to begin with you must have the lychee salad and the popcorn soup with lobster and then order everything else! Your palette will be taken on an amazing journey of cultures . You cant miss with anything you order. I cant finish without mentioning the staff; beautiful charming helpful and happy.. And it all starts with the owner and chef cool Aaron Silverman. This tattooed handsome guy really knows the restaurant business through and through. Did I mention before that he knows how to cook??? My mouth is watering just thinking about his food! I cant wait to go back to eat and to hang out in this magical restaurant., Great mea! The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. The d39cor alone is a reason to visit Roses. It has a trendy, vintage feel and the personal touches dont go unnoticed. As for the food--it was fabulous. We ordered a number of small plates all of which were great, but three dishes are a must have! The pork sausage and lychee salad, spaghetti with strawberry and ricotta and the popcorn soup with grilled lobster. These are unique and delicious dishes you truly cant get anywhere else. Ok, 2 more things worth mentioning, the potato bread they bring out to start is a perfect way to start the meal and you have to try the peach baby back ribs (so tender!). If you havent tried Roses yet, its definitely worth the trip!, Went to visit Roses Luxury, as theyve just opened this week. The decor and style are a perfect use of the space. Clean and simple, the exposed brick gives the place character. The upstairs bar is a gorgeous setting for a drink, and with the promise of an outdoor patio to come, would be a great place for a drink after work or romantic date.Where do I begin with the food?! With the majority of the offerings being smaller plates, we were able to try over half the menu! We started off with the popcorn soup with butter poached lobster! It tastes exactly like rich, buttered popcorn with the added benefit of sweet, tender lobster. The roasted peach ribs were phenomenal as well. Caramelize cauliflower was plated with some Greek yogurt, golden raisin puree and bread crumbs for texture. Great balance of flavor. Even ordinary Romaine lettuce was prepared beautifully as half a head was charred, then topped with avocado and cotija, laid on salsa verde. Our table shared the beef brisket, which was piled high, and cooked to perfection. Its served with toasted white bread, horseradish and cilantro cole slaw. Finally, dessert was offered in two forms: homemade vanilla ice cream with extra virgin olive oil, sea salt and toasted bread crumbs. Not a combination I would have thought of, but again it didnt disappoint, and I could have had another serving. The other dessert was a foie gras french toast with cinnamon toast crunch ice cream. Again, not something that I would have thought to put together, but it worked beautifully.They also had a list of handcrafted cocktails and craft beers they offer.The service was top-notch. Everyone was incredibly attentive and knew everything about the menu, including why some of the flavor combinations had been chosen.Chef Aaron Silverman and team have done an excellent job in combining great service with a beautiful environment, and anchoring it, of course, with great food! Hurry up and go before anyone else finds out about Roses and it becomes impossible to get into!, A small group of us went here over the weekend to grab some food before we went out for drinks. It was great. The atmosphere was amazing and I loved that you could look over and see them preparing your food. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and went out of his way to make sure we loved our food / drinks. OMG. The food. The popcorn soup was crazy good. The chunks of lobster were out of this world. The two biggest hits for our table were the oysters (omg) and the beef brisket. The beef brisket was so moist and the slaw that comes with it was just as tasty. So I could go on and on. Our visit to this place was an A+. I definitely recommend stopping by Roses if you are in the Capitol Hill area. You will not leave disappointed or hungry :)Oh, I almost forgot to mention the little loaf of bread they give you before your food comes...Holy Moly..., Roses Luxury is charming with a good atmosphere and excellent service, however, we left somewhat disappointed and hungry. The popcorn soup was overly salty, the gnocci was just okay (definitely not worth $13 for I believe 3 gnocci). I really enjoyed the grilled octopus which was cooked perfectly and served with a nice puree. My date & I both enjoyed the crispy cauliflower and potato bread. We really wanted to love the food but for a menu that has a few options we expected to be wowed or at least meet the quality of other restaurants with the same price point, but perhaps our expectations were too high for opening wkend. I see a lot of potential in this place and hope they continue to improve., Go try this place before everyone else finds it it, while walk-in tables are still easy to come by. Two of us grabbed a spontaneous meal here last night and were blown away - we cant wait to come back.We started off with nicely balanced whiskey-jalape31o cocktails and the complimentary potato bread with sour cream and bacon. I thought Id had great potato bread before - I was wrong. This is the stuff of legend. Next up was pork and lychee salad, which was a flavor bomb and again, perfectly balanced - sweet, spicy, acidic, and totally addictive.Based on the rave reviews, we also tried the popcorn soup, which was a stunner. The lobster chunks were so perfectly cooked that they had me rethinking most of the restaurant lobster Ive had recently. If youve fallen victim to a tough hunk of shellfish in an overhyped mac and cheese, come taste this and fall in love with lobster again. We also loved the fennel gnocchi (fresh, light-tasting, clean) and the cauliflower (order it, even if you dont normally like it - deep frying makes everything better). Eggplant with honey was so decadent and addictive I nearly licked the plate - Id come back for this dish alone. Only two desserts are on offer right now, but who cares when one of them is foie gras french toast? Lets just say its as good as it sounds and perfectly executed.Service more than measured up - our waitress was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. She also let us know that they can modify some dishes for vegetarians, vegans, and people with gluten allergies, which is great news, since Im already planning a return trip with others. When a brand-new restaurant with a small, eclectic menu manages to hit this many dishes out of the park, its only a matter of time until the rest of the city catches on. Youll be glad you beat the rush., I have wanted this place in the neighborhood for a while, I had hope teds would fit the bill but was disappointed. Roses was exactly what we hoped for, the fried chicken was amazing, the potato bread was great, and the cauliflower was delicious. Now let me mention the French toast battered in cinnamon toast crunch ice cream base topped with foie gras - are you kidding? - no, get it! Roses is in Capitol Hill and its about time!!, Was heading to a wine class at Decanter tonight when I saw this place out of the corner of my eye. Its small but not hard to miss with the big green neon sign. I took a peek in the window, thought it looked like a place to check out, and then headed on to the class.At the end of the class, I suggested the place as an alternative to Teds (since it was new to us). We walked down and looked at the small menu on the window. I was surprised at how short it was. Dont let that deter you...the food is phenomenal.My wife and I had the popcorn soup, the pear baby back ribs, the strawberry pasta, the brisket, and the vanilla ice cream with olive oil and sea salt. Everything was great. The popcorn soup may have been the most innovative thing I have ever eaten. To the review that called it too salty, you must have gotten the off batch, because this was freaking amazing! The ribs were also quite good with a citrus spice kick at the end (not overly spicy if you worry about that kind of thing). However, the strawberry pasta was the dish of the night. Remarkable in that it was both different and altogether comforting, it was one of the best things I have eaten in DC. It is a must try on your visit.The brisket is family style (as opposed to the small plates for the other dishes). It was a perfect portion to split if you get a couple of small plates. My wife and I brought some home after three small plates and wanting to save room for the ice cream but with a little less food (keeping in mind the soup is very thick) the brisket would easily split between two. The brisket was great - lean and tender while still flavorful and lightly charred. Brisket is often very difficult, but they knocked it out of the park.The ice cream was pleasantly simply. It was good ice cream (seemed house made) in a small pool of olive oil (which seemed small batch - I wonder if they went to Sapore for it) with sea salt and brioche sprinkled on top. It was refreshing with a nice crunch. The food was great and we had excellent service all night long. The price is a little high but with food this good (and obviously high quality) in a neighborhood like Barracks Row, you cant expect much less. Plus, we ended up bringing food home, which means we could have probably saved somewhere on our bill.Overall, this is maybe the best restaurant I have eaten at in DC. It is certainly my new favorite in Barracks Row! Go as soon as you can and go often...just save me a seat!!, Im one of those people who keep saying they are going to start posting reviews on Yelp....but never actually do. Tonights restaurant experience has inspired me to finally pop my precious Yelp cherry. Roses Luxury is one of only two restaurants in the District of Columbia to blow me away (the only other being Little Serow) and Ive definitely played the restaurant field in the three years Ive lived here. Many of them left me with a vague sense of disappointment, wishing Id just grabbed Chipotle instead. But this place had me wishing everyone would look away so I could lick every last drop of heaven off of each and every plate we ordered. For the record we had:- sausage/lychee/habanero salad (amazing flavors, echoes of Little Serow)- popcorn/lobster soup (deliciously decadent)- strawberry pasta (wasnt sure about this going in, but it was amazing)- ribs (very good, and Im a BBQ nut)- vanilla ice cream with sea salt and olive oil (a fitting climax of sweet and savory goodness)Not to mention the fact that the service was great, the d39cor and ambiance were spot on, and they have an excellent beer list. This place is going to be a big hit, and a very welcome addition to The Hill. I know they say theres nothing like your first time, but by dessert I was already looking forward to my second date with Roses Luxury. Shes a keeper., What most excites me about a restaurant is when a dish provides you with a taste that is completely unique and new to your palete. Thats precisely the experience I had at Roses Luxury in trying their incredible lychee, pork sausage and habanero salad which also has peanuts and a coconut foam. Stir this whole thing together - and while it wont look terribly attractive - it will taste like nothing youve ever had before. Roses take on Banh Mi is also not to be missed. Among the family style plates, we ordered the brisket which was way too much for two people but was tender and delicious. Even the fresh potato bread was a tour de force. On top of all this, the service was excellent and the space is beautifully designed. Dont miss this place!, Capitol Hill is often overlooked when it comes to DC dining but with Ambar and now, especially, Rose Luxury that will be harder to do. Rose does inventive cooking exceptionally well and has a great space to work in. Wifey, a friend, and I stopped in at 6:45 on a Saturday and there was an hour wait. We been expecting this so it wasn a big deal and we were in fact seated right around 7:50 or so.We were greeted immediately upon being seated but in general the service was helter-skelter. This place is so new, though, that I not sure if our server was inexperienced, if the restaurant was still dealing with being super popular all of a sudden, or what. But the staff did realize things were a bit off and they twice gave us a dish for free for our trouble (without our complaining first, I should add).The first dish we got was the oysters with dark & stormy granita. The granita just tasted like ginger ice chips to me, but it was a delicious combination. The potato bread was just as good as advertised - warm and soft and, in our case, gone in 60 seconds.We got a number of small plates. We had the pork sausage, habanero, and lychee salad, which was a highlight. In case youe scared by the habanero, it actually was not that spicy at all, although in a few bites you could taste a bit of the pepper. The strawberry pasta is strange (like a few things here) but really good. There is no mistaking the strawberry flavor so don order this unless you love it. Likewise the popcorn soup with lobster has a very strong popcorn and movie butter flavor. I actually really enjoyed the soup but the dish would be best split among 4 or more people. After a few bites the taste became cloying and was too much - but those first few bites were almost life changing. The octopus tasted very fresh and I almost started licking the squid ink infused with lemon off the plate.We also had the brisket, which was on the family style portion of the menu and was considerably larger. You get much more value for the family style dishes than the small plates. Anyway the brisket was tender and they serve it with pieces of toast, slaw and horseradish so you can make your own open-faced sandwiches.Our server sold us on the foie gras dessert with cinnamon ice cream and brioche. The combination worked really well and they serve a lot of foie gras with it. But at $15 it probably not worth it. As good as everything is, in fact, the price point is a bit high for how small the plates are. That, more than the wait or anything else, is what would keep me from coming back soon., Delicious, unique and innovative food. A real gem for DC. Try the small plate with lychees in it. Amazing. The brisket was cooked through, but what amazed me was the melt in your mouth fatty part. A foodies dream., Rose Luxury rivals the Inn for a quarter of the price. Yes, THAT Inn. Simply saying the food is outstanding doesn do this adorable little restaurant justice. My husband and I seriously said wow after every first bite of *every* course. The popcorn soup is bonkers. I had foie gras for freaking desert. And the drinks! Holy crap, the drinks! We ordered 6 between the two of us and each one was better than the last. Regardless of the liquor used, I loved the cocktails. I don particularly care for whiskey, for example, but the drinks are mixed so well, that didn matter. The octopus with squid ink was unreal. They have this amazing sweet chicken served with hot sauce that will stop you in your tracks. All the food--ALL of it--is inspired, memorable, creative, and most of all, delicious. There are no reservations; tables are first come, first serve. Get to Rose Luxury while most of DC doesn know it exists, because it going to blow up fast., simply AMAZING beautiful Restaurant, great food and wonderful service, I almost decided not to write a review for this place because I didnt want other people to find our new neighborhood gem but then I thought I had to give credit to the chef.The food is one of a kind: delicious and very different from anything else at the same time.My husband and I shared dishes, so here is a short list of our wows:1. Corn soup -- a must-try; my husband loved it, I liked it a lot although I think it would be better if it were a bit hotter.2. Pork ribs -- I havent tried this one, my husband liked it but said he wouldnt order it again -- in his opinion, all other food is so sophisticated and interesting that fat pork ribs are a bit out of place taste wise. 3. Duck pate -- OMG! Simply beautiful.4. Roasted cauliflower with yogurt -- really great dish.5. Strawberry spaghetti -- my personal favorite of the night although I almost always dislike any pasta I try. 6. Ice cream with olive oil -- so weird and so good!7. Almost forgot -- their homemade potato bread is divine. Conclusion: another real gem on Capitol Hill (oh my, I am so proud of my neighborhood!)., Excellent resto... even worth the schlep up to Capitol Hill. We read Tom Sietsemas review and also love some of the restaurants where the head chef has worked like Uchi in Austin and Momofuku, so we headed over for dinner last night. Great decor (sort of mod Southern kitsch), but the food was the standout. The cauliflower is an absolute must -- and have you ever heard of absolute must cauliflower? The brisket was tender and nicely accompanied by a horseradish cr38me fraiche, and I loved the caccio e pepe pasta which was simple and perfectly cooked. Brined fried chicken also outstanding.Ill definitely be back. Best new restaurant in DC to my mind., An absolute gem, honestly. I havent found food this delicious and innovative anywhere else in DC, and the service is impeccable. Also, the interior is gorgeous and unpretentious.My bf and I ordered the following items: pork sausage and lychee salad (PHENOMENAL, full of unexpected flavors), popcorn soup (intensely flavorful and very heavy), peach glazed ribs (lovely, more conventional than other menu items), fried cauliflower (delicious, but probably the least exciting of what we ordered), and the strawberry pasta (AMAZING, totally weird in the best possible way). After dinner, we enjoyed drinks upstairs, where the bartender was wonderful despite being swamped with patrons.I cant wait to go back!, As someone homesick all the time for all the fun, relaxed but really top notch dining that can be found in Chicago, eating at Roses Luxury made me happy to be eating in DC for the first time. Our meal was perfect in every way - food, ambiance, and service (best service Ive ever had in DC - casual and friendly without hovering, and knowledgeable). Welcome to the neighborhood - so glad youre here!, The pickle brined fried chicken is absolutely divine. You really cant go wrong with their menu., I kind of hate myself right now.I am not a hype-r especially for trendy small plates restaurants. I do not want , nor do I try to be one of the yuppie masses that flocks to the latest and greatest trendy opening. Lets face it, I dont have enough money for that sort of thing. But it was my friends birthday and I love Eastern Market and so we decided to try Roses. We got in at 7 PM on a Monday and the wait was still 45 minutes- apparently its even worse on the weekends. We decided to wait at the bar upstairs. Upstairs is so charming - actually that makes it sound too quaint - its basically like being in a hip persons living room having drinks. I had this smoky whisky jalepeno cocktail that was quite delish and the bartender was happy to make my friend a mocktail once she gave some preferences which was very nice. The bar also has a scenic view of the dining area. Dont miss the bathrooms - even they are nicely thought out and very pretty.After a 30 minute wait we were seated downstairs. As soon as we ordered we started with a loaf of potato brioche which may have been the best complementary bread Ive had, maybe, ever? Thats a bold statement, Ill have to think about that some more. We then got the pork sausage, lychee, habanero foam dish. Some people complain about the prices of small plates places and I usually agree. This is the only small plate Ive ever had that actually made me think that I wasnt paying enough for the dish. This is the sort of dish that belongs on the menu at a place like Minibar, and at $13 rather than a $150+ tasting menu its a steal. We then got the already infamous popcorn soup. I actually didnt think it was as rich as everyone says it is. It was whipped and delish. My only complaint is I thought there would be more lobster. We finished our small dishes with the peach baby back ribs. They were flat out excellent, but not as interesting or unique as the other dishes. For dessert we got the vanilla ice cream with the grilled olive oil cake and crunchy bits of, I think, salt in a pool of olive oil? Very lovely.Overall, truly, truly excellent. I havent tried all the new places on 14th Street, but I can almost guarantee that Roses is twice as good as any of them. So go and eat. Or better yet, dont. My wait will be quicker., Amazing!!!! Great atmosphere, food, and staff! The staff actually interacts with their customers and are knowledgeable about the food and drinks. I brought my mother here to celebrate her birthday and the experience was great. Laid-back, but attentive. Some of the most odd combinations of ingredients, but yet soooo PERFECT! I will be back...even if its just for few drinks. Thanks to our waiter, Justin, for being so awesome & providing us with such great service!, Yeah, its THAT good. We were here twice in the two weeks after it opened, admittedly for the lychee salad, which might be the best thing Ive ever eaten. Both times we sat at the bar and the bartenders were both fabulous, despite being swamped. We took her recommendations on what to order and she didnt steer us wrong. Thrilled to have this in our neighborhood - its a very welcome addition - and I cant wait to see what they come up with next!, I went here for a special birthday dinner because the reviews were so astonishing. I really feel like I went to a different restaurant than all of these reviewers. Some of the food was plain old not good, the popcorn soup and the oysters, for instance, were just not tasty, others were mediocre, and some were actually pretty good, like the gnocchi and the potato puree. Regardless of how tasty or not tasty the dishes were, they were all tiny, really, really tiny. Ive never received such small portions in my life. The gnocchi, for instance, was literally three pieces of gnocchi. The burnt romaine was just a sliver of lettuce. We tried almost every dish on the menu, and I left very disappointed., Had a fantastic early dinner with my husband. We only had the small dishes, which weren too small after all. We ordered the fried chicken, the strawberry pasta and the grilled octopus. We sat at the bar and loved every second of it. Brian, the bartender/waiter was great! We received complimentary appetizer and dessert too. The meal was filling for the tummy and for all I our taste buds. I don think it is $$$ since you don need to order the family size portion to fill up. Great place, we will be back!!!, Definitely agree with others that this place meets - even exceeds - the hype. The wait was under an hour on a Saturday night, which felt like a win. We sat upstairs and enjoyed a few drinks, while we waited for our table. We were seated downstairs at the bar in the covered garden area, where Brian the bartender took excellent care of us. My husband had the popcorn soup, which he ranks among the best thing he has ever eaten. The caramelized cauliflower was fantastic - crunchy and salty and sweet. The strawberry pasta was surprisingly good - way more savory and peppery than I had expected. Then the brisket...I was not expecting all that much, but it was fantastic. Flavorful, tender, and so satisfying. The desserts looked so good that we couldnt pass it up. We shared the pear and marscapone, and Brian (the amazing bartender and server) brought us the chocolate cremieux too. Thank goodness he did because it was incredible. We left stuffed, happy and eager to come back again to try more of the menu., Our dinner here two weeks ago was outstanding. Everything was interesting and well-cooked. I love schnitzel and was not disappointed by theirs. Our server had a bit of nervous chatty energy but toned it down a bit after awhile. The atmosphere in the restaurant is really great. Relaxed, fun and much more interesting than the other restaurants on 8th Street., Unbelievable. Yes, its a bit pricey, but this is one experience not to let up. I went with a fellow yelper who lives in DC and was thought this place was a must try place, and what can I say? He was right.Let me break it down on what we ordered...It started off with drinks and well, what can I say it was pretty good. All of them were somewhat of flavors Ive never had before, but the highlight of this place was definitely the food.We ordered: 1. The Pork Sausage Lychee and Habanero Foam Salad2. Oysters3. Pomme Pur39e with Truffles *Limited Dish*4. Octopus Salad5. Popcorn Soup with Lobster-Dessert-6. Seckled Pear with Walnuts7. Fois Gras French Toast with Cinnamon Ice CreamI guess the only way I can do is to start from the top.1. The salad. Holy Crap. I dont even know how to describe it. There was a bit of salty and at the same time the sweetness from the lychee, the habanero foam wasnt really anything and from the looks of it and with it tops with onions which gives it another whole different type of flavor. To keep it simple: get it and get ready for your mind to be blown.2. Oysters. Well, it is DC right? So, I had to get oysters. The way they prepared it was pretty plain, but instead of cocktail sauce they put a ginger sauce and the water it sits on is salt water which was something new. It gave a different flavor profile but at the same time it was refreshing.3. Now this dish, was to die for. My friend and I just ate this very very slowly as I thought the Pur39e by itself was good enough. The truffles was definitely something extra that made the dish over the top and to die for. I dont know if this dish will be there, but ask for it anyways. It just melted in my mouth when I ate it and the taste profile was a party in my mouth. Just thinking about it is making my mouth salivate.4. Thinking that it was octopus I was initially thinking that it was going to be a little squishy or chewy as most people dont do octopus right. Rose definitely hits the spot with this dish as it was complete opposite. It had flavor and went well with a salad, surprisingly. That added with the sauce that they had on the dish (memorys losing me on what exactly it was) it was great. They grilled the octopus so that might have something to do with it, at first I thought they fried it a little, but I was completely wrong about that.5. Right, you must be thinking, how is this dish supposed to be good? Popcorn soup? Disgusting right? No. As I said, this restaurant is all about blowing the customers mind. This soup had popcorn kernels, as well as a good strong buttery taste that we all know and love on our popcorn. Within the soup, there were pieces of lobster which was a treat. To me this soup was pretty strong in flavor and thick. Still, a must try dish.6. On to dessert. Seckled Pear. Sweet, not extremely though and it was good. But, out of the two desserts I would definitely recommend the Fois Gras dessert.7. What the hell. Just the name of it sounds insane. Fois Gras French Toast with Cinnamon Ice Cream? How does this work? I think someone was smoking a little of you know what for coming up with this one, but it works. Fois Gras was a little salty, the French Toast sweet, and the Cinnamon Ice Cream brought it all together. It was Hot, Cold, Warm all at the same time. I truly dont know how to describe this dish as it just sort of blew my mind, it was good though. If youre into charting the unknowns and like having your mind blown, order this.Service:Great. No problems here. Restaurant was super busy however we got seated in like 30 minutes, and had great service the whole time.Ambiance/Decor:Definitely a couples type of place, but me being a foodie I didnt really care about that stuff. It can be seen as a romantic/new age/contemporary sort of ambiance. High class with a hint of rebellion is what I would describe it. Breaking rules in cooking, but still keeping it classy.Verdict:It lives up to its hype. Yes, its really a 5 star restaurant and I hope it will be one the next time I come and eat here. To just plainly put it: Go here and get ready to get your mind blown., Second time Ive been to Rosess in the last two weeks. It really became my favorite place in town. Is it pricey? Yes, but the food is so worth it. The ambiance is fantastic, servers are hip and fun. Everything down to the silverwear is perfect. Where else do you see a restaurant that works as a team, where chef and hosts also brings food to the table and bus tables? They are really redefining what a restaurant service should be. Im only taking one star off, and it saddens me to do that, because last night the lobster soup didnt taste like lobster at all. First time I came, lobster soup was amazing, this time around it tasted like pure warm milk or warm cream. I hope they stay consistent with the food! Aside this, you guys are doing a beautiful work guys!, A beacon of perfectly executed food, drinks, service, and atmosphere, in a neighborhood where restaurants seemingly struggle to consistently provide all four. Weve already been here several times since it opened and there has yet to be a misstep.The space is beautiful and impeccably decorated, yet the atmosphere remains very casual and approachable. Its clear that they want everyone to feel like family, which is charming in and of itself, but even more amazing is that they actually manage to pull it off. No matter who you talk to -- bartender, server, hostess, chef -- it always feels like you are meeting a new friend. The drinks are outstanding. So good, in fact, that we often just stop in here for cocktails at the bar. My current favorite is the bourbon and rosewater drink, and they make what might be the best martinez I have ever had. If youre not in the mood for anything you see on the menu, weve also had great success by just telling the bartender to make us something wonderful. They might even name it after you. Bonus points if you go in there and ask for The Annie B.And the food. Oh the food. I could go on and on, but I know it has already been (deservedly) fawned over in other reviews, so I will keep this relatively brief. The popcorn soup is obviously a must try, and I can attest that it is still amazing even without the lobster -- Ive had to both ways, since my other half is allergic to shellfish. The other plate I have to plug is the burnt romaine. Its rare for a restaurant to have a satisfying vegetarian dish that isnt dominated by something like butternut squash or sweet potato, and we keep coming back to this dish as our favorite. Im also a sucker for anything with cotija and avocado.I honestly cant say anything bad about this place, other than the fact that it has become so popular that wait times can get long on the weekends (as with anywhere), and they dont take reservations. This hasnt really been a problem for us though, since we love hanging around in the bar area to grab a drink before dinner. Roses is exactly what Barracks Row needed, and we are so excited to have such a great restaurant only a block away. Well be back, again and again, and you should too, as places like this truly deserve our business., What a fun place! Rose Luxury is one reason why Eastern Market is the place to be... again. I lived in DC many years ago and the only spot Eastern Market was known for was the market itself! I went in several days ago with friends just for dessert. We finished dinner at another restaurant on 8th Street and wanted to end the evening with something sweet. Rose Luxury - from what Ie heard and observed - is a very very buzzing place. You cannot do reservations and the wait is very long. Lucky for us, we came in around 10 and by then, our wait time was a mere five minutes. We sat down and despite them knowing we only wanted dessert, still brought us their signature potato brioche with chives and toasted shallot butter. That brioche alone made me wanna have a second dinner so I can eat that with something else. It was so fantastic. I don know what was in that bread, but I wanted to run to the kitchen and demand five loaves of it for me to take home to San Francisco. GOODNESS GRACIOUS. Our server came by and was such a doll! She was vivacious, funny, and genuinely charming. Now, I was a bit embarrassed that we came in just for dessert (she brought us full menus even though we told the hostess it was just for dessert)... but she was super cool about it and said It fine. No worries! I ordered this amazing caramel tea to enjoy with the poached pear and mascarpone as well extra virgin olive oil bread with sea salt and vanilla ice cream. Both desserts were small (so I suggest to not share these), but were packed with flavor and depth. Our server also brought us complementary mint-chocolate meringues with our bill. The outside was crunchy, and the interior was not only chewy (as it should be!), but cooled my insides! It was like having an Andes mint! WILD. How did it do that?! Not only did she bring that with our bill, but after swiping our cards, came back and brought us more for no particular reason. What a sweetheart! Not to completely switch gears (and perhaps disgust you a bit), but I would also check out their restrooms. There are some cheeky wall decorations inside and you can peek downstairs into the dining area from there. The bar area upstairs is sizable in case you wanted a drink. The downstairs dining room looks small, but if you look closely, the restaurant extends to the back beyond the diner-like seating in front of the kitchen. Rose Luxury is a bit hipster-y, but I welcome the aesthetic in a place like DC where the suits run this city!, Great food and excellent atmosphere.If you regularly eat on Barrack Row youl know many of the restaurants have a similar look and similar menu items. Rose Luxury is a refreshing change from the usual on this street. The decor is fresh and tasteful. The food is amazing. The Pork sausage, habanero & lychee salad was out of this world. Their fried chicken is some of the best Ie ever had (don tell my southern wife.) Dessert was just okay, but the main dishes more than made up for it ... maybe consider a milk shake at Ted Bulletin up the street for dessert after dinner instead.It is a bit pricey for the neighborhood, but well worth it. They don take reservations, which is a little annoying. Try and sit at the chef table right next to the kitchen. We did and got to talk to the chefs as well as received a lot free extras through out the meal., I genuinely enjoyed this experience and would slate it as just that, an experience. I went with a close girlfriend who I had not seen for awhile and had much to discuss so thought this would make a great backdrop. I want to preface that although service was attentive and food was outstandingly flavored, I was not impressed by the slow output of the food, or the description of small plates but not really small plates which actually left one extremely hungry at time of departure. This is why I went 4 stars But, to the food...My drink was amazing, it was the first whiskey beverage on the menu(see pic) and was an infusion like none other. My friend had a Pinot Noir that she said wasnt too shabby at all. While waiting on beverages, which took quite awhile to come out, we were given a delicious fresh baked brioche with whipped scallion butter I believe. (See pic) yeah, I kinda wanted to shove the entire loaf in my mouth. Next up, popcorn soup. It was the frothiest, butteriest treat I ever had and need only have once but boy was the lobster surprise at the finish perfect. They even tell you how they make it; I may emulate at home. We then ordered the pickle brined honey fried chicken and it was perfection with four perfectly flavored pieces that I was mad about sharing. :) Lastly, we had the pesto linguinetti that again was unmatched in flavor!! Food was PERFECT and although I was confused about portion sizes, I can say I am currently feeling pretty full. We didnt get dessert but when they bring your check, they give you a mint chocolate chip macaroon that screams eat me now, so we did. Of note are the seat choices. We say at the kitchen table and so were able to overlook every thing that was made. Some were amazing to watch although it is hard watching people make your food with their bare hands. The bill wasnt too bad, and I will probably come back, although again, a smidgen faster with delivery is all I ask. Nice job!!!, After obsessing over the menu for nearly 2 months, my best friend suggested Roses Luxury because she, having started a business that was funded by Kickstarter, also knew that Roses Luxury had raised their startup (or a portion of their startup) money via Kickstarter. I told her there was no chance wed get in on a Saturday but it was about 530 pm and we were quickly seated. I was already ecstatic, excited and damn near blissful. We sat in front of the kitchen, such a great spot. I could go on and on with details of how great this meal was. But I have to say its the entire experience here that merits that 5th star. Everyone on staff is genuinely happy to be there and that happiness and belief in this place being a success definitely manifests itself through the quality of service they provide. My friend went to the bathroom and our fabulous waitress had folded her napkin while she was away. Even the soap in the bathroom is aromatic and just fits with the decor, the vibe, the personality of the restaurant. Service and timing were impeccable. I silently commented to my friend that we could have used an extra toast with our pate thinking hmm this might take away half a star. A few minutes later, our waitress asked if we would like an extra toast. Anticipating and being attuned to diners needs is such an amazing quality in waitstaff. I was certainly won over. Surprisingly the burnt romaine with contija came close to being my favorite dish. If you have 3 people sharing and not 2, Id probably go ahead and order 2 orders, it was that good. And do NOT get me started on the house bread, it melts in your mouth and I never even bother eating bread at restaurants. I enjoyed the popcorn soup with lobster but it wasnt my favorite as I tend to like much bolder flavors - that being said, Id probably still order it again - the flavors blended so well. The fried chicken was fantastic as was the vietnamese pate. Loved the gnocchi and the vanilla ice cream with olive oil dessert. Cocktails were also unique, creative and interesting. For 4 cocktails and the food we ordered, the bill came out to about $130 which in my opinion was a steal. Ive had so many 2-3 star experiences lately where I spent a similar if not higher amount of money and left feeling defeated - Roses Luxury finally filled that void Ive had lately, exceeded my expectations and was just a lovely, lovely meal/experience. I dont know how anyone could not leave here happy., Tonight was my first trip to Roses Luxury and the experience solidified it as one of my favorite spots in the city. The service was phenomenal (thanks Elizabeth!), the food outstanding, and the ambiance very comforting. We also had a serious egg allergy in our group, and everyone--espcially owner/enthusiast Aaron--was extraordinarily accommodating. High fives to everyone!, The food was amazing. The menu was so creative! Everything we tried was delightful. The service was also fantastic. The waiter went out of his way to make us comfortable and made some great recommendations as well. There was a bit of a wait for a table on a Friday night, but it was well worth it! I will be back!, Roses Luxury is FUN! When do you ever say that about a restaurant? Its the hottest restaurant in town, yet has zero pretension or attitude. They want to make good food and leave you satisfied. The space is just adorable. Every little detail, from the menus, to the plants, to the bathroom was done with such thought and sincerity. The food is delightful and whimsical and delicious! Obviously tou must try the popcorn soup, totally weird and amazing. Everything we tasted (which was A LOT) was equally fantastic, surprising, and satisfying. And the servers are CHARMING and wonderful!Yes there is going to be a long wait for dinner, but have a drink upstairs or head down the street, the wait is worth it. This may be the only reason I leave Logan Circle anytime this winter., everything -- from the service to the last bite of salty chocolate goodness -- was exquisite!!! Maybe the best dining experience wee had in DC ever. It was a bargain wait an hour for a table -- we would have waited 2 hours. Try the popcorn soup. Try the gnochhi. Try everything.In conclusion, my husband uttered these words about the fried chicken for the first time ever: it doesn even need hot sauce.Well done, Aaron Silverman!!!, Rose Luxury is arguably the hottest and most talked about restaurant in the past few months in the DC food scene and it has been attracting a LOT of attention. It has received raving reviews from the press with the most recent being Tom Seitsema 3* review published in the Washington Post.It no surprise that this place gets glowing reviews based on Chef Aaron resume. He has no shortage of experience working with top celebrity chefs with a list of names that include David Chang of Momofuku Noodle Bar in NYC, Sean Brock of Husk Restaurant, Marco Canora of Hearth and Terroir, and George Mendes of Aldea.The chef style is something that most people in DC are not accustomed to and he certainly doesn play it safe. Each dish blends in a combination of different ingredients and style of cooking that he incorporated from his past to somehow...get the dishes to make sense and come together to produce an explosion of flavors.The types of food are separated into 4 categories: cold, warm&grill, pasta, and other goods. I sampled:1. Pork sausage, lychee, and habanero salad: the most interesting dish that combined salt, sugar, spice, and vegetable flavorings (onions mostly). 2. Popcorn soup with grilled lobster: molecular gastronomy dish with foam, a very buttery soup with grilled lobster3. Fried chicken- fried chicken with sweet Asian like sauce4. Linguettine w/ Hazelnut Parsley Pesto & Parmesean5. Strawberry SpaghettiI can sum my experience up in two words: amusing & interesting. The dishes (e.g. the pork sausage and habanero salad) fuse a spectrum of ingredients that produce an explosion of flavors. It a bit salty, definitely a bit on the sweeter side, a bit sour, and a bit spicy. Despite the craziness, it somehow magically comes together. I commend the chef on his creative approaches but I ask myself this question. Do I see myself becoming a regular at this restaurant? Would I crave these dishes if I don eat here for a while? My answer is definitely a no.One of the biggest problems that I having is the inevitable comparisons that I making to other molecular gastronomy experiences I had (e.g. Volt, Barmini, etc.). I know it not a fair comparison because they are on completely different pricing points and Rose is not really in that category, but the human brain works in a way that it categorizes something that is unfamiliar into a particular category. The closest group that Rose resembles is those restaurants. I can see one making the argument that Rose Luxury is at bargain price points compared to the aforementioned restaurants and I think it a legitimate argument. However, although I cognizant of that, my brain is working in a such a way that the comparisons are being made to Volt, Barmini, etc based on taste...and it just doesn hold up.The second issue converges on ingredients. While dishes such as the strawberry spaghetti are highly touted due to the eclectic sauce that fuses strawberry and marinara sauce, I find issues with the quality of the noodle. It wasn cooked perfect Al dente and while the noodle quality is much better than what we find at most Italian restaurants, I don feel that it holds up to the standards that I expect in restaurants of this caliber/rating.In sum, I can see customers seeing this place from a couple of different angles and having different opinions. However, I certain on one thing. Because creativity and novelty are the selling points of this restaurant, the same dishes cannot be sold on the menu for a prolonged period of time. Otherwise, it will risk becoming the same old restaurant on the block. With the ever changing taste of foodies in the DC food scene (need I mention the cupcake to doughnut trend or ramen trend?), this is nothing to scoff at. Let hope that the chef continues to push the creative boundaries and create inspiring dishes that excites us., Warm, creative, flavorful, and surprisingly not overpriced. Thanks for a delish meal. It was so nice to have even the chef come out unassumingly with one of our dishes and say hello. We sat in the back, but hope to catch a kitchen bar seat next time. Big fans of the bread appetizer they serve, the lobster popcorn soup, chocolate dessert, array of drinks, cauliflower dish, and def appreciate the rotating menu. Would definitely recommend for dates, good friends reconnecting, and foodies whove lived in DC for a long time and are looking for something fresh and unique., I came here with a group of 5 and we got everything on the menu except for the Brisket (It looked amazing, we were just too full). Every bite of food was incredible. My person favorite was the Cacio E Pepe. It was very simple, but so well done. I recommend going here for a full dinner or for drinks and a quick app. All of the drinks we had were expertly crafted as well.The Foie Gras French Toast was insane., I had the best meal in a really, really long time at Roses Luxury recently. I have to say that it is, definitively, my favorite restaurant in DC. I am excited to go back in the spring when they change up their menu, something I cant say for any other restaurant here. Service is great, atmosphere is cozy. The reviews on Yelp are quite extensive, and right now the average rating is 5 stars, so I wont waste your time since youre going to go anyway. Heres a quick list of what to get:Popcorn soup - Was highly skeptical but was delicious. Would eat a whole bowl of this, much to Sietsemas discomfort Im sure.Pasta with hazelnut pesto: had a bit of sweetness which was unexpected but still delicious.Brussels sprouts salad: Amazing and refreshing, but for $12 it was a tiny bowl. For a bowl of what is essentially vegetables I expected a bit more heft. Pickle-brined fried chicken: Friends thought this was the best dish of the night.Schnitzel: Sietsema is right; the actual pork is nothing special but the accompaniments make the dish.But please, please dont get the burnt romaine. I dont know why this is on the menu, or on any other menu on the planet. Its not worth the $11 or the calories you could be inhaling with something else., When I wake up in the morning, I thank sweet baby Jesus for Roses Luxury. I have been about 5 times since it opened, and each time it rocks. The menu is small and can be off-putting if you are a picky eater. However, the unique pairing of ingredients brings out delicious flavors in foods you thought you hated. The dishes are small and can be shared, but Im greedy and enjoy getting my own! I have yet to have an unpleasant dish! Some of my favorites dishes are: Pork Sausage and Habanero Lychee Salad (make sure you mix it up!)Burnt Romaine with Avocado, Poblano, & Cotija cheese Popcorn Soup (w/grilled lobster)Pickle-Brined fried chicken, Honey and Benne seedSmoked Brisket (there is also a brisket sandwich not on the menu!)Their freshly baked potato bread is so good too....Customer service is relaxed, but awesome. Go there. Now., In the middle of my dinner here I swear I started getting light headed. Why? Because I was so darn happy, it must have been food coma bliss. Jaimin S. and I waited an 1hr45min to be seated for dinner on a Saturday night. Normally we wouldn do such a thing, but it smelled too good not to. First of all, I love this place because they are willing to accommodate vegetarians. Several of the dishes on the menu are either vegetarian or can be made that way...score!Favorites (everything is pretty much tapas style/portions):Ricotta Stuffed Gnocci - looked more like ravioli and was soo soo soo good. So many subtle flavors that were just amazing together. Cacio E Pepe - Lupa in NYC makes the best version of this that Ie ever had. This is a very close second. The pasta was perfectly cooked and chewy and there just the right amount of pepper in this dish. yum!Linguettine w/parsley pesto - another great pasta dish, but probably my 3rd favorite. The pesto was quite good and pasta was cooked perfectly.Pommes Puree - OMG OMG. I think Ie died and gone to potato heaven. This is basically the best buttery mashed potatoes that youl ever have with some crispy potato skins and chives mixed in. We didn care for the red wine sauce; happy we asked for it on the side.We opted for the burnt romaine dish and didn really care for the burnt pieces of lettuce. The avocado, poblano, and cotija were perfect though. I would have preferred a normal salad with all these things instead. Oh I almost forgot. They bring you homemade potato bread at the beginning which is absolutely divine. The outside is crispy, the inside is pillow soft. And the butter with chives...omg. Our waitress was a complete peach and so helpful in answering any questions. This was really one of the best meals Ie had in a long time. Comfort food at its finest. And a completely random find for me!, One of my favorite dining experiences in DC. Great food, unpretentious. The oysters topped with a Bourbon-Ginger Ale granita was the best oyster preparation I have ever had. The Sausage and Lychee salad was outstanding. The fried chicken and brisket were both delicious. The popcorn and lobster soup was my least favorite dish, but it wasnt bad at all. And, to top it off, they had some great cocktails. Will definitely go back to try more dishes., Ive only ever had drinks (wine) at Roses Luxury, but I highly recommend. Great service, friendly bartenders and an excellent selection of wine. Ill definitely be back for dinner soon., All-time meal. Rolled up at 6pm on a Saturday and was met with a 2.5 hour wait, would have been fine but we snagged a couple seats at the bar in less than half the time. Service was just as awesome. Mike was the man. Lineup:Pork and lychee (Insane)Popcorn soupCacio e pepe (Insane)Burnt romaineFried chicken (Insane)Poached peach + cinnamon French Toast for dessert, I was looking forward to going to Roses Luxury for weeks. I went with a friend on a Monday night, and we had an overall lovely experience.We put our names down around 6:15 and told there would be an hour, hour and a half wait. Went upstairs and had drinks while we waited. One of the best things about this place is that they have servers who walk around the upstairs area taking drink orders so you dont have to try to wedge in at the bar. WHY HAS NO ONE THOUGHT OF THIS BEFORE?We checked in downstairs after a little over an hour to see where we were on the list, and there were still eight groups ahead of us. It probably would have been over an hour and a half--I hope theyre able to better quote waits in the future. We were lucky enough to have a bartender offer to add a stool to another seat at the bar that freed up so we could sit and have dinner.We ordered the fried chicken, brisket sandwich (only available at the bar, and a good alternative if you dont want the 20-some-odd-dollar giant platter of brisket), cacio e pepe, pasta with hazelnut and parsley pesto, and burnt romaine. I liked the fried chicken for sure, especially the hot sauce addition they bring with it. But I wasnt crazy about the amount of honey that was on it--a bit too sweet for my taste. The burnt romaine was great, but we didnt get much romaine compared to the amount of sauce--if there was more, Id definitely order it again.For the favorites, now. The brisket jus that came with the sandwich was downright drinkable. That shit was smoky, salty, and beefy. Damn. The bread that comes out first is a potato and chive bread that comes with a whipped butter topped with chives and breadcrumbs that look like bacon, and damned if it doesnt taste exactly like a baked potato with sour cream and chives. I could eat that every dang day. The pastas were downright decadent--so creamy. Apparently, the pesto has no butter or cheese in it, which is nuts, because it was so creamy and rich.Aaron, the chef/owner, was delivering plates, talking to customers, and even helping to fix a malfunctioning dishwasher behind the bar--he clearly cares. And he was at the host stand on the way out, so we were able to talk to him about some of the dishes. He could not have been nicer, and he seemed like he had all the time in the world--we didnt feel like underlings trying to get a word in with the king.Overall, a great meal flavor-wise. On my next visit, I will definitely (a) not come starving, (b) add some wait time to time given, and (c) order the potato puree and Vietnamese pate and six of the hazelnut and pesto pastas., spot on across the board...food, service and setting. Theyre doing some really creative things that are all ridiculously delicious. Service is great. Bartenders are interactive with good conversation and make some killer drinks. Waitstaff knows the menu, knows the prep, and knows the ingredients. The physical restaurant itself is also amazing, with a great mixture of old and new. Cant wait to go back...and this is coming from a long time restaurant worker (10+ years) who is picky about everything., It really lived up to the hype! We came for New Years Eve dinner, $75 for 2 small plates per person and you share a family style plate, 2 desserts, and 2 glasses of champagne (but they refilled us), PLUS you got a hangover kit which included $20 off your next visit. So all in all, the value was very close to what you would have gotten if it wasn NYE.I not sure what I can add to the raving reviews here, but we were extremely impressed with the service. We didn have just one waiter, we were really being taken care of by a few different people. My absolutely favorite was the potato puree, and my fiancee favorite was the popcorn soup. The brisket was incredible as well. We will be on the look out for when the menu changes, every plate they do is damn near perfection., Couldnt have asked for a better restaurant experience! Service was amazing -- staff were attentive, knowledgeable and very helpful. We got there at 5:15pm and were seated immediately. By 6pm, the restaurant was already full. Started with cocktails which were all delicious and worth every cent. Popcorn soup was so soft and buttery, Vietnamese pate, fried chicken, brisket were made to perfection. After the meal, my taste buds were completely partied out. Wish we had room for some dessert but we opted for another round of cocktails! Highly recommend the bourbon w Rose water and the fat infused moonshine with cider. We will definitely be back!, Yes. Yes. Yes. We had an awesome experience at Rose Luxury and for good reasons its impossible to get a table. Its a bit of a hike for those of us living in Cleveland park, but whatever. We were lucky to snag the last four person table, which we attribute to the scary looking snowflakes falling. We tried two cocktails - the one with rose water and the moonshine. (Our waitress was super cool and accidentally made the moonshine, which she brought us anyway along with the rose water!) Rose water was nice and loved the presentation in the Moroccan tea cup like thing, although couldn particularly distinguish the rose water. Moonshine was delish. period. Potato bread while waiting was warm and, uh, luscious. Exactly what you want out of bread service when you can escape from your healthy whole-wheat multigrain for an evening. Butter with chives (and bacon?) was the perfect fat kid choice to go with it. Since there were a good number of us we got to order a fair few dishes. First off were oysters, which were tasty and quite brine-y if you like that. Next up was the pork/lychee madness which, like everyone says, is incredible. Bursts of all the flavors at once - crunchy peanut, bright cilantro, creamy coconut milk, sweet lychee, salty pork - was just so ideal it was insane. Next we had the popcorn and lobster soup. We ended up sharing one soup between the four of us, which was a mixup, but it was superb. The healthy chunk of succulent lobster at the bottom was juicy and flavorful, as was the soup. And the missing dish allowed us to order another!Next up was the crispy brussel sprouts which could be termed a warm salad. The brussels were actually charred, splayed leaves rather than the usual half chunk of brussel, which made for a lighter feel. The mix (which included fennel!!) was a perfect offset to the other dishes, which tended to be heavier. We LOVED this dish.Our replacement for our lost soup was the crawfish with grits, which had a little kick in the sauce. The crawfish was perfectly flash fried with what seemed like cornmeal (check that with your waiter/waitress) which gave it a crunch and a little nuttiness. We literally sopped up the sauce with our bread, no shame at all. Next we ordered the cacio e pepe because of everything we heard. And yeah, it deserved every, single ounce of praise. My sister ate the rest of the sauce with a spoon. No one cared about clogged arteries at our table. Lastly we got the brisket to share. Loved all that smoke and the fat was scary but BOMB. The winter slaw (watermelon radish, red cabbage, apple etc.) was especially to die for. Can we get some take out?Throughout dinner we had a couple of glasses of the Wildwood Pinot Noir, which was truly good. Fruity, juicy and a little more full-bodied than other pinots I have dabbled in. I want some bottles for home please!If there was ONE thing that I wasn totally on the same page with its the desserts. It was snowy so I didn feel like ice cream (sorry, but I just prefer cake), which I am sure is nice since they make it in house. I also didn feel like any more savory so the foie gras was out, although I know I should go back for it. No one else wanted olive oil cake either, which I can understand because it can be too much for some peoplestaste buds. The rest of my party ended up going with the poached pair with marscapone to share. It was too tiny to split really (pear variety was tiny and we were four...didn do the math) but I just wasn impressed with the lineup. I am a total dessert person, but nothing made want to eat dessert. The mint choco-chip meringue that came with the check was much better and much more satisfying! Give me some of those and a hot chocolate PLEASE. But no matter. Place is lovely, waitress was fab and our food was out of this world. Just because I didn get my dessert doesn mean its not an incredible restaurant; it truly deserves all the praise it gets. Just be prepared to order (and spend) a lot since dishes are smaller. It may not be tapas size, but its still very small plate size, so sharing with more than one other person may be tricky. Keep that in mind and enjoy this incredible place before it gets to Komi status and getting in will be in possible!, Im a big fan of this place. Came here for New Years Eve, and was very impressed by everything.First of all, I like the vibe that this is going for. Wood ceilings with stringed lights. Waiters in tuxedo t-shirts. and the complimentary new years eve hangover cure doggy bag (including bottled water, emergen-c, alka seltzer, chewing gum, and 5-hour energy shot). The popcorn soup is a must. Yes, its really rich, and with our table of 8, we were able to split 3 bowls into delectable single servings with chunky pieces of lobster at the bottom of our cups. And the lychee salad is unlike anything Ive experienced before. And, I love lychees. Their master cocktail-ologist also does a nice job. Both the irish egg nog, and whatever it was that I drank (a mixture of sage, grapefruit juice, ginger beer, and smoky mezcal) were tantalizing., I am so happy to have this restaurant in DC. It fills a much needed niche in our dining scene: chef-driven, fun, creative, casual and generous. This is a combo Im always hoping and looking for in dc. Quite a few of our more creative restaurants are fairly expensive and formal. I appreciate them but dont enjoy the atmosphere. Ive visited restaurants in other cities that had this particilar combination of qualities and always hoped for more of those places here in my hometown. Roses is it. I look forward to many more visits. Favorite restaurant in dc right now. Easily. Yes we waited in line. Yes it was miserably cold. Yes it was worth it. I wont detail the dishes we had but they were many and everything was amazing. Also, they say they are committed to an evolving menu, so if you are particularly interested in a dish you have read about you should probably visit soon. Cheers., As I reminisce on my meal at Roses Luxury I feel a warmth rise from inside me and spread through my bones. Roses Luxury is potentially one of my fondest memories at a dining establishment. What really made Roses so spectacular was that it wasnt merely about the food - it was the experience. The dishes were like a culinary adventure that I was embarking on with my companion at a quaint refuge from the bustle of everyday life. It felt like each small plate was painstakingly crafted and made with a true passion for food. We ordered: Popcorn Soup - The first sip was chock full of rich buttery flavor with undertones of corn. While I could not consume too much of this, it was an innovative dish that was pleasing to the palate. Gnocchi - These were more like pierogies than gnocchi, but nonetheless they melted in my mouth like a cloud. They were stuffed with ricotta and had a delicate mushroom sauce. Fried Oysters - The only dish that didnt truly impress me, the breading of the oysters was similar to a cornmeal and consumed the oyster flavor. However the bed of risotto and black eyed peas the oysters sat on had a lovely texture. Pork and Lychee Salad - One of the most intriguing entrees on the menu due to the complete cacophony of ingredients that somehow came together into a symphony of flavors. The pork sausage, red onion slivers, lychee, coconut cream and toasted garlic was delightful after it was properly mixed. The sweetness of the lychee created a sour tang when paired with the pork and onion. The cream held the dish together with light folds of coconut swirled amongst the solid ingredients. Fried Chicken - Coated in a super light batter and drizzled with honey, this was the kind of fried chicken that you wouldnt feel disgusting or sick after eating. The hot sauce had a fiery sour taste that paired well with the chicken. It was a generous portion as well! Poached Pear - Heaven entered my mouth when I had my first bite of this. A small perfectly poached pair was encrusted with nuts and sat on a cloud of home whipped mascarpone. The pear was so soft, the flesh easily parted from the core. The nuttiness of the poached pear and the chewy flesh was perfect with the slightly sour mascarpone. The two textures danced in my mouth as they easily melted on my tongue. Roses is absolutely amazing! I know its difficult to get a seat at a young restaurant and it may come off as pretentious that they dont take reservations but it is worth it. The waitstaff is perfectly attentive, knowledgeable and enthusiastic about their work. The chef and owners care greatly about food and providing a wonderful experience to those who dine here. The entire experience is lovely and one I will always remember!, Its insanely good. Wife and I went for our anniversary in Nov (informed of a 30 minute wait - we idled with a beer at Mollys next door) eventually seated at the bar by the open kitchen. Amazing experience across the board. Each dish was fantastic, watching them assemble plates was fun. The people sitting next to us were so blown away by a squid ink dish they insisted we taste it. (it was phenomenal)On the next visit later in Dec at 6 PM on a TUESDAY we were informed at the door that the wait was approaching 2 hours. No bueno. Toki Underground syndrome. I guess if youre planning a visit, maybe call and put your name on the list an hour (or two) before you plan to arrive? Hopefully theyll keep up their extremely high standards for producing unique and delicious small plates, per our first and only visit - it lives up to the hype!, We were lucky enough to grace this restaurant on New Year Eve. Our waitress, Bobbi, was arguably the life of the party when she came to check on us! I can even comment on anything else about the appearance of the restaurant because it doesn matter when compared to the food. Before we ordered drinks, we were surprised with a place of small surprise raw oysters. They were, in all honesty, the most unique and wonderfully flavored oysters Ie ever had. I wish I remembered what was on them! I ordered a drink: the jalape31o, maple, and whiskey drink. It was HOT! But the flavor of that drink was mesmerizing. My mouth burned like hell, but I kept drinking because the flavor was so good! I will have a hard time ordering another drink because Il want to keep tasting that one! For my small plates, I got the pork sausage with habanero & lychee. Ie never had these flavors mixed together before. Il try not to be dramatic here: it is a dish that deserves an award. The dish is capsaicin-induced painful brilliance! (if that makes sense) I also got the burnt romaine with avocado, poblano, and cotija cheese (I seeing a pepper trend here). While I wasn the biggest fan of the burnt leaves, it no less was a pleasantly unique texture and flavor. The dish, overall, was yet another beautiful mix of flavors.Since we rang in the New Year there, we were given yet another wonderful surprise (no doubt a surprise that Southerner would be astonished to find in DC). The staff all brought out little cocottes of greens and black-eyed peas for good luck in the New Year! It was above and beyond, to say the least.As for the main course, this is the only dish that I was only slightly disappointed in. After the incredible dishes I had before, the brisket did not wow me like the other dishes did. This is not, at all, to say that it was a bad dish. The meat was tender and the fixins went well with it. I just thought it was a little lacking in the uniqueness of the other dishes.At this point, I do not remember ordering dessert, but one came out anyway. It was able to save the day after the brisket. The chocolate mousse was some of the most fluffy yet dense texture Ie ever had and the flavor was, of course, decadent. 5 stars.I will gladly pour a glass of champagne and toast this place. Happy New Year and Happy Eating!, I usually dont trust Yelps review - but I am very glad that I stumbled onto this place! Place is very cozy... simple food but exceptionally executed.oh yea- DONT GET BURNT ROMAINE, wth was that really? That was piece of S****. But everything else was so wonderful- They have good selection of liquor... And desserts were soo bleh too. We ordered the vanilla ice cream with something, my bf got pear and they gave me this chocolate something. All of them were very small portion, but we didnt finish them because they were not that good- just average........ waiter was very knowledgable and friendly. We are definitely going back! It was one of the most intriguing dining experience ever Ive had! And I have been to many many restaurants- all around the world :), Wow. Thats all I can say. Wow...in a good way.My wife and I went here looking for a new place in our neighborhood (Barracks Row) and any restaurant with 82 reviews (now 83 reviews) with 5 stars makes you curious if it is really that good or are they paying people to give them the thumbs up....After 1.5 hours here, we are convinced they really are that good.We walked in and there was only seats at the garden bar. We thought we were getting the shaft but instead we found the gem of the restaurant. Brian N is the bar tender at the garden bar and is amazing: makes amazing drinks and has a great demeanor. My wife and I ordered the cider off the menu and it was amazing. Then we tested Brians knowledge and asked him to surprise us and he got our preferred drinks spot on! We ordered the brisket (amazing and definitely enough for two). Before the brisket came out, we got freshly made bread with amazing butter...for free. Then they brought out popcorn soup (made from lobster) for free...My wife told me after finishing the soup that she will crave this which means well be back for sure. The brisket came and then afterwards a cheese dessert came out that rocked our world...for free! Before leaving, my wife needed to check out the bathroom because that really can prevent a 5 star rating....The bathrooms were great and my wife loved the CO Bigelow rosemary mint soap (She told me to write that).GO GO GO to Roses Luxury....even if you are not near Capitol Hill....GO!!!!!!!, I spent my birthday here and boy did I have a great time. Service was top notch with the waiters knowing everything about the dishes and happy to share. Best table I think is by the kitchen. While waiting we were going to have drinks upstairs but they quickly sat us on a Wednesday night after a short 15 min wait. Definitely order the special birthday dessert, you wont regret it . All the dishes were amazing, I cant choose a favorite, although the dishes were small, its perfect to share with 2 people (except for the family style meals)., I think I found the first restaurant in DC that I am excited about and want a lot of other people to be excited about too. The name is Rose Luxury and it is located on Barracks Row. It a small ish restaurant that does not take reservations. I fully support that policy. The menu is small but has more than enough options. It fits the mood and mold of the establishment. There are four sections (cold, warm, pasta and other goods), plus a family style section with two large, share-able plates. Each of the other sections offer three, small and share-able choices with more than half available as or made vegetarian. In addition to a nice menu and small but inviting dining space, the staff was tremendous top-to-bottom. From the moment we walked in to put our names down (quoted hour and 45 minutes on a Friday night), the services was friendly, gracious, funny and attentive. They take your phone number to text you when the table is ready but since they were running late we got a phone call with apologies (I think unnecessary but welcome) and free cocktails when we sat down. As you can see from the photos the china and flatware are flat out awesome. Vintage but classy, with detail on the spoons, and awesome use of the small copper pot. It just adds and compliments the complete aesthetic of the experience. What you can see from the pictures is how good the food tasted, without exception. The bread with bacon bit butter was a great way to start the meal and required restraint to not ruin an appetite. Most restaurants with small plates suggest 2-3 per person. I think you only need 2 at Rose because the food is rich and filling enough.We started with the crispy sprouts (with tarragon, mint and winter citrus vinaigrette) and pork sausage, habanero & lychee salad. I loved the sprout salad and would eat that every night. The mint is a great touch with the vinaigrette. A really nice dish. I enjoyed the lychee salad but it not a flavor or consistency for everyone. The habanero and pork sausage are fun when mixed well with the lychee and cream/onions. The main dishes, if you call them that, more like second round of small dishes was the classic french ommes puree(with crispy potato skins and red wine sauce) and a pasta special with shaved white truffles. Yea, I was sold as soon as I hear white truffle. The pasta was fantastic and rich and delicious and I want some more right now. Not a cheap dish as a special but worth every penny. I forget if we ordered the dessert or if they brought it out special. Since I donhave any record of it or remembered exactly what it was I won comment. But it was tasty. If we had room we would ordered the popcorn soup since everyone raves about it. Ie been somewhat down on the DC eating scene recently but Rose has brought back the faith. It the best meal Ie had in the city and a very well rounded dining experience with great service, delicious food and a fun atmosphere. I afraid if too many people catch on the already long wait times get silly, but that the price to pay for a great meal. Look forward to getting back soon.
60|rpm-italian-washington|I was very excited to go to this restaurant because I really enjoyed the food in the original Chicago establishment. The food, and most of the food that is available in Chicago is also here in Washington.Standouts are the carbonara (mixed tableside), the octopus appetizer, and the 600 day prosciutto. Very professional and quick service. These are industry people, not just bartenders and waiters during the weekend.The vibe is way more upscale than I had given it credit for! Most people were dressed up. A new place to see and to be seen. Highly recommend., Ate here tonight with some of my fellow Chicagoans as we are fans of the original RPM. The food was fantastic and the service was top notch. The ambiance is quite familiar to their Chicago location: smart and sophisticated. I ordered the cavatteli, my husband ordered the chicken parm. We took the staffs suggestions for wine pairings and it made a difference in our experience. Overall we enjoyed the experience and it was money well spent., First, I would like to agree with the previous review that this restaurant is slightly more upscale than I had envisioned. I was wearing fitted jeans and a collared shirt which was sub par for dining here. The girlfriend and I decided on two starters, two pastas, and a dessert. All of which were exceptional. Nduja crostini - 4 little bites a perfect combination of spicy sweet mushy and crunchy. A great starter with a lot of flavor.Angelo & Franco burrata - dish is a bit small but the burrata is delicious and the figs they paired it with pair really well. It comes with focaccia bread and wow that stuff is tasty.Black truffle strozzapreti - wow. Just wow. I literally stopped talking to my girlfriend after I devoured the first bite. Concentration on anything other than this dish is nearly impossible. So if you come here planning to have great conversation and you get this just remember youve been warned. Carbonara - this pasta was silly good too. They split the egg right in front of your and toss it into your pasta. I cant remember the last time I enjoyed pasta as much as i did here. Torta meringata - big enough for 4 people but so good youre glad that there is only two of you eating it. They flame the dish table side and pour chocolate over the top as you salivate. It tastes even better than it looks.My only complaint would be the restaurant is a bit chilly. Other than that there service was amazing never had to worry about our table having dirty dishes or I filled water. Our waitress was on it and knew her stuff about the dishes as well. She was able to list the cheeses off the top of her head in my dish. I WILL be back!, Ambiance- the dining area was very sleek, modern yet sophisticated- noise level was fine so you could still have a conversation and not have to scream - the bar area was a large space but darker than I expected Kyles TIP for Management - open up the blinds and curtains in the bar area and take advantage of the huge Windows CocktailsTen Cent Pistol - similar to a Kentucky mule but has some grapefruit juice in it that softens the flavor of the ginger. Definitely worth getting if you like bourbon and gingerOld fashioned - you know I like mine stiff and their old fashion didnt disappoint. Its a classic American cocktail and they nailed it. Wine Pinot noir - went with the $13 glass because the other option was $25 which is a bit steep. Wish they more options in the $10-15 range but the glass I had was fine for my meal. FoodLobster caprese - definitely worth getting. You could taste the freshness of the ingredients. The lobster melted in your mouth. The cheeeeese was creamy and really delivered the fresh mozzarella flavor. The tomatoes exploded with flavor and the pesto brought the whole dish together. I recommend getting a little bit of everything in one bite. Your mouth will thank you for it. Prime beef meatballs - I am not a huge ball of meat fan but these are worth getting even if youre like me. The ingredients make the dish. You can tell it is made with prime beef. Each ball was more moist than the next. The sauce was the perfect complement because it didnt overpower the beef. Mama depandis pomodoro - this is a classic Italian pasta dish. It was good but nothing special. If you want something classic then give it a try but if not then I would venture out and try another pasta dish. Spicy king crab - this dish packed a lot of flavor and some heat. I like to sweat when I eat but unfortunately this wasnt that hot. However, it was an excellent dish. The crab was tasty and the pasta delightful. If you do like heat, ask for them to throw a few more peppers on there and that should do the trick. Id recommend getting this dish. Dessert Hazelnut tartufo - this is their signature dessert and it is strong to quite strong. The ice cream is velvety and the outside chocolate adds a nice crunch to each bite. Definitely get this dessert but be careful because it can be a challenge to eat. Service The waitstaff was very professional and attentive. They provided new utensils after each course. We always had our water filled as well. Overall - an excellent dining experience and worth checking out., RPM Restaurants have been known for bringing high-quality Italian and steak dinners to people all around Chicago. Today RPM Restaurants has introduced a new Italian restaurant in Washington. RPM Italian on 601 Massachusetts Avenue NW was established by a team that includes famed chef Doug Psaltis among many other prominent names.RPM Italian focuses on a contemporary menu that is heavily driven by the chefs who make the foods here. The restaurant has some great meals to choose from during all parts of the meal.I went to RPM Italian with my wife and parents as we were looking to try something. The place was newly opened as it had been around for three days at the time of our reservation. We all loved the place and never felt as full in our lives as we had been there.Start With Some DrinksWe started with some great drinks here. The Cucumber Cup mixed Tequila Tromba with cucumber and lime to create some great tones. The Old Fashioned included Rittenhouse Rye Whiskey and Demerara and Angostura to create a more intense flavor. The drink menu included plenty of fine wines from all over Italy to add a special feel that was certainly exciting for all people to look forward to trying out.A Great MealFor dinner, we started with Focaccia and Garlic Bread. This was freshly made and crafted with a strong attention to detail to make for a memorable start.The Frito Misto antipasti featured calamari and soft shell crab that was brilliantly smoked and prepared evenly. I loved how the flavors just stood out all over the table as the scent was instantly impeccable.The spaghetti with meatballs and Italian salad were carefully crafted with a rich series of spices. The basil and Pomodoro were mixed in quite well to create some great flavors that were certainly outstanding and entertaining.We finished with the Bomboloni warm donuts with lemon curds. The meals were carefully cooked and filled with some rich flavors that added a strong and intense flavor that certainly added to the excitement of the meal.We loved the great food here and were certainly filled after an entire evening of dining. We were excited over the many different foods there and certainly enjoyed our time out here.What About the D39cor?I should also mention that this was all held in a space that was very inviting. The service was very prompt and caring as the people often had their own recommendations for what to enjoy with their meals. The interior also had a darker tone with plenty of fine leather surfaces for relaxing and some muted lighting that evoked a sense of calm and luxury all around the place.It was great to enjoy a night at RPM Italian. I encourage people who are looking for high-quality foods with some great textures and tones all around to give RPM Italian a try. You might be surprised at the quality of the foods that you will come across as you enjoy dining out at this fine establishment., Just as amazing if not better than the original in Chicago. Everything was incredible and we will be back again. It is a place to see and be seen. Dress to impress, why not? And be ready to splurge, 3 courses? Why not four.DECOR - hubs said reminds me of Vegas. I guess he right as it reminds me of some of the fabulous and luxurious upscale restaurants in Vegas. If youe been to the original, this will look familiar to you. True, this is created by the same team who owns and operates Maggiano but there nothing mom and pop about this place and it a good thing. All the tables are either full booths or partial booths. The lighting is perfected - spot lights for the menus, but otherwise quite calming and relaxing. The walls have a streamlined plaster application which has me in awe and excited to be in the new it restaurant.DRINKS were fab - first a Bellini followed by 2 Nationals (sophisticated concoction of apricot, pineapple, and rum). Oh, and a sippy cup for our 2 year old son - thanks G for thinking of the kids!STARTERS We had tomato & watermelon salad, 600-day prosciutto with AMAZING Italian bread -it worth getting just for the bread. PASTA - hello!?!?!? We then moved on to the prosciutto tortellini with rosemary sauce which was perfectly light and cooked to perfection - al dente - the filling is ground - think ground pork. I normally don get tortellini because it typically bland, but I knew that they could pull it off, and pull it off they did. I order this dish 100 times over. We also had the spicy king crab spaghetti nero. It was extremely buttery and the noodles were streamlined. Hubs loved this dish, I also thought it was unusual and inventive. Luckily we also got to try their typical spaghetti since they made a special dish just for our 2 year old son (spaghetti with a mild cheese sauce). Wow, their normal noodles are also incredible.SWEETS For dessert, we did it up and got the Tableside Service Torta Meringata gelato cake flamb39ed at your table then they pour a chocolate sauce over it to put out the fire. It was an impressive display and made the evening magical. So much so that people are going ga-ga for the pictures on my facebook page. It was impressive. And delicious - the cake is covered in marshmallow goo which then gets charred ever so slightly. Yum., Great food and sexy atmosphere. Perfect spot for a date night or a night out with friends., Had been patiently waiting for RPM to open and it was well worth the wait! They still may be working out some kinks with reservations, as we had to wait over 30 minutes for our table. This gave us a chance to take in some cocktails and enjoy the RPM vibe. Owner/Founder and celebrity entrepreneur Bill Rancic (of Apprentice fame) was in the restaurant interacting with customers. The bar was large and in the center of all of the activity, perfect for catching up with a few friends or grabbing pre/post dinner drinks. On the outskirts of the bar were booths and high top tables, which gave off an upscale lounge vibe unlike many other restaurants in DC. The restaurant had a healthy buzz with light music playing. Cocktails were good, albeit a little pricey. When our table was ready, we were ushered to the left side of the entrance which was better lit, had many tables for diners, and looked like it had good event space for private parties. Service was fantastic! The staff was extremely apologetic about the wait and provided us with complimentary appetizers. Throughout the evening Adam, our waiter, along with other staff made sure that we were well-taken care of. They all were very friendly and provided us with some solid recommendations. The food was very tasty. For appetizers, we enjoyed the 600 Day Prosciutto which came with toasted bread, peppers, and was a good size for sharing (for 2 people about 8-10 pieces or so). The swordfish was the best that I have ever had! Hands-down! We also enjoyed the Carbonara. With a menu that boasted pasta, artisanal pizza, seafood, steaks, and chicken, we will certainly be back for more. We found ourselves eyeing other dishes people were ordering and everything looked delicious. We devoured our side - Corn and Pancetta - and will certainly be back for more.One recommendation, save room for dessert! Although it was for 2-4 people, the two of us could not help polishing off the Torta Meringata, a salted caramel and vanilla gelato cake light on fire before your very eyes. It was delicious and the little extra flare added to the experience. Given the excellent food, service, and scene, we will certainly be back for more!, What an amazing meal! Our expectations were exceeded. Our server Jake was meticulous. Ask for him!, Everyone seems to love this place but I wasn feeling it. Il start with the good... The interior is gorgeous. The truffled garlic bread is to die for. The people watching is entertaining.We sat at the bar intending on eating dinner and having drinks. It took a really long time to order cocktails and once we ordered, it took forever for them to arrive. We asked the waiter for a menu and as we looked over the menu, my boyfriend and I discussed finishing our drinks and grabbing a Taylor sandwich instead.There was just nothing on the menu that made me think I have to eat this and pay $50 for it. I can remember the last time I walked in a new DC restaurant and felt that way... Kinship, nope. Momofuku, nope. Convivial, nope. The Dabney, nope. Pineapple and Pearls, nope. Little Serow, nope.We opted to order the truffle garlic bread and the soft shell crab fritto misto, had a couple more cocktails and left. The fritto misto was really just a tempura fried soft shell crab- it was meh. There were two fried cherry peppers on the plate, other than that the dish was bland. The truffled garlic bread was amazing and perhaps make it worth returning for HH and snacks., 3.5 StarsStopped by on a Thursday evening to celebrate my birthday! There was no availability through open table but managed to get a reservation via phone. Got there 15 minutes early, host stand said they were running behind, so we waited at the bar for about 45 minutes until they were ready.The bar is sleek and sexy. Black and white color palate with some moderately loud (for a bar) house music gave it a very Miami feel. The bar was pretty slow, it took about 20-25 minutes to get a glass of wine and a spritz and giggles. There seemed to have been a mix up at the host stand. I suspect we were seated under a different couples name, most likely it was the couple next to us. After 30 minutes after our reservation time, we went to follow-up with the host stand who said they were ready to seat us. We were sat in the dining room and were brought over champagne with a Happy Anniversary message. We said thanks, and figured they got the birthday/anniversary occasion confused. I then got a text saying our table was ready which I just figured was lagging. Five minutes later, a couple was sat next to us who was celebrating their anniversary. I think the restaurant must have caught the mistake, as they were immediately given some apps on the house. A bit awkward though!Dinner moved along easily from there. Our server was very nice and the food timing was great. For appetizers, we chose the tiger prawns and the meatballs. Forewarning, the tiger prawn app is only one tiger prawn. The prawn is massive though, like fork and knife big, otherwise you look like youre eating a turkey leg. The meatballs were really tasty, the marinara portion generous and the meat was nice and juicy! Definitely a highlight of the evening!For main course, we did the veal chop, the lobster ravioli, the pappardelle ragu, and the chicken parm. The veal chop was the surprise and was really fantastic. It was bursting with flavor and perfectly cooked but I thought, on the small side. We can spend $55 at steakhouses in DC and get a much larger and just as tasty piece of meat. The lobster ravioli is not the traditional with the cream sauce and cheese instead it is in a chili sauce and had a surprising spicy kick to it. The pappardelle was pretty decent and standard. Unfortunately, the chicken parm fell a little short. It was a little too heavy with the mozzarella and was boring.We wanted to try the flaming dessert but over ordered on the entrees. Well have to save that for next time!Sidenote: There are 3 private dining spaces in the back of their restaurant.Sidesidenote: It was really cold in the restaurant! Bring a sweater!, Had the best experience ever. When you mix great food with great service you end up with a superb night. Marcos the waiter was professional and polite and knew the menu well. Had the lobster in a diavolo sauce which was delicious. The restaurant was modern and trendy., My family and I had a wonderful dinner at RPM Italian. No opening week jitters for this place! We had been to RPM in Chicago, and were excited to order our favorite items and some new ones in DC. Specifically, we ordered the meatball appetizer (served in a slightly sweet and delicious tomato sauce), the brussels salad (so refreshing and tasty), and the truffle garlic bread, which we downed in no time. We shared three pastas: Mama DePandis bucatini pomodoro, the truffle pasta, and the carbonara. They were all so, so good, but we voted and agreed that the simplest -- but done so well -- was our favorite (the bucatini). We also ordered the chicken piccata and swordfish, along with the flambeed gelato torta (so yummy!). They brought us an extra dessert because we were celebrating a birthday, which was great as well. The service was spectacular; the waitress was attentive but not overbearing, and very friendly. The restaurant was chic but not too pretentious. Id be equally happy there with family/friends as I would with work colleagues/clients. I cannot WAIT to go back!, Third visit in two weeks and I am officially obsessed with this place. Ive been ordering different items at each visit so that eventually I eat the whole menu.APPETIZERS:Tuna Carpaccio: At first I wasnt sure about the combination with pistachios and olives but the tuna melts in your mouth and the olives added a great saltiness with a nuttiness from the pistachios along with the textural contrast.Lobster Caprese: Perfectly cooked lobster tail accompanied by three balls of buffalo mozzarella with cherry tomatoes that were sweet to balance out the olive oil in the bottom.ENTREES:Filet Mignon: I had to convince the boyfriend to order steak at an Italian restaurant and I can comfortably say that this is one of my favorite filets ever hands down. It had a great char with a peppered crust and the meat was so velvety smooth. I can only describe it as that, it was so easy to slice through. We opted for medium rare and I ate the steak by itself with no accompaniments. Now thats when you know you got a great steak!Spicy Crab Pasta: I love all their pastas because it is made in house daily and this pasta had the perfect amount of spice. The spaghetti nero was the right amount of salty and the crab was buttery and delicious. The only pasta I liked more so far has been the carbonara.DESSERTS:Sweet Burrata Gelato: Okay this took a little convincing from our server because when I think burrata I think cheese but it had more of a sweet cream flavor. Dont feel put off by the tomato syrup because it does not resemble tomato flavors at all. The gelato was rich and creamy and went well with our chocolate dessert.Chocolate Torta: Loved the layers of chocolate from the crunchy bottom, cake middle and creamy chocolate mousse top with a slight orange backdrop. Our server Jake was attentive, refilled our water, cleaned our table frequently, provided new silverware with each course and timed our dishes perfectly so we never felt rushed. I will continue to come often as the service has been outstanding and the food speaks for itself., Very tasty food, great service, lovely presentation. Checked out the restaurant for the first time last night and we were able to get a high top table in the bar area. Servers are wearing white jackets so its fancy like dat. We ordered the truffled garlic bread, prime beef meatballs, spicy king crab pasta, pappardelle bolognese pasta, and to top it off since it was a special occasion, the torta meringata cake which is flambeed at your table. The sauces were excellent (we got extra pomodoro for dipping because it like tomato- based crack) but my favorites were the crab pasta and the meatballs. An extra note: service was slow (some beauty pageant event was there....i guess that still a thing) and we didn complain or anything, yet the manager came over and said he was sorry for the delay and comped our bevys and the dessert! We really appreciated that level of customer service and will definitely be back (especially as wee in the neighborhood! ), The decor inside is beautiful! Great romantic spot or place to get drinks with friends, This would have been a 5 star review except we were seated 35 past our reservation time and no one was apologetic or seemed to care, so the night didnt start off on the best note. However, I will say the food was delicious and our waiter was very friendly/knowledgeable. Do not miss the truffle garlic bread and meatballs as an appetizer, both were so flavorful and amazing! We also had the eggplant parm, chicken picatta, pappardelle bolognese, and the black truffle pasta dish. I would definitely get all again but look forward to trying other dishes on the menu as well. Save room for dessert, so many great options!!, Where to start!? How about the food?! Wow, bravo, RPM! I just got back from Italy last week, and I cringe to say that the pasta at RPM was probably better than any of the pasta we had in Rome! I actually wasnt hungry at all, but my friend wanted to eat and I wasnt going to say no. Well just share a couple of things.... 5 courses later LOL... Rosemary Foccacia Bread: WOW. honestly so delicious and crunchy and soft. Get this.Shredded Brussels Sprouts Salad: This was light and delicious. Super thinly shaved Brussels, light dressing, super refreshing course. Meatballs: just ok. Im not a huge meatball fan, and just wasnt THAT impressed by these. Pasta: We ordered the carbonara, and they accidentally brought mama de pandis pomodoro. They let us keep both, and comped both, which was great. I LOVED the carbonara, was a little heavy for this time of year, but the flavors were great. We barely touched the pomodoro because legit we had too much food, but the flavor was great in the few bites i had. Service: really GREAT service, and i rarely say that. The managers roaming around the bar are super nice, helpful and accommodating. Didnt have full table service, so cant speak to that. Our bartender was super cool and chill, though I will say it took a while to get his attention for new drinks/the tab. And this was after it had emptied out. Perhaps they need to add another bartender for busy nights? The space: Very vegas vibe. Dark colors, mirrors, very sleek. The bar is in a seperate room from the dining room, which I feel like is a great idea, so it doesnt get to loud. The People: HMMMM...Ive lived in DC for 8 years and this was the first time I had a totally LA experience...bodycon dresses, crop tops, cheesy guidos! Very bridge and tunnel vibe! Not necessarily bad, but just a different situation than Im used to. DC is usually pretty laid back, and even places like Le Diplomate, youre not getting this type of crowd. But to each his own, it definitely made for some good people watching! I think because this is a new celebrity restaurant people are bringing out all the stops! But the food was great (and super reasonably priced) so Ill definetly be back!, Another great meal at RPM Italian!! Been to the Chicago location twice, so had to visit the new DC location. Great meal, great service, fantastic drinks, and phenomenal atmosphere! Headed to the bar after dinner for a few more drinks and Dave and Ladonna were fantastic!! As for them!! Will be back next time we are in DC!, 2.5 stars 3 stars for service, 2 stars for the food The restaurant is beautiful and is definitely one of the trendiest places in town right now. The AC was blasting way too high and most patrons at the bar were shivering as a result. It was hard to get the bartenders attention, but once we placed our orders, the food came out pretty fast. The tuna carpaccio and garlic bread were both good- nothing to rave about, but good nonetheless. However, both pasta entrees were too dense and my dining partner and I had to stop after a few bites. We had the Italian donuts for dessert- they were good, but definitely not as good as the ones at fiola mare. If RPM had opened up 5 years ago, before the DC dining scene really picked up, I would have loved it. However, there are so many better options at this point that I dont think I will be returning- especially after seeing a huge Sysco truck parked out in front of the restaurant!, My husband and I had a fantastic night out for his birthday on Tuesday at RPM! You know you are going to get an authentic Italian experience when your server is from Milan :) the ambiance is very posh and Im glad I wore a dress and my husband wore slacks. The servers looked very nice in their white jackets and black ties. Our server was very knowledgeable of the menu and offered great recommendations, which we appreciated. He was helpful in answering our questions. We shared a few appetizers and pastas (they arent huge - so taste a few!). The black truffle pasta was to die for. The prosciutto stuffed tortellini was also excellent. My husbands favorite was the lobster ravioli. The dessert menu is extensive, and in the end we went for the merengata (?) that they light up to toast the marshmallow, and is filled with salted caramel gelato and topped with chocolate sauce. Delicious! Next time we will try three new pastas and a new dessert :) oh, because it was my hubbys birthday the kitchen also gave us a couple little gelato scoops in mini cones with a candle and happy birthday sign! (As if we needed more calories...) All the wait staff was very professional and they paid a good level of attention to you, clearing plates, shaving fresh truffle on the pasta, setting up the dessert, pouring coffee, etc. Thanks RPM!, Amazing place! Starting from the prosseco/raspberry drink to the flaming cake! Had invited clients for dinner and it was above and beyond. The service was impeccable and our server Grace was so knowledgeable and on point!!! I think we were her first table and it would had seemed she had been there forever. Exactly what great training looks like! We got half the menu just because of her. If you go it will certainly not disappoint!, We had a fabulous evening at RPM Italian. The decor is very cool modern. We started off with an old fashioned and Rose Brute both wonderful. For antipasti we started to 600 day Prosciutto and Roman Artichokes. This took us back to one of our favorite meals in Rome! For main we had lobster ravioli and the Tuscan kale and spinach salad. The salad was light and refreshing, perfect for what I wanted to offset the heavy antipasti. I also had a glass of their house Chianti. For dessert we had the pistachio gelato and Bills Chocolate Budino. Both very good.The staff was wonderful and very attentive. Cant wait to go back and try more!, Amaze...!! Ambiance fantastic, service fantastic, drinks fantastic, food fantastic..!! Honestly dont know what to complain about. Will be returning for sure., Im so happy to finally have a delicious Italian restaurant in DC. Its about time, guys. I arrived and went to the bar to wait for my friends. I ordered a cocktail - The National. It was very, very good. At $14 it should be. Upon being seated, we had two servers - both very nice. But both were very eager - too eager. Like lingering at the table too long that I almost felt like they should be dining with us kind of lingering. To start - we went burrata strong and got the fresh burrata with peaches and burrata carrozza. The burrata was extremely fresh and tasty. Keep in mind the burrata carrazza is not a big portion, so if you have a larger group - consider ordering more than one, its worth it. For my meal, I ordered the prosciutto tortelloni. It was one of the best meals I have ever eaten. Its not a huge pasta meal, but it was a perfect portion for me. The light parmesan sauce was perfect and was so tasty.For dessert, I had the hazelnut tartufo. I prefer traditional tartufo, but this was a very interesting and rich alternative. This is a dessert that is big enough to be shared, but if you are a chocoholic like me - you can just have it all to yourself.I already made my next reservation and cant wait to come back., Great food , went with friends all of our food was delicious , desert was tasty their pistachio ice-cream was so good , will deff come back again., Everything was legit, but my favorites were the Ten Cent Pistol cocktail, the spicy king crab pasta, the carbonara, and the pistachio sorbet., This is my all-time favorite restaurant in Chicago. The DC location is a close second. They have less small plates than the Chicago location but the food and service are still five star, Wonderful experience from the service to the food. RPM is a gem and well worth the $Must try... Lobster Caprese, Lobster Ravioli, I rarely give places 5 stars but this place most definitely deserves it. The first thing you notice besides the gorgeous ambience is the CUSTOMER SERVICE. They are 100% on point. Even if the food wasnt as good as it was Id still give this place a high rating bc of the customer service. Our server (I think his name was Rasheed or ? I cant remember) was excellent. The maitred were amazing. Everyone was just perfect. The food:Truffle garlic bread was amazing. Lobster Burrata was amazingThe beet salad was bursting with flavor The artichokes were good but not my favorite thing The kale salad was yum The lobster with angel hair pasta was outstanding. I loved how spicy it wasTo top it off we had the flamb39 tart, which was the most amazing cake Ive ever had. It was a cake topped with marshmallows flamb39 table side and then drizzled with chocolate. Inside was ice cream. It was TO DIE for. I have nothing bad to say about this place and Im not easy to please. I think Ive said enough, Overall a pleasant experience. Although everything seemed over seasoned and very salty when having multiple courses. At first glance it seems expensive, but all said and done with cocktails, starter, salads, main dishes, and wine was a little over $100 per person, which is average for DC. The Spritz & Giggles kicked off the meal. This was a refreshing drink with just the right mix of ingredients. We started with the truffle garlic bread, which was prepared well. Although its serving size might have been a little too big. Then we each had a salad, the shaved Brussel sprouts, which was AMAZING. The Giuliana Italian salad was okay. It was actually too wet and soggy. Then the best part, the pasta carbonara. Absolute perfection. Creamy, favorable, just the right portion for a middle course. This dish could rival similar dishes prepared in Italy. Main dish were Lobster Diavlo and RPM Steak Grigliata. The diavlo was VERY spicy and oily. It appears they use a chili oil. The steak was extremely salty and over buttered. I wouldnt recommend this dish. Service was good, but you can see theyre still trying to work out the kinks. Multiple on floor managers ensured food and service needs were being met. Although at times there seemed to be up to four roaming around this somewhat small dining room. The space itself is beautiful. Although the bench seating is lower than the chair so two people of equal height turns into one person looking down at the other. I suggest those who are tall sit on the bench. Well go back, but maybe for lunch And have a salad and pasta., I saw that this was opened a month ago when I saw Guiliana Rancics Instagram about the opening. So, I came here with a friend during the weekday so that I didnt have to stress out about a weekend reservation. We came in and we had about 10 minutes till our reservation, so we went to the bar. We noticed that there were two open high top tables near the TV. So we inquired about whether not we could sit there instead of the main dining room. We wanted to watch the Olympics, and I know thats probably bad but its exciting time of the year and they were broadcasting some swimming and gymnastics finals. So, they were able to accommodate us and we had a TV right in front of her table.The first thing I do whenever I come to restaurant, is ask the person sitting us what their favorite dishes are. The woman said she like the RPM steak and the Bolognese. Our waiter recommended truffled garlic bread, meatballs, octopus, lobster ravioli and lobster fra diavolo and pork. We ordered:- truffle garlic bread - so crispy and good:)- Lobster ravioli - full of lobster and flavor- Bolognese - pasta was so good and so was the tender meat that accompanied it  - Hazelnuy Tartufo - to die for!- Burrata Gelato - compliments of Josh..amazing! On future visits, Id like to try the prime beef meatball, octopus, fritto misto, spicy crab pasta, carbonara, lobster fra diavolo, risotto, chocolate torta, and the torta meringata.They will soon be opening up the patio and as they hire more staff theyll eventually serve lunch.Overall, amazing flavors, excellent customer service and great staff. Thanks again Erik and Josh. Oh and I love the white jackets all the waiters wore very classic!, DC finally has a trendy Italian restaurant! This stands out from the others because its a more of a relax and fun environment. We started off with: Garlic bread, Lobster tail and Meatballs all were very delicious. For dinner: I got the lobster ravioli and my husband got pappardelle bolongese these were tasty the sauce in my ravioli had a little kick to it which made it a little spicy and I loved that. Unfortunately we had no room for dessert but will definitely be returning for that! Since it was my birthday we had got their in house churned gelato one of each flavor sweet burrata and toasted pistachio they were perfect to end the night with! I love this place and will be returning., YOU GUYS, book a table tonight. Seriously, Ill wait while you go on open table. SO good. Restaurant is very sleek with black and white decor. The booths are the round-style that make you pretend youre fancy, while still allowing conversation. Now that Im done obsessing with the look of the place, our waitress was amazing (wish I could remember her name!). She walked us through the menu and offered suggestions based on our tastes and what we were craving, not just what would bring the best tip. You can tell the restaurant places a huge focus on service. Cocktails were delish, with my bourbon, ginger, grapefruit incredibly satisfying after a hot day at work.Food came out fast and hot with table service (freshly shaved black truffle anyone?). We got a nice variety of starters (decently sized if ordered right) and a couple pasta dishes. Theyll tell you pasta is a smaller portion, yet didnt mind bc very rich and homemade. Dessert was gelato/vanilla cake for four the server douses in flames at your table. It smelled like smores and tasted like heaven.Save your pennies folks, this is worth checking out., Slam dunk dining right here! Ever since my bff (whose family is straight from Sicily, so she knows her Italian food) went to the original RPM in Chicago and raved about the experience, Ie thought how cool it would be to visit Guiliana and Bill restaurant. And then, when I heard the rumors that RPM was opening a location in DC, I got really excited. And then, the news was that it was opening THREE. BLOCKS. AWAY from my house sent me over the edge. I walked by daily like a crazy stalker wondering when oh when I would be able to visit. And then it opened. And then it was my birthday! And what a fitting place it was to come for my birthday dinner with my main squeeze. I didn know what to expect in terms of interior because the windows are always covered with dark shades. When you walk in, the covered windows make sense. It is dark, sophisticated, elegant. The bar room (on the west side) is huge and gorgeous. The main dining room is also huge and gorgeous. Everything is gorgeous! We had an 8 pm reservation on a Tuesday evening - definitely wasn thinking it would be packed. But oh boy, it was! We had to wait about 10 minutes for our table so we hit the bar and ordered our first drinks. Highly recommend the Spritz and Giggles (prosecco, raspberry, and vodka) and the bellini! Hubby was pleased with cider on tap, as well as local brews. I believe you can order the full menu in the bar room (lots of high-top tables) but we were glad to be in the main dining room. In the main dining room, EVERY table was filled, with couples, girlsnights out, business dinners, etc. The tables are kind of just a wee bit too close together (we started a conversation about desserts with the two guys seated at the table next to us) but we got over that pretty quickly. Our waiter was handsome and Italian and just perfection in terms of service. When going over the menu, he told us about similar dishes his grandmother in Italy would make. Perhaps this was all a show, but it felt authentic, and I loved it all! We ordered a few specials of the day (tuna steak and one of the pastas) as well as a few appetizers (baby zucchinis stuffed with burrata cheese, tuna bruschetta, crispy zucchini fritters). Everything - and I not kidding - was so, so good. We were a bit bummed with the size of the pasta serving, but you can tell that it is freshly made and high quality. For dessert, our charming waiter gave us complimentary mini gelato cups! So sweet. And then we ordered a chocolate torta that was HUGE and rich and had gold leaf on it and just amazing. As our waiter said, If you like chocolate, get it. In all, an excellent special occasion meal, and I can wait to go back!, I havent had a more frustrating meal in the city as far as I can remembered. Id been dying to dine in RPM since its opening especially after reading endless glowing reviews. My husband and I decided to save RPM for our final farewell dinner. Everything was off to a wonderful start - welcomed by the warm hosting staffs, wowed by the gorgeous dining space, greeted by the witty, charismatic server. Our appetizer - garlic truffle bread was out of the world - garlicky, beautifully toasted, infused with the perfect amount of truffle essence - we devoured it all in no time! Then it went downhill. As if our table was completely forgotten. After inquiring of our main entrees three times (a full hour had passed since we placed our order), we noticed our server began taking detours to avoid coming anywhere near our table. After another 15 minutes of looking around, the busboys finally brought out our orders. Spicy crab pasta, strozzapreti, truffle agnolotti, eggplant parmesan - The three pastas were fine. But my eggplant Parmesan was inedible. It was so heavily salted that I couldnt even take more than two bites. Since our server was nowhere to be found, everyone had already finished their pasta dishes before I had a chance to let our server know how inedible my dish was. Instead of sending my dish back, I asked for bread (in hopes of offsetting the saltiness of my dish). But the bread took so long to be brought out, the busboys had already taken everyones plates and my cold dish along. Instead of wasting more time waiting on another entree and ending our meal on such a sour note, we decided to perk up our stomachs with some desserts. Sweet burrata gelato, tiramisu affogato, and hazelnut tarfuto - all fine choices but honestly didnt make up for the neglect we felt waiting for and checking in on our main entrees. Overall - so many mishaps - to a point I almost didnt understand - how can it be? How can our entrees take more than an hour to prepare? How can our server leaves us in sitting in the dark? How can it be that no one has checked on us? How can I be leaving fuming in hunger on my farewell dinner? No words., This place is a little too new and needs to work out its kinks. For starters, Id make sure your menus have been proofread and confirmed with the chefs. They have a gluten free menu with items we came to find were not gluten free at all (thanks to the waiter for confirming). We also had to send back a dish for including ingredients we specifically asked to have removed from a meal (simply requested no cheese on a salad and got a salad with a mountain of shredded Parmesan).Compared to Giada in Las Vegas, the decor is much trendier and modern. Less inviting to stay longer, probably better suited for a happy hour spot than a long, relaxing dinner spot.Much better experience at Giada in comparison., Exactly what DC was missing!! Simple Italian dishes executed perfectly. On a personal note, Ive waited so long for a restaurant like this in DC - the food puts a gigantic smile on my face, and makes me dance in my seat. Overall: - extremely flavorful foods- service is great, if you have the right server (shout out to Selena!)- very cool vibe in the restaurant Notes:- my second time there the server (not Selena) wasnt 100% educated on the menu- I wish they had lasagna and cacio e pepe on their menu. hopefully soon!! - If you want to try out the bomboloni for dessert and one of the gelato-based desserts, I recommend asking the server to bring them out separately. Bomboloni is served warm and goes well with coffee. Warm desserts and cold desserts at the same time is overwhelming ... you dont want the ice cream to melt, and you dont want the donuts/coffee to cool off. On to the food... heres what Ive tried: Appetizers - prime beef meatball appetizer: can a meatball be described as silky? these are melt-in-your-mouth, super smooth, silky meatballs. - fried olives: great with an ice cold glass of beer- fried mozzarella: one of the best Ive ever had- 600 day aged prosciutto: its good, but I wish it came with some melon or something for the price point Entrees- prosciutto tortellini: divine!! punch of flavor and soul-warming- mushroom tagliatelle: this was a special at the time, I wish it was always on the menu! super light, full of flavor- carbonara: tried some of my dads - it was tasty, and he was very impressed by it - spaghetti with meatball: my sisters dish; she said it erased her bad week. the meatballs here are magic! - lobster fra diavolo: if youre a lobster fan, this will leave you speechless!! (in a good way)Dessert- bomboloni: not on the menu, its a special; if you like lightly sweet, warm pastries, order this. its fantastic! (italian donuts covered in sugar) *** I wish it came with warm chocolate sauce too*** - sweet burrata gelato: be adventurous and try this; its delicious flavor of ice cream (slightly tastes like cheesecake)- hazelnut tartufo: if you like Ferrero Rocher chocolates, this is your version of heaven. hazelnut ice cream with a chocolate center, covered in chocolate and chopped hazelnuts., Dined there early on a Friday night. They have an amazing menu and the food is impeccable. The decor was a little over the top and I felt very out of place wearing my casual Friday office wear. The service was also a little overwhelming, between the server and the bussers starting a lot of conversation, mixing our pasta, moving silverware around. I understand that we were one of the first tables sat so there were not many patrons to take care of, but it was too much and made us feel rushed. I have Celiac disease so it was a real treat to be able to eat safely. I ate the octopus and garbanzo bean starter which was perfectly warm, creamy and tender. I had the gluten free carbonara pasta, which was so rich I could barely finish the small portion. The only small problem with the dish was that the pasta was over cooked, but I was so happy they had gluten free pasta I hardly cared. It very difficult to get it right, so I sympathetic.My boyfriend almost cried real tears of joy over the meatball starter saying they melted in his mouth. He also had the garlic bread, the carbonara and the short rib bolognese. He was so impressed with the old world taste of the food, and confused by paired decor of the place.We are excited to come back!, The lady and I dined at the RPM in Chicago. Excellent there and excellent here. This place outshines its predecessor. Better execution, better staffing and overall brings a more refined dining experience., Chicken Parmesan was delish, I ordered with a side of pasta and sauce. Everything was seasoned well and cooked to perfection. Decor and ambience was really nice and the wait staff were knowledgeable. We had a picky eater in our group and he was patient with her..Next time Im visit DC I plan on returning here. 4.5, Very simple and fresh dishes!! The staff was amazing. The prices to me were reasonable for the location and the type of upscale restaurant it was. Forgot to take pictures of the food but it was very good. I did order the garlic whipped potatoes and on the menu it didnt mention having blue cheese and it was to my liking. Very over powering taste for me., They seem to be over their new place on the block jitters and are now running like a champ. Service staff were well informed and cheerful (Thanks Tyler for taking good care of us) Ordered the Foccacia ( enormous slices ) first, with an Italian Salad to split. Both were fresh, well made, and delicious. My Daughter had Picatta Moderna and I had the Pappardelle, a wide noodle dish with short ribs. A word to the wise: do not accept the offer for additional Parmesian as the dishes we received were perfectly seasoned as is. Any more and it overkill.Dessert choices were an Italian Cheesecake and for me a Chocolate Orange Torta. Another Pro Tip: These are not single serving desserts but shareable treats. The extra long spoons they provide should have been the first sign that we over ordered. Espresso to finish things off, and on our way we went, well fed and equally well served. Only recommendation is for the allergen info to be better known to all staff. Example - The Coconut Gelato has a peanut component to it (odd...) No matter what your allergy may be, a quick list of what in what would save some time and confusion in the meal ordering process.A superb experience and one we hope to repeat when next time in town, We couldnt wait to try RPM! From the moment we entered until we left, we felt welcomed and satisfied. And valet parking at $12 was a bargain in D.C. The decor is contemporary and clean and gorgeous. We were a party of 6 and were seated in one of the smaller, quieter rooms, which was conducive to conversation. One of the members of our party required a gluten free meal and was impressed with the separate gluten free menu. Lots of tasty choices.  Cocktails were delicious and refreshing on this hot and humid August evening. I had a Spritz and Giggles and my friend enjoyed her Cucumber Cup. For appetizers we ordered arancini, tomatoes and watermelon, and roasted beets and truffles. We ordered the shredded Brussel sprouts because of the positive reviews and were pleased. Of course we shared and had no complaints.The truffled garlic bread was simply delicious and I still dream about it. The rosemary focaccia also was tasty. Pastas are house made daily. My Maine lobster ravioli was yummy. My dinner mates had ordered spicy king crab and spaghetti, strozzapreti, eggplant parm, short rib brasato and chicken parm. My husband, who is fussy and critical, said the eggplant parm was the best he has ever tasted. We were so pleased with our entrees. We exchanged bites. No leftovers. The desserts of chocolate torta and Prosecco and grapefruit granita were tasty, but the star of the show was RPMs signature dessert torta meringata, which was flambeed at the table. Truly beautiful and scrumptious! Kudos to the owners and attentive staff for providing a memorable evening. A special thank you to Jeff for the kitchen tour and executive chef Gabe Thompson. A job well done!, In short: if you want to grab some Italian and you happen to be nearby, go here. Sit at the bar and try the Carbonara. If you want a girlie drink, try the Spritz & Giggles (it was quite delish).Why the bar, you ask? You dont want to deal with the snooty-assed hostess who think shes above you (as if... youre a hostess at a restaurant after all). If we went through the effort of making reservations, why are you going to ask us if we want to dine at the bar when you tell us that the wait is 5-10 mins? -- It turned out to be about 20 mins, which is strange because OpenTable had AVAILABILITY for EVERY single time slot on Sunday. This place seems very touristy as there were a lot of poorly dressed individuals sitting around in a swankily-decorated restaurant as pointed out by my S/O. Try the handmade pastas. The Carbonara was excellent. There were bits of crunchy pancetta and they add an egg yolk to top it off. The sauce was creamy -- but not overly salty like a lot of restaurants -- and the pasta was perfectly al dente. Also, try the truffle garlic bread. It was a very good starter!, Loved my experience here last evening! Miguel our waiter was awesome and explained each dish carefully and honestly. We had the meatballs, the truffle garlic bread and Italian salad to start - each was delish! We had the spicy crab pasta and the pork dish and we enjoyed both! Cant wait to come back here and try more things!, The food was amazing, the service was amazing, and even the restaurant itself looked amazing! Definitely going back!, Everything was amazing. I didnt know what to expect going in, considering the mixed reviews about service, but everything was fantastic. Portions were great. We had the 600-day prosciutto and garlic bread to start. Enough for four, but we (two) finished it just fine (we came prepared). Our main courses, Strozzapreti and Pappardelle Bolognese were absolutely perfect. Ive honestly never had a pasta dish with such perfectly cooked pasta. Al dente to perfection. The portions are a comfortable size. Personally, I usually eat until Im uncomfortable, and then I eat just a bit more, but these portions sizes were big enough where I was full but able to get a dessert. For dessert we got a Rum Baba and a Marscapone Cheesecake. Both were incredible. We didnt quite finish them, but the cheesecake travels well and we brought it home with us.  Service was great. Tyler M. (90% sure thats correct) was super nice and outgoing. He gave us our needed time but was there when we were ready. The place was packed so it wasnt like he was standing in the corner waiting, either.  Overall the place is great. Awesome for a group or even a special night out with the significant other. Must try, definitely recommend!, My friend and I visited the restaurant last night. We were blown away by the ambiance, the food, presentation and the service ! We love eating out in DC and have been to the best of the best. From mini bar to Zengo. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience at RPM and I will be bringing more people back visiting in town. Our waiter was wonderful also :). Wonderful to see this location is a success!, Food is quite delicious! Ambiance is classy, sexy, hip. Wait staff are all professional and attentive, but a bit quick to remove plates containing uneaten food without asking (thats a pet peeve of mine with many restaurants). The cocktails are excellent. Its quite pricey. We sat in the bar area which is done up in dark colors while deep house vibes are piped in over speakers. Luckily, the volume is low enough to allow for conversations without having to shout at your companions., Great atmosphere, very elegant interior design, food is amazingly good. We ordered the garlic bread, parmesan chicken, strozzapreti. This is my first time dining there, menu has a lot of delicious dishes and I intend to come again to explore what they have!! Its a must try, you will love itOh and I saw Drake there the night before his concert in Verizon Center, they took him to a private dining room in the back :), Blown away! My fianc39 and I had dinner here this evening. The service was amazing, but the food was even better. Everything was cooked to perfection! The melt in your mouth meatballs rivaled my Italian grandmother, the truffle garlic bread was the perfect balance of soft and crunchy, but the veal chop was to die for. Ryan, the manager, really went out of his way to make sure we had the most pleasurable dining experience. Many thanks!!, Terrible service at the bar. Bartender could not keep track of the tab and got indignant with me. Other bartender was just rude., Had a great birthday dinner at RPM last night. The restaurant ambiance and decor was perfect so I just assumed the food would not be at that level (sadly some great looking restaurants have so-so food) but to my surprise the food was excellent! Had the lobster ravioli with the order of truffle bread and so tasty and flavorful. I lived in Rome so most Italian restaurants disappoint me but RPM had very authentic flavors.Enzo who was not our waiter was super great and had to get his name so we can be seated in his section next time, so personable and just a genuinely nice guy.Looking forward to next time!, Birthday dinner. Saturday night running 15 mins behind on reservations but that was fine. Got a chance to have drink in bar area - awesome vibe I there and friendly bartenders. Not pretentious at all. Menu is short but well rounded. Wine is good and food all great except fish was just OK. Burrata and Roman artichokes were top notch apps. Service mediocre. Its loud and Im not deaf - but he basically mumbled and we had to ask for thugs I be repeated every time he spoke., 4.5 stars! Went to RPM Italian last night with my husband for the first time and really enjoyed it. We arrived around 6pm on a Sunday and decided to eat at the bar. The bar and the restaurant are actually separated - the bar is on the right and the restaurant is on the left, which is interesting - I wonder if that to keep the noise in the dining room low(er)? There were lots of bar tables in addition to the bar. It a very nice bar - black and white with a nice white marble bartop - very sleek. The music was definitely on the more trendy side and a little loud (but not enough to bother me) - definitely felt like a see and be seen place - even on a Sunday when the bar was only 1/4 full, youe not having a quiet dinner here. It a huge bar, though, which is nice. The bartender told us that it gets packed on Saturdays (and I assume Fridays too), so we definitely picked a good time for our first visit.Small list of wines by the glass - most were in the $12-18 range, although I did see a few over $20, which I thought was a little steep. I got a nice Italian white and my husband got a nice Barbera, both under $15, which was fine with me. We opened the menu and there were SO many good things that we saw - we definitely had a tough time choosing, so we tried to pick the dishes with the most seasonal ingredients. To start, I ordered the burrata with white peaches and olive oil and my husband ordered the octopus. The burrata was so fresh and actually room temperature, which increased its creaminess. The octopus was prepared beautifully and I loved the chickpeas accompaniment.Pasta was where things got tougher. RPM has about 8-10 pasta dishes (about 3/4 are seasonal and rotate based on ingredients). My husband and I debated between a few and I settled on the sweet corn stuffed pasta with summer truffles and mascarpone and he ordered the short rib ragu. When the dishes arrived, they were smaller than I expected, but this, to me, is actually a good thing because we were able to finish both dishes, and believe me, they were so rich and delicious, the portions were plenty! But I do like that they aren oversized - if youe hungry, you can probably get a 3rd dish and split it, but others expecting big bowls of pasta might be disappointed. The sweet corn pasta was wonderful and I loved the summer truffle accompaniment, and my husband short rib pasta was so tender, he barely needed his knife. Both pastas were a perfect al dente. We like that RPM offers more raditionalItalian dishes, like chicken Parmesan and spaghetti and meatballs, too. While DC is getting a huge influx of (good!) Italian restaurants, it nice to see the basics on a menu, and based on our experience, I willing to bet they are darn good.Why not 5 stars? I wish they didn charge for bread. I understand that the bread is way beyond the typical bread with olive oil, with house-baked specialty breads and spreads, but it an Italian restaurant - a basic ciabatta with a little olive oil would be a nice touch. When I asked my husband if he come back, he said in a heartbeat AND said he might like it better than some of the other italian places wee been frequenting - if nothing else, for a selection of 8-10 different pastas each night., Dined at RPM for the first time recently and really enjoyed it! My fianc39 and I stopped in for dinner on Friday night around 5:30 so we were able to take advantage of the happy hour specials. Our server went above and beyond to assure that we had a pleasant dining experience and we never felt rushed during our meal (also never felt like we were being ignored). The food exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be dining at RPM again soon., Absolutely fantastic! Ie been sending hints to my husband since the day RPM opened. When we happened to walk by Mount Vernon Square, I would attempt to take a peek inside. The place is all covered so no luck. But the curiosity ended when my hubby took me here for my birthday dinner! The style of Italian plates are almost like something whipped out of Giada De Laurentiiskitchen. It classic Italian, moderate portions and elegant presentation. Everything that touched my palate was so very good! Imported Barrata - Antipasta spin on caprese. The peaches and basil were so fresh. The barrata and olive oil were so delicious as I scooped every ounce with the thick slices of fresh bread. Maybe the olive oil was imported too but I think $18 is a bit pricey for such a dish? No? Mediterranean Octopus - Octopus cooked and seared perfectly! It was super tender and super delicious with the chick peas and hummus. The celery really added a nice crunch and flavor to the overall dish. Carbonara - This dish is elevated with a few sprinkles of freshly grated parmesan. There saltiness from the pancetta, creaminess from the egg yolk, and nice bites from the noodles cooked perfectly al dente!Amalfi Frutti Di Mare - My favorite dish of the night with fresh crab meat, lobster and clams and bell-shaped pasta (my name for it). Our server said this pasta has different names, depending on the region in Italy. I could taste fresh olive oil, fresh lemon, chili oil, red pepper flakes, and peppercorn in every bite. It was the perfect amount of spiciness for such a delicate pasta dish.The mood is modern, trendy and vibrant. The dining side was packed on a Monday evening. There were even parties who sat at the bar until a table was available. Don get fooled by the available slots on open table because they will get filled quickly. The hostesses and servers were so warm and inviting. Our server was Italian, true Italian, with an accent! He was familiar with the menu and had recommendations. We even had other servers attend to us and it felt like everyone was our server!I so in love with this place that I counting the days when I can return!, SIMPLY AMAZING! My husband treated me to this amazing restaurant for my 30th birthday on Monday, August 29th. We had heard so much about it from family that had already dined that I was just dying to go! Let me first say that from the moment we entered until we left, we received STELLAR service. Everyone was extremely attentive and our waiter, Kyle, was phenomenal. I appreciate the fact that he gave us a full run down of the menu and made suggestions to fit my hubbys rather picky needs. You would have thought that Kyle had been working at RPM forever! Thank you KYLE!Now on to the FOOD. WOWZERS. SO friggin good. I appreciate that the entrees are a perfect portion and the sauces arent too rich and heavy. I started with the Meatballs...they are all beef...no pork and so tender. A must have! Pairing that with the Garlic Truffle toast was divine. Then I had the Lobster Ravioli and it was SO YUMMY. If you dont get an appetizer, I would recommend adding a side item or a salad. My husband had the Amalfi Seafood Pasta and that was also delicious. I had to have a few bites lol! The cocktails are also great, I cant remember the name of the one I had but it had pineapple flavoring! Dessert...the donuts are to die for. I cant wait to go back to RPM! So glad to have this gem in DC!, I came here with a friend for happy hour and was expecting a cool decor/vibe but mediocre food. I was pleasantly surprised! As an Italian-American, I am usually critical of Italian food at restaurants, and even more suspicious when its a celebrity-owned restaurant. Girlfriend (Guilana Rancic for the uneducated) didnt let me down. The food was fresh, delicious, and fairly authentic. My friend (another girl) and I ordered the pomodoro, the arancini Milanese and a pizza and this was plenty for both of us. I also had the Spritz and Giggles drink which was delish. The service was also great!
61|sallys-middle-name-washington|Great, fresh food. All the food was great, but the standouts were the smoked duck, the salad that came with the duck, and lamb pancetta green beans. Simple, fresh, creative fare and a welcome addition to H St. The menu supposedly changes based on what is fresh/available. They are getting their liquor license soon, but at present there are no adult beverages, so plan accordingly, for now. Only negative was that the food came out a bit too quickly and so the dinner was less leisurely than I would typically like. But overall service was great, especially for a restaurant that just opened., My wife and I came here for a date night after meeting the owners a few weeks prior and reading about it in the Thrillist. As neighbors to H Street, we love to support local new restaurants.Wed give it a solid 5 star rating. The space is beautiful with the kitchen out in the open for all to see. The food was amazing. A few highlights: Swiss chard with smoked bacon, soy marinated egg with fried garlic and ginger, and new bay chicken (the bone is still in FYI). We think they are waiting for their liquor license because they didnt serve alcohol, but the non-alcoholic rhubarb shrub was so refreshing. Lets hope they turn that one into a cocktail soon!The only feedback we had was the service. It was a bit intense at first and then went silent half way through. Highly recommend this place and we hope the fact that only a handful of people were there on a Thursday night doesnt put them out of business. We want them to stay!, This place is amazing. Ie never looked at a radish and thought looks good - Il eat that until my girlfriend ordered the radishes with a radish top pesto. It easily made it into my top 10 bites of food ever. Other stand outs from dinner were the chicken thigh (with an amazing green sauce that made the aforementioned girlfriend embarrassed when I licked the plate) and the smoked duck. Everything we had was extremely fresh, perfectly cooked, and absolutely delicious. The atmosphere was fun and light. The plates made it feel like home. The wait staff was terrific. The chef even came over and told us how to make that green sauce.No beer, wine or cocktails yet, but the food was so good we didn miss them.I will definitely be going back., FIVE STARS ABSOLUTELY! The food is interesting and delicious and comforting. Soul food for the foodie. The staff is friendly and knowledgable about the food (despite the menu changing every single day based on what ingredients they receive from their farm partners). We have had Ryan as our waiter both times and he has been awesome. Treats us like friends, educates us on the ingredients we arent familiar with without making us feel dumb, and hes very attentive but not overly so. The chefs know what theyre doing and they clearly do it with heart. Aphra, the co-owner with her chef hubby, is so sweet and made multiple trips to our table to make us feel welcome and even asked our opinion. Lastly, the vibe has an upscale diner feel - shabby chic dish ware and napkins (that Aphra made herself!!!), exposed brick, green floral arrangements, and pseudo-1950s retro diner stools set up around the kitchen counter for an up close view of the kitchen. We are proud to have Sallys Middle Name in our neighborhood!, Such a gem of a place! The food was excellent and the staff was extremely nice., Such an inventive menu! We got several dishes to share and each one was unique and fantastic. The corned beef was so flavorful. The grilled romaine, which or waiter suggested was also amazing. Good service, good music and good acoustics. I will DEFINITELY be back., An incredible meal with fantastic service. My wife and I loved the anchovy green beans, the grilled romain was out of this world good, and the pork shoulder is to die for! Plus all tax and tip is included in the price. Definitely going here again!, There are just two ridiculous problems holding this place back. First - the BEERS are a complete rip-off! They charge regular DC prices (expensive) for beers and they have the AUDACITY to serve little tiny cups of beer, maybe 8 ounces. Half the beer youd get anywhere else.Second, just how tone-deaf are they to insist on adding an automatic built-in gratuity?? Do they really expect the clientele of a place like this wouldnt tip?? I mean theyre just unnecessarily irritating people and insulting their customers.That said, the food was good. If they would just correct these two very easy fixes theyd be so much better. Im still mad at myself that we just didnt send those little shot glass sized beers back though., Love this place! Service is friendly and genuine - not fake. Freshest food Ive ever tasted. Wonderful experience overall. Pork croquette was a balanced blast of multiple flavors and textures. Best beets and peas Ive ever had the pleasure of tasting. My whole party left feeling deeply nourished and satisfied. Our new favorite place to eat! In sum, if I were to have a last meal, Id want it to be from here., I recently tried this place for dinner with 3 girlfriends. It tiny and it took some maneuvering to fit in my seat squeezed in behind another table. The menu is written on the wall and the wait staff is really friendly when explaining everything (which they have to do as it non-traditional). I should have thought it odd when the waiter said, You could order the entire menu to share and it wouldn be too much food. So the portions are small. And the prices are high. That said, the food is really good. I would eat the pork croquette every day. It was hands-down my favorite. Other orders... - lamb poutine - though I didn taste it, my friends said it was kind of bland- grilled romaine - SO good! Get it with the pork croquette.- beet salad - good but nothing to write home about though the fresh spring peas were a nice touch - corn & tomato salad - good but nothing to write home about - pork croquette - did I mention this? It awesome. We also ended with the homemade black raspberry ice cream and chocolate sauce. Do it. Get it. So creamy and delicious. So yes, expensive (note: gratuity is included), but a unique restaurant to try some really fresh dishes, including the pork croquette., Sallys Middle Name is a must. Everything we ordered (most of it based on our server Ariels recommendation) impressed The Gazpacho, Apricot and Tomato Salad were fantastic. They perfectly accompanied the Roasted Halibut with peach romesco complemented by Minervois Rose. Hopefully when you go they will have the blackberry pie and olive oil cake. Best desserts I have had in a long time., The food is fantastic. I wouldnt be surprised if awards started rolling in. I will definitely go back-- the food was just so so so phenomenal. The ambiance was nice-- the menu is written on the wall to highlighting the freshness of the menu. They did a good job converting the space from the previous tenants. My only complaint is the alcohol--- the beers were $8 but they were in small/ half pint glasses. The wine was also $8/$9 AND it was basically the same pour as the beer. So skip the beer-- get the wine.Oh also note gratuity is already included., I appreciate what they are trying to do at their core. Good food, small plates, engaged & informed staff... should be a recipe for top restaurant. They prominently broadcast no need to tip... Love that the employees are paid fairly by the employer. For this reason and the talent in the kitchen (and others) I really wanted to love the place. But for me some of the other stuff came across as gimicky and pretentious... And it distracted/detracted from our overall experience. Menu on the wall is trendy, but it makes collaborative ordering more cumbersome than it needed to be... Which is not ideal for a bite & pass small plate place. It was also not ideal being the table parked directly underneath the menu because we constantly had people directing stares in our direction and convening in our proximity to organize their order... Not a huge deal ... But something that was distracting. Water was served in mini glasses, poured 1/3 full so server had to come to refresh constantly (90+ degrees out that day), which broke conversation. Alone, not a huge problem... But distracting. Onto the food:Went with 2 friends (both of which appreciate food)... Ordered pretty much everything on the menu... Most things were creative and knock your socks off great... Others fell a bit short of (very high) expectations (but nothing was bad). We love the small plate format, but there were several dishes that didn have 3 meaningful bites on them for us to share... Overall, the 3 of us spent a little over 120 dollars (no drinks), and we had to make a sandwich later that night. Il definitely go back... Because I REALLY want to love it here., JUST GO! This food is amazing! When we walked in and saw the menu board, nothing jumped out but we decided to give it a shot because we are familiar with the chef and know his food is top notch. Best decision ever. We watched two couples walk in, look at the board and leave. Bad move guys.We had the new bay chicken thigh, wax beans with anchovy paste, elote, tomato and corn salad, mashed potatoes with rabbit gravy and the sour cherry tart. EVERY SINGLE DISH was interesting, complex, memorable and ridiculously delicious! And the service was great. Sallys Middle Name is now one of my favorite restaurants. We will definitely be regulars., really great place. the food was comforting, yet with a gourmet twist. i had the pork croquettes, the apricot salad, the lamb poutine, and the sweet corn beignets. the space was cozy, intimate, and no frills attached. the staff was super helpful and friendly. gotta go back and try their brunch. would highly recommend!, I really like this place! I walked in after seeing some cool items on the menu (though the menu changes regularly and they were no longer available when I arrived). The place has a cool vibe, and serves small plates of local/fresh food. We just had dessert (house-made blueberry and corn (goat milk) ice cream) and drinks. They dont serve anything with liquor but did have a small but interesting collection of beer, wine, and mead. The owners are awesome, and the staff is friendly. Will be back soon to try dinner with an updated review!, Sallys Middle Name is a fantastic new restaurant in the Atlas District. The format is small plates and changes daily so consider visiting with two or three friends and ordering the entire menu to share. You will not be disappointed. We have been for brunch once and dinner several times and have been granted revelatory food experiences on each visit. The service is exemplary, knowledgeable and warm while totally exempt from irritating fakeness: A gratuity of 18% is included one the check and this service charge is shared between all employees in the front and back of the house. This civilized approach is appears to lead to both happy employees and patrons. Do yourself a favor and check out Sallys soon and often., Two things have to change. First, portions are far smaller than pricing and descriptions suggest. Second, THE DREADED AUTOGRAT.I get the whole small plate thing, but when you order a $13 chicken and biscuits for brunch, you expect more than two chicken wings and a small biscuit. Not chicken legs. Chicken wings. I wish I was kidding. The goat hash was similarly disappointing. $8 to upgrade their home fries with a minuscule amount of goat and a poached egg ($12 total). $10 for a half a glass of prosecco and a splash of orange juice. I will tell say they are strategically placed near a number of other restaurants for when your hunger hits, immediately after leaving. Three of us had a total of three drinks and a few small plates. For this, we walked away $100 lighter (and directly into Impala). Bigger issue: The whole service included schtick? An autograt of 18% does not count as service included. All that says is you don trust your customers to tip. I was ok with the inflated prices when I thought you were actually including additional labor costs, but now I feel scammed. Let me be clear: I am very much in favor of a living wage for service industry employees, and appreciate those businesses that have actually transitioned to an inclusive pricing model. This is NOT the same thing (and to the reviewer trying to shame those of us pointing this out, GFY). I had high expectations for Sally. I live around the corner and had been trying to convince friends to go with me since the opening. And actually, the little food you receive is good. The small amount of chicken I received was excellent, and the dinner menu appeared promising. The eggs were cooked well, the potatoes were perfect, and the SLT looked delicious. I want to like this place. Hopefully they get it together on portions, prices, and the half-baked gratuity scheme., Nothing out of the ordinary except for the prices., This place had a LOT of promise. Creative atmosphere - no menus, just a dry erase marker and a wall! - interesting dishes - beets with pickled mustard seeds and basil! And at first it seemed like the place might pull it off. For example, the roasted squash dish was out of this world. But it was ultimately disappointing for two reasons.First, the prices in relation to the size of the dishes, which are tiny. You cannot charge $17 for a piece of salmon that definitely smaller a deck of cards. Period. I guess you can, if the dish is the best thing youe ever had -- and it very tasty, but it not at that level.Second -- and this is why I giving this place 2 stars and not 3 -- the policy on tipping is seriously misleading. When we went in, the wall said NO NEED TO TIP - EVERYTHING IS INCLUDED in caps like that -- or something pretty close to it. To me, that seems to say our prices may seem high, but our plate prices already include tax and tip, so don worry. And when we read that, we though oh okay, that why the small plate salmon costs $17. Then the bill came to our table and we realized that EVERYTHING IS INCLUDED actually means WE AUTOMATICALLY ADD A NON-NEGOTIABLE 18% TIP TO EVERY BILL. And no, tax wasn included either. Big difference.Anyways, if the dishes grow a bit - and if the tip policy is clarified - this place will be worth a visit. For now, they still need to work out the kinks and pricing., Sallys is amazing!!!! Definitely a top 5 restaurant in the DMV area! The roasted sunchokes and shaved broccoli were our picks of the evening, but dont expect them to be on the menu when you arrive as the menu changes daily! We really like that the owners are present and committed to a quality eating and dining experience. We learned that the head chef has spent his entire career in and around kitchens since the age of 16 - its apparent in the taste of the food. We also learned that nearly everyone, including the manager is trained as a chef. This business DESERVES your patronage., We had the exact same experience as the poster Matt below. 5 pp who live in the neighborhood walk in to an empty restaurant at 9:30 pm on a Saturday and the staff refuses to seat us, because there is only one table in the restaurant where they will seat five. We were genuinely confused by the policy, as anyone with eyes could see plenty of solutions sitting before us. When we talked to the manager, who as far as I can tell has no understanding of what it means to manage anything, he said that they had decided to only have one table where they would seat five it would look funny to pull two empty tables together or let someone sit on the edge of a four top. We were extremely polite and sincerely having a hard time understanding what is clearly needless inflexibility, and the worst part was this dude complete and total IDGAF response--literally shrugging his shoulders and saying nothing rather than offering an apology or trying to encourage us to stay at the bar or anything. After seeing the review below, perhaps his apathy is a result of having this conversation time and time again. So...to the restaurant owners: how many more potential regular customers and neighbors are you going to alienate and turn into active detractors before you value customer service over aesthetics?, You should order every veggie dish on the menu at Sallys! The carrots, bean sprouts and carrot tops this evening are ridiculous. And a Wildflower Mead from Charm City to wash it down? Get out of here!, Ive been to Sallys for dinner & brunch and have had delicious experiences both times. The food is impeccably prepared by Sam and his team. I love going back and seeing the menu continually change and evolve. For brunch my friends and I started with the Apple Cider Donuts - highly recommended (hurry in as the menu changes regularly!). The lamb hash was incredible - the meat was seasoned perfectly and the dish as a whole encompassed all I could ask for in a breakfast meal. I snuck a bite of bacon from a friends plate - only making me jealous I hadnt ordered it for myself. If youre looking for a spot to bring out of town visitors or just want a meal out knowing itll be incredible overtime Sallys, I tried the pork shoulder sandwich when Sallys Middle Name was at Parcel Market instead of Maketto this past weekend. The $10 sandwich lived up to its hype about keeping me warm but it was messy to eat. I ended up grabbing napkins from Carving Room., Super happy with everything Ive had here. Lovely, friendly staff.The small plates are not as small as you might expect, especially for brunch. You can be completely full from home fries and eggs for $10. Ask for their hot sauce!, Excellent restaurant. Most things are very delicious. Its rather casual, with plain tables and a laid-back atmosphere, but the food is high quality. Limited choices, refreshed every day and written on the wall. I would recommend studying the wall as youre waiting to be seated. Its a bit confusing at first but in the end its fine. A fun spot for a meal., This weird little building used to house a bad pizza place. Now it serves a handful of smallish main dishes each night that patrons mix and match to maya meal. The sweet potato, squash spaghetti and roasted broccoli were all fantastic. Too bad its hard to read the wall menu unless you are positioned right. And oh the drink menu is very limited- only three types beer and wine. Be sure to savor the pretty eclectic china. Oh and Sally is apparently the owners sister., Sallys Middle Name is a very welcome addition to the H Street Corridor, which remains in need of a whole set of high quality dining options, but is heading in the right direction with Ocopa, Maketto and now, Sallys Middle Name (in addition to the long-standing great Toki). On my first trip there, I was impressed by the relaxed atmosphere and welcoming service that was relaxed and informative. A mix of 5 small plates was a perfect amount of food for our party of two, and I particularly enjoyed the Rabbit Liver Pate, salad and pork loin. The wines by the glass were also fantastic. And if the apple cider doughnut is available, definitely dont leave without trying., Ie been hearing the fuss buzzing around about Sally Middle Name the past few months, and waited for an opportunity to make a trip there happen. Finally, the chance came and a group of four of us went to check it out for dinner. The interior is minimal yet cozy at the same time, though it a bit awkward to crane your neck to read the menus written on the walls (and awkward if you happen to be sitting under the menu). I much prefer paper menus so I can look at it at my leisure, and one of my dining companions with poor eyesight agreed. The menu is not extensive, though it pretty much comprised of all dishes you can envision and ingredients that will be well known. The food was delicious, though I will say not nearly as inventive as I had hoped they would be. As a disclaimer, I have to put out there that Ie been over the small plates at a restaurant format for a while now. That said, there are some places who do it well (for example, Nido). Sally Middle Name, however, falls a little short on portion sizes if youe dining with more than 2 people. This is especially true with some of the dishes with economical ingredients (potatoes, salad, etc.). Also, sharing soup just doesn work! If you go with 4 people, you can literally just choose one of each dish and youl get a dinner worth of food (which is pretty much what we did). Currently they are not serving spirits (soon to come). The shrub was delicious, however., Sally middle name. What is it? Do they ever tell you? I never found out. I need to know.It a cute little breakfast spot on H street. It has the charm of one of the bistro type places you see your favorite characters on TV sit and enjoy a serious chat at, but no, it just a restaurant that takes a long time to cook you eggs.Albeit the eggs were good, but lemme break it down for you:The day I left DC my friends thought it would be nice if we had breakfast before I left. We got to SMN and immediately were seated. There were only two other occupied tables. We came in sporadically because of parking issues and the server came around sporadically as well. Everyone was at the table (mind you it was four people), we waited patiently for our waitress to arrive. Five minutes or so she comes back and we order.I get the eggs, bacon and potatoes ( all a la carte). I ask, what kind of toast do you have?She replied, oh we don serve toast here.How do you label yourself a breakfast spot if you don have toast? How do you eat eggs without toast, a bagel, English muffin, anything! Il take a gluten free slice of toast at this point.Defeated, I ordered their apple cider donut. I needed something!I swear to you we waited 40-45 minutes for breakfast. For eggs. Eggs man. Now this place is a little hipstery, a little uppity so maybe that the thing? Eggs take a long time because they are cool eggs- like the Fonz or something...Let me say this. The food was good. The donut was delicious. That being said. I could have gone to IHOP and saved $10 and saved an hour almost of my life. Just because you serve items on what looks like plates you found at Antique Roadshow, it doesn mean I have to bear the brunt of the cost. The fancy tea pot is cool, but I totally fine with a mug and a tea bag.It a cute place. The food is good, but definitely over priced for what youe getting and please, please do not go here if youe in a rush or have immediate plans because you will be late to them- guarantee., Came here on a friday night on a friends recommendation. We had a reservation and were seated right away. The place has a very hip yet friendly vibe, and while our table was near the bar and it was crowded, it didnt feel uncomfortable. Service was excellent. We ordered several small plates and enjoyed them all- especially the duck poutine and the beet ice cream. My one critique is that several dishes were a bit too heavily salted. And the while written wall menu is cute, its hard to see from every seat, especially when people are standing in front of it. Its a small menu and they ran out a few things while we were there- so dont get your hopes up too much for something particular! Overall this is a great lively And intimate place for a date or to catch up with friends!, Very hipster little spot, cute decor and ambiance. Menu is written on wall instead of printed, interesting menu options. Food was nothing beyond average, if anything overpriced for what it was. Cute concept, but I probably wouldnt go back for more., On the recommendation of more than one foodie friend, we finally had a chance to try out Sallys Middle Name. The space has a hip Brooklyn feel - mis-matched vintage plates, white subway tile, cozy bar, and tons of amazing cookbooks for patrons to peruse while considering the handwritten daily specials on the wall.My husband is vegan so our server (who happened to be co-owner as well) was super accommodating and let us know the chef could prepare 2-3 dishes without meat or dairy. We started with the marinated olives - a delicious mix of olive varieties - and some toasted rosemary bread. Highlights of our meal included a dish of colorful, perfectly cooked beets and a bowl of some of the most amazingly flavorful fried rice Ive ever had (and Ive had a lot of fried rice). The Butterhead Salad with yuzu marinated beets was also delicious - fresh, citrusy, and crisp. As a non-vegan myself, I found the entire meal delicious and satisfying. Had there been some vegetarian protein, this would have pushed us above and beyond our already very positive review.Well definitely be back again. So nice to know Sallys Middle Name is in the neighborhood!, Like the H Street Corridor it serves, it is young, hip, and inventive. The nights menu is written out on a huge chalkboard on one wall and dry erase marker on white tile on the other, both easy to read and quick to update. We started with sunchokes/ roasted apples/ bacon and perfect sauce, butter lettuce/ yuzu marinated beets with kewpie dressing, 2x the Freekeh soup with veal meatballs and Baharat spices (superb), chicken breast under Mole, perfectly cooked with great mole, just spicy enough not to get in the way. I liked that the six dishes were brought in 3 waves. Upshot: they have mastered the art of blending tastes to make sauces that improve already great food. The spices used are multi-continent, cross-cuisine, and harmonic; like a bunch of notes that when played together make a cool-sounding chord. We look forward to going back to try more of what was on the menu., Sunday, 6:00 PM.Quickie:+ Food quality+ Hygiene+ Customer service- Turnaround- Menu variety+ Hip n chill vibeAnd then...?Sallys Middle Name is a good place to share food. Be prepared to order a lot (portions are small for this phatty) if youre coming as a group. **********Stuffed my face in:1. Pork hash with a poached egg + Hash has a savory flavor cut by the runny yolk. 2. Duck egg in a nest - Banal texture and aroma. 3. Fried chicken lunch + Nice crisp, kept the grease in check. 4. Frittata with goat cheese, fingerling potatoes + Consistent texture, each ingredient had a clear profile. 5. Hot sauce + Uses spice for flavor not to blunt taste buds. Constructive comments:*Do you compost?*Source ingredients, Another great night at Sallys. The pappardelle with lamb ragu was marvelous, but I am hear to talk about the turnips. In green curry and on rice. When it went into my mouth, it was a changeling of taste. First, spice of the curry, then sweet, then more subtle burn. It was wonderful. So good., This may have been the most frustrating dining experience Ie had in DC. Portions are way too small for the price, and the confusing don tip policy is misleading (they automatically add 18% service charge). Still, the food was great, which is why this place gets two stars instead of one.I went with a large group for dinner. The upstairs room was reserved and each person paid $45 for what they were told would be a five course meal, not including service charge or drinks. The drink menu included about seven choices -- $7 for beer and $10-$11 for wine. Despite the normal beer prices, the glasses they used were about 8 oz and looked like a normal beer glass had been cut in half. They use the same glasses for water and wine.First course was a sweet potato with some sort of spicy mayo. I guessing because at no point were we given a menu of the courses or told what they were as they were being served. Next came salad/greens. Almost 20 minutes later, we were given steak. It was delicious, but served on a small to normal sized plate family style, meaning there was one portion for every three or four people at the table. Finally, we had beignets, or small deep-fried donuts. All of this food was good, but there just wasn enough of it. If youe paying attention youl notice that I only listed four courses, not five. Well, don be dismayed because apparently the bowls of olives that were put on the table when we arrived were one of the courses. Sigh.At the end of it all, I was given a bill for $84 but still hungry. Other reviewers have expressed their frustration about this place, which from what Ie seen is mostly warranted. Changes to the portion size for food and drinks could easily make SMN a go-to spot on H st, but based on my experience, I won be going back nor will I be recommending it to friends. Too much hipster-y pretentiousness for one meal., This place is what DC needs. Quick, casual, and friendly. Locally owned with local food - creatively prepared with a simple menu - written on white subway tile. Brunch is amazing - greens, eggs, potatoes, and great coffee., This could easily be my new favorite restaurant. Well worth a trip to H Street even though not my hood. Loved everything about it - great food, ambiance and service. The food was delicious - especially the sweet potato ravioli. The beet salad was also tasty. We ate at the bar and the bartender was terrific - he was appropriately attentive and really nice. Even the other patrons were nice. Wonderful dining experience., The food at Sallys Middle Name is good. Not great, but good. There was nothing wrong with any of the meat dishes we had--herb braised chicken with shiitake jus, snakefish with oyster mushrooms. They were tasty and moist, cooked well. The vegetable dishes, though, were all slightly undercooked. The turnips and the carrots were tough and more than the toothsome texture one might expect. The flavor was good enough, but it turned us off from the idea of ordering dessert. Plus, the place is loud. I realize that staff have no control at all over how loud their patrons are, but it was ear-bleedingly loud. In the end, I wanted to love Sallys Middle Name because of all the good things Id heard about it, but the enthusiasm just isnt there., A really great concept, Sallys features a small menu of mostly small plates. The menu changes and while it is focused on vegetables, this is not a vegetarian restaurant per se. Ive eaten here twice, and both times found the food very well conceived, perfectly executed, and delicious.The marinated olives were amazing. Like, I thought I liked olives, but these were somehow WAY better than any olives Ive had.I also had a pork dish with mustard greens. I do not like mustard greens, but these were amazing. Perfectly cooked, seasoned with something great, but still tasted of greens.Ive had the fried chicken special, which was really really good fried-chicken-for-a-place-that-doesnt-specialize-in-fried chicken. Have also had the tagliatelle, which was as well-made as any fancy italian place.Theres no particular _theme_ to the food here, but its all really good with preparations that are just a bit off standard, so you will be surprised and delighted by what they have.Service is great, and its very well appointed and comfortable., Great variety and fun place.Kind of a Roses wannabe - but, that is A-OK., Food is decent. I like the small plates options to try a few different things. I appreciate the most the focus on local fresh ingredients. I was most excited about their homemade ice cream from Trickling Springs dairy, but was disappointed when we had it - I would say the amount of sugar in it needed to be at about a third of its present level. We had dinner there and maybe Id give the place another try for brunch., Way overpriced for the amount of food you get. Service was slow. Our server took orders from and served parties to people seated way after us. Ran out of bay chicken only 1-2 hours into service, so we couldnt order one of the few protein dishes on the menu. I prefer the vinegar cocktails from Maketto., Potential review titles for Sallys Middle Name:1- If they told you her middle name, they would charge even more for the chicken thigh. 2- Sally isnt worth a middle name. 3 - Sally couldnt afford a middle name and 4, compliments of our friend Tom, Pricey and Dicey.The food is good, but way too pricey for the portions. The atmosphere is like a diner with tables that leave you no room for legs and the prices are white cloth. Too many other better options to bother going here again., I really wanted to like this place, but . . . its way too pricey for the quality & quantity of the food. The bill was more than $100 for 4 of us, & we left hungry! We really dont mind paying this amount for a meal, but the food here isnt worth it. The parsnips & carrots were undercooked. The brisket was dull. On the positive side, the pork cheeks were fine--all 5 bites of them. The cheddar cheese appetizer was good, too, though the chunk was tiny. If you want small plates that are great, skip Sallys & go to Garrison on 8th Street., TL;DR: its too expensive for too little food, theyre stingy with their beer, very sub par desserts, and an uncomfortable dining experience. The plates were fine, and even exceptional in the case of the chicken thigh (albeit overpriced), but there are a lot of things wrong with this place. The beers are about 30% overpriced considering how small they are. I dont mind that they use the same glasses for beer and water, and smaller water glasses for wine (as others have posted), but they need to just make the water/beer glasses bigger or lower the price. When you include the mandatory tip and tax, youre paying $8.96 for a small glass of beer. The beer selection is only OK. I know alcohol sales are a big part of what makes DC restaurants viable, but you cant be this blatant about it. Any beer drinker would be turned off by this. The tables were assembled poorly. They installed hairpin legs in the center of the table, this makes them extremely wobbly -- moveem out to the corners! This might seem nitpicky, but it makes the whole experience rather uncomfortable. Menus on the walls? Ok, if they had the right layout this might work, but they dont. Spend the 20 sheets of paper / day to print menus. Make it easy and comfortable for people to order food in your restaurant.The chocolate cake was terrible, 5 of us tried it, and no one could find any taste. The Szechuan ice cream had a pungent floral characteristic that several of our group could not stand -- Ill give it to our server, I think they tried to steer us away from this choice. The vanilla ice cream was pretty good. Service was adequate. Although when they deliver tiny beers and spill some of them each and every time, it really burns you. Please tighten that up.I think all of these problems are very correctable., Just love this place. Came here for my birthday and had a wonderful time. Dishes were all excellent. Highlights included a fantastic cardamom grapefruit dressing on some fantastic fresh baby greens, coffee-rubbed steak cooked perfectly, a delicious walnut/herb dressing to accompany some slightly-cooked carrots, incredible goats milk chocolate ice cream, a delicious cocktail (on their first day of making cocktails), and of course the great, friendly service and atmosphere. Cant wait to go back., Absolutely lip-smacking! This is a very cute restaurant that would be perfect for a date-night or for catching up with an old friend. My only advice is that you go in small groups (even though they take reservations) because its a small place. My absolute favorite dish was the SHARK MEAT. The meat was perfectly cooked, and was so well complimented by the coconut, ginger, parsley (coriander?) salad. They offer small plates, so my friend and I sampled more than half the menu. It was all very delicious. Our server was extremely friendly and made some good recommendations. Yes, its a little pricey as the other reviewers have noted, but I dont mind treating myself every now and then. My friend and I didnt leave hungry and even had some leftovers. The total bill between the two of us was $100, with two drinks each (they include 18% gratuity for all party sizes). I did take a peak at their brunch menu, and even though it seemed pretty basic, their focus on good quality ingredients, brings out the best in each dish. I also believe they dont have a fixed menu, so that gives me another good reason to go back., Truly a 6 star menu. We had a savory herb soup with delectable roasted mushrooms. Salads consisted of Swiss Chard, Apricot and Shallots ... Grilled Romaine, Harissa and Feta Cheese. A side dish of soy infused hard boiled eggs garnished with garlic and ginger. Cobia Fish with coconut salad. Desert was raspberry cardamom froyo, buttermilk pie, vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. Every bite sparked our taste buds. The best part was enjoying conversation with my daughter and her husband. Sarah was amazing and very attentive. 6 star!!!!!!, I mean the place is decidedly cool - very hipster and very quirky. That being said, I firmly believe there is a fine line between thinking out of the box and just being insolent and thinking you can get away with it. I get its fun to have your menu be written out on a chalk board - but hey, if people cant read it from where they are seated, you didnt really serve the purpose now, did ya?!I did love the mismatched cutlery and the little tea things all over the side wall. I have nothing against the decor - I think it was fun. All I remember is - I came here for an early dinner with a couple of friends - we spent over a 100 bucks between us and still left hungry. The portion sizes are super small, and they are not (and refuse to be) vegetarian friendly. Our server told us they couldnt modify any dishes to make them veggie friendly and their only veggie options turned out be bland. Guess what - the dishes were so meh, I dont recall what I ate honestly! All I recall is being super disappointed and having to go get a snack elsewhere!, Really great good, and Id talk about specific dishes but the beauty of this place is that they will be different the next time you go. Go with the idea that youll sample the wares of a fine chef and youll be happy., This restaurant is amazing. I honestly couldnt give them a high enough rating. I used them for a dinner of about 30 people. It was such short notice, but they pulled it off in the best possible way. They were so helpful and flexible about everything. They went above and beyond. Everyone loved the atmosphere, raved about the food, and the bartender is seriously one of a kind. I had so many of the guests tell me that they just gave him a list of ingredients and he created a unique and delicious cocktail. I highly recommend., Such an eclectic menu! We ended up getting almost everything on the menu, and since it isnt focused on one style or type of cuisine, it was quite a mix of flavors. It was all wonderful, just lacked a cohesion among all the plates., One of my favorites in DC. This foodie loves the innovative take on veggies, ever changing menu, great staff and vested owners. Only a year and a few months in, SMN is only getting better with time- and fast becoming a staple for many of us living on the H street corridor. Their progressive gratuity policy rivals the most progressive restaurants in NYC and SF and makes me happy to know that my great eating experience means that everyone gets a living wage., Over $200 for 4 people and we left HUNGRY! The beer was served in small glasses too. The small plates were $16-$18 and were truly small. One pasta dish came with two long wide noodles for that price. They include an 18% service fee, which accounts for the diffident service. No welcome, no explanation of menu. Hard chairs. It ok to be hipster but to charge exorbitant prices for poor service, dirty floors and hard chairs? Go somewhere else., first off, i really dont understand why gentrifiers have to be so hipster. this place looks like it belongs in silver lake in los angeles and not in dc. my issue with this place was the service, or the lack of. we were sat down before another similar sized group (three people) but received service after them, and that was only because we had to ask who our server was. this was our first time at smn so we were expecting printed menus but realized that the menu was up on the wall. It would have been nice if upon being seated, the server would have let us know about that and not have to sit there waiting for a menu. The other thing, when we finally got attended to, we had to keep asking the server for things that should have been offered or should have been at the table e.g. salt, pepper, hot sauce, sugar. the best part of this was receiving the check and realizing there was a service charge included. i know about included gratuity at other establishments, but its mostly for larger sized groups--6 and up--it was only three of us. Our server didnt deserve a tip. the brunch menu was not that appetizing either, actually. i purposefully got the cheapest thing--coffee cake for $5 (it was good)--so I could go next door to schawafel and get me a better meal. SUMMARY: the taste doesnt seem to be an issue at this place but service, portion size, prices, and the service charge are, by reading the other posts on here. lastly, im pretty lazy about reviewing things by my review history, so you know my experience was frustrating enough to compose and post this one., I have written maybe 2 reviews ever, but this place is incredible. The staff is incredibly friendly and personable, they will talk about the food with you as long as you want. The food was out of this world. A friend and I split, for brunch, the pork hash with poached eggs, the bacon bread, the rice porridge with pork and chilies, their green Bloody Mary, and some coffee. Everything was INCREDIBLE. The flavors, the presentation. Everything. And the atmosphere is just perfect, not pretentious in the slightest., I just ate one of the most innovative and delicious brunches at Sallys Middle Name. My friend and I ordered the pork hash, pork rice porridge, and bacon fried bread - these were delicious. The staff was so friendly, and I look forward to my next meal here - so good!
62|sushi-ogawa-washington|OGAWA IS FINALLY OPEN!!!!Came here last night (Feb 1) for their opening night. They have kept things a little bit under wraps about their grand opening. I found out because I live in the building. They have also advertised through their sister restaurant, Sushi Capitol, and Prince of Petworth has let the word out.Located in the 2100 Connecticut Ave, NW Apartments, Ogawa is not your typical sushi bar. There is a private dining room, a regular dining room, and a sushi bar. For opening night, they had a little appetizer plate with octopus, lotus root, and spinach topped with dried tuna.Their menu right now has limited options but the quality of the fish was great. This place isnt your cheap sushi spot. My boyfriend and I orderedSeafood tempura appetizer ($15) - two scallops, 2 pieces of salmon, one shrimp, and one piece of bonita fish - very good qualityUme sashimi ($26) - 13 pieces of sashimi - salmon, tuna, and whitefishUme sushi ($28) - Assorted nigiri and 6 maki piecesI also had the ikura with quail egg - ($10) - since it was opening night, they put this one on the house!They also serve green tea ice cream - major bonus. When we left, they gave each of their customers a special gift - Japanese sweet bread.While it is a little on the pricey side, and the menu does not have endless rolls to choose from, the quality of the fish is top notch, the service is friendly, and the ambiance is elegant. I will definitely be back.As of now, they only accept reservations and do not do take out, but once they get the ball rolling, they will alter that., After visiting Sushi Capitol a few times and seeing its popularity, I heeded the restaurants announcement they were accepting reservations and made one for tonight at 5 pm.I arrived a few minutes early and was greeted by two people who sat me at the sushi bar as per my telephone request. (Im not sure if sitting at the bar meant I had to get the omakase but seeing that my prior omakase experience at their sister restaurant was good and not wanting to decide, this was ok. I found out at the end they do serve a la carte if dropping $100 for dinner is not your thing.) Ogawa San and his fellow sushi partner now work here while his friend is managing the Capitol Hill location. Since I think I was the only customer for at least the first 90 minutes, I definitely got special treatment and got to speak with the gentlemen making my dinner and learned that while the grand opening was last night, they were still doing a bit of a soft opening and training and havent done any advertising. That said, depending on how things go, they might expand to offer lunch service. The restaurant actually has two private dining areas which can accommodate 6 - 8 people each, and each has a sliding door for privacy and a window overlooking Connecticut Ave. The main dining area accommodates at least 16 people, and the sushi bar can accommodate about 10 people. Also on my mini tour, I found out that the paintings in the hallway/entryway were commissioned and the main dining room had hand painted ceiling tiles with a print of fish, all of which they serve. Neat facts!Dinner began with a trio presentation made up of spinach and dashi, octopus and white radish, and lotus root and carrot.The second plate had lotus root, a sliver of radish with pompano fish, and fried shrimp head.The next course was a series of nigiri beginning with steelhead salmon which offered a smooth and cool flavor followed by a carefully torched king salmon that had a spicy kick. Black bluefish which comes from deep in the ocean was served next with a lemony flavored golden snapper behind it. Ogawa San asked if I like sea urchin and salmon roe, which I appreciate, because last time at Sushi Capitol, my sister and I didnt care for either. It was our first time trying either, and Im a little adverse to the appearance of both, but I decided to try again and was glad I did this time. Both were good, and in between, I finished the miso soup with spinach and lotus root. (Side note: Both Sushi Capitol and Sushi Ogawa serve the freshest fish Ive ever tried. Only at these places am I willing to be adventurous and try things I havent tried elsewhere. I talked to both chefs about the cheek appetizer and everyone agreed thats amazing. I hope thats offered here next time!)Then he took away one plate and presented me with another one. On this next round, I tried tuna, toro, a glass fish which was kind of fishy in taste to me, Japanese scallop with another smooth and clean taste, pink shrimp, yellowtail, a gently torched sea eel, and abalone, which I found to be chewy but good. (Ogawa San made sure to point out each fish as I was eating in terms of its origin and texture.) The red snapper was also torched because, as Ogawa San pointed out, the skin is chewy, and when its torched, its softer. The red snapper also had a lemony and salt and pepper flavor to it. Some of the other nigiri had soy sauce, wasabi, and other combinations of flavors.I also received what I think is a hosomaki with tuna and crab and avocado. Ogawa San asked which I preferred, and I said both were fine, either or, so it was nice, I got to try both. The second to last fish I didnt quite catch but I think he said its a seema achi (sp?) from Japan with the last being a Japanese red snapper with a sake and dried plum sauce and seaweed on top. Finally, I was served persimmon chunks and green tea ice cream for dessert after being asked if I was full. I thought that was nice. I felt like the whole evening they were trying to make sure I was happy and got a full range of the sea, which was definitely the outcome! Everyone was really nice. A couple of times I was offered green tea and only at the end did I have a cup. It was a nice finish and the cup was the perfect size for cradling. If I didnt feel like I was holding them up, I would have sipped it slower. Since word of mouth is how they seem like theyll be getting business, I highly recommend checking it out. Right now theyre open for dinner Monday - Saturday., Best sushi in DC!! Would qualify as high end in Tokyo. Finally its here! Thank you!!!, What an amazing omakase experience at sushi ogawa. We were so excited to try this place after hearing about its imminent opening from Can (general manager) at Sushi Capitol. Great space. Amazingly fresh sushi. Miso soup with shrimp head was Sooo comforting and flavorful yet light. We fear this will be the last time we can get a reservation easily as people will quickly catch on to what a gem this place is. Friendliest sushi chefs I have ever met too. Great service as to be expected from regulars at sushi Capitol. At $65 pp for omakase this is a ridiculous steal., Loved experiencing the Omakase from the charming Chef Ogawa. Our host John introduced us to a very nice cold sake.Rivals the experience of Yume in Alameda.Highly recommend sitting at the bar for Omakase youll never forget it., Sister to Sushi Capitol, expect nothing less. We got the sushi platter and uni. They had three types of uni today (massachusettes... well maybe maine, california, and japan). The meal started with miso soup with prawn head, delicious and savory. The each part of the sashimi platter was amazing, including items that usually are afterthoughts. The mackerel was not fishy at all and was actually slightly grilled on the skin side, probably the best piece of mackeral Ive tried as sashimi. The shrimp was sweet and delicate, something Im still thinking about. The salmon was slightly smokey, which enhanced the umami that I love in salmon. The octopus was fresh and had great texture. The surf clam was also a great unique texture. The amaki tuna was great, high quality and a great set up to the otoro. That otoro though... melt in your mouth, take you to heaven and back. Easily the best part of the meal. The uni was wonderful as well and comes in a close second (slightly nutty, light, earthy, complex).DC sushi game is strong thanks to Sushi Capitol and Sushi Ogawa., Amazing sushi, friendly servers, and perfect atmosphere. Went without a reservation and was seated promptly when I arrived on a Saturday night. We had the omakase and it did not disappoint. Next time I go back I will sit at the sushi bar and do the chefs tasting at the bar., Every time my sons rolls into DC the first place he asks to go is Sushi Capitol! So of course his request this time was to visit their new restaurant Sushi Ogawa. The restaurant is located on the quieter section of Wisconsin, about a a half mile up from Dupont Circle -- an easy walk from the metro. The interior is thoughtfully and artfully done with beautiful hand paintings on the walls as well as the ceilings. The Omakase meal is an absolute delight and quite a steal for the top quality of fish which is served--you will never experience anything better. This reservation was last minute for us so John kindly made room for us. Next time we will have to reserve farther in advance in order to experience the sushi bar which looked so inviting., Authentic. Omakaze dinner is great value for the quality of seafood and manner of presentation., After having fantastic experiences at Sushi Capitol, I was excited to try Sushi Ogawa. The restaurant was open on Valentines Day even though they are regularly closed on Sundays. I suggest making reservations via phone since my email request did not receive a response. No, I mean make your reservations now....call now! This place is that amazing. I knew that I would love this place as soon as I saw that zen garden-like entryway. There are two small dining areas and there are private dining rooms available too. We started with the seafood tempura: two pieces of salmon, scallop, a white fish, and a huuuge head-on shrimp. Fifty shremps please....and dont sleep on eating the whole shebang because it is sweet, juicy, and rich.We decided to do the Omakase which they offer at the sushi bar and at tables. The Omakase was a great choice for getting to know this new restaurant. I did not catch what the first taste was called but it was a dish with three different small bites: there was a piece of octopus that was a bit too small to savor and a taste of seaweed salad. We were served 15 different pieces of nigiri--and I loved so many of them but the most notable pieces were the steelhead salmon, scallop, and toro (which I saved for last because it looked sooo good). After that, we were served a toro hand roll which was such a treat because it meant more of that fresh and buttery fish--fantastic. Then, the miso soup with shrimp head which infused the usual mild soup with a pop of flavor. With the check, we received a small piece of Japanese chocolate with a tiny bit of green tea filling and I wish they could sell me huge bars of this. I am so impressed by this place because it was fresh, delicious and not ridiculously expensive., Hands down best sushi Ive had in DC. The omakase was phenomenal. So much care and ceremony put into every course. A real treat, We visited Sushi Ogawa just a few days after it opened.We live a block away and were eagerly awaiting the opening.Having never visited Sushi Capital, we figured that it would be worth jumping in with both feet with the omakase tasting menu from the sushi bar. Simply put, it was phenomenal!!!The two sushi chef were friendly, inviting and despite limited english, carefully explained the various courses and types of fish that we were enjoying. Serving the meal one-bite-at-a-time ensured the freshest possible tastes and a delightfully leisurely pace. I also most note the wonderful service, despite a few opening week hiccups. The main example being the welcoming and warm manager attentive service and our professional and humorous server who had to deal with an extremely noisy group of foul-mouthed sorority girls who were holding court in the not-so-private dining area (they must have mistaken the rice paper walls and sling door for heavy duty soundproofing).We are so thrilled to have Sushi Ogawa in our neighborhood and will certainly make it a regular spot for special event meals and when devoted sushi fans come to town to try the omakase experience. We also look forward to trying the a la carte menu for a more modestly priced yet undoubtedly authentic meal., Best sushi in the DC area. Ive tried all the top places. Starts with a peaceful slate entrance. Late on a Tuesday night, it was pretty empty -- in a good way, like peaceful.Ordered the omakase at the sushi counter., Truly mediocre, bland and unimaginative for such prices. Ie ordered omakase (leave it up to the chef) at Japanese restaurants around the world, and this is typically the place for a chef to not only give you premium quality fish but to impress and surprise you with his or her inventiveness and diversity of arrangements. We ordered the omakase here at $60/person, expecting something comparable, but what arrived was a massive disappointment. It started with a plate of 3, literally, bite-size appetizers: 2 micro-pieces of overly dry mackerel, some stewed salmon and vegetables (like a 2 cm sliver of carrot), and a miniscule portion of run of the mill seaweed and cucumbers. The next two courses were platters with 6 pieces of sushi each, which, although the fish was high quality, this was nothing that you could not find in any mid-level sushi restaurant. The finale of this utterly lackluster dinner was ... wait for it ... a hand roll! Yes, a chopped yellowtail hand roll! Oof. Ie had omakase in other restaurants where each piece of sushi was a miniature theater in the mouth of surprising combinations of tastes and textures, arranged artfully in diverse ways. One also expects to get a course of vegetables, and soup. An omakase I had recently in Rotterdam, of all places, started with a delicate broth in a shot glass topped with a shrimp foam, followed by an assortment of beautifully displayed pickled vegetables, and on and on, each course more delicious than the next. The wait staff here are all very nice, although a bit awkward and too intrusive. Anyway, this place needs to really up their game to justify prices like this. If the chef is this uncreative, then get another chef. And offer some vegetables on your menu!! I had to rush home afterwards and shove some spinach in my mouth because I was so veggie deprived. The decor too really felt like a non-Japanese person clumsily trying to make a Japanese restaurant. Extremely disappointing on all regards., For my first Yelp review I decided to start with this brand new hot spot. We are a family of sushi lovers and had been excited about trying Sushi Ogawa ever since we heard it was the sister restaurant of Sushi Capital on Pennsylvania Ave. It did not disappoint! We ordered the Sashimi Platter to start as well as an extra order of red snapper. My son was feeling adventurous so he tried the octopus which he enjoyed. Or at least put on a brave face. I had a piece and it was phenomenal. Everything was really. The staff were gracious and professional, the space is beautifully decorated and the prices were far lower than we had been expecting. We had a great time and look forward to coming back., went here with a couple of girlfriends for the omakase experience at the sushi bar. we were served by chef ogawa-san himself. i almost want to keep this place a secret because i know once people start finding out about this place it will really start to fill up. high quality sushi and service here. im loving that there finally is a legit omakase place in our area. were already planning our next visit. deliciousssss!!! chef ogawa even threw in an extra toro at the end for us because we told him we were sad it was over., I hit up Sushi Ogawa after a long day of conference meetings. Thanks to a large lunch I wasnt that hungry, but I wanted to give them a shot. I started with the miso soup with shrimp head -- it was the best miso soup Ive ever had! The depth that the shrimp gave the miso was very nice, although not everyone might like the added robustness. I also had an appetizer trio, which was 1 small (1 cm x 4 cm) piece of seared white fish, a raw mini-squid on a bed of cucumber and seaweed, and another dish (3 bites) that had some marinated carrot. It was all very good, although eating the squid was unusual! I finished off with a couple pieces of salmon nigiri and a couple pieces of coronet fish nigiri. They were both very fresh and tasty, with no excessive fishy smell or flavor. The green tea and service were great, although I was a little disappointed at the lack of dessert.The only real down-side (and the reason for the docked star) was the unisex restroom. I went only 1.5 hours after opening, and it was dirty already! The large trashcan was half full, suggesting that it had been left over from the night before, since its unlikely that it could get that full that quickly. The sink and area in front of the toilet were soiled -- the sink with dirt, the floor with -- well, I can only assume the male visitors had trouble aiming. I mentioned something to the hostess and she said shed have it fixed. If I were a local Id give it one more shot before writing it off., So pros: it was excellent sushi, for a very reasonable price. We had the omakase tasting menu from the sushi bar for $60 and could not finish everything. Really fresh and unique fish, including Uni from Massachusetts. The entryway with stones are a nice touch, and if you had ever been to Pines of Florence, this place bears no resemblance to it. But the cons were really glaring and made the whole experience difficult to enjoy. Our waitress was intrusive, bordering on rude and kept interrupting our meal. It was the opposite of what you would experience in Japan. The decor of the main dining room (I wish now I had requested the sushi bar) is very spare with these enormous chairs that look like they came secondhand from a bad Chinese buffet. Finally, I was disappointed the omakase did not demonstrate the creativity that you expect to see with a chef tasting menu.So giving them 3 stars as the quality of the food, but suggest they work on their front of house!, What a treat! Have not had sushi of this caliber since my last trip to San Francisco. We had a seat at the sushi bar and had the pleasure of very personal service. Only 7 seats, and well worth the expense. If you are not familiar with terrific fish and the preparation this would not be the place to go. But if you have a discriminating pallet for sushi, give it a go. I dont think you will be disappointed., We stopped by on a Friday evening to do the omakase. We made reservations via email in advance but it looked like you could maybe show up without reservations (at least until Sushi Ogawa becomes more popular). We opted for a table experience rather than sitting at the sushi bar since it had been awhile since my friends and I had caught up. The dining area was very quiet and sparse. So sparse, I found it a little disconcerting at first. Tables are close so hushed tones may be best for convo. By the end of my meal, I had a 180 in opinion and found the minimalist setting really let the dining experience shine through. We all decided to do the omakase for $60. My first omakase, I promised myself to eat everything regardless of what we were served. Im glad I did and found that some fish that I have not enjoyed in the past were really fantastic here. My usual favorites were still my favs: salmon, tuna, and uni. Ive never had snapper and it was delicious, I typically dont like mackerel and it was very mild, not fishy, and melt in your mouth tender. Not sure why but I never order salmon roe and it was a great combo of salty and sweet. I also dont usually get the raw scallop or shrimp but all were lovely with a touch of sweetness. My least favorites were the bonito and the uni. Ive never had bonito but wasnt a huge fan and I love uni but it had an iron-ey taste rather than a clean, mildly sweet taste that Ive experienced elsewhere. Service was friendly and paced our meal very well. Shortly after wed finish a course, theyd remove the plates and wed have a new surprise in front of us! Oddly and comically, their water cups were super small and two sips of water and it would be halfway gone. The staff did a great job keeping our waters full.Overall, the entire experience was really fun and very delicious. The omakase was very affordable for the quality and quantity we received. We left with a very clean-eats full and hope to return again!, O-Toro- OMG- to die for. ! ! ! Last night was Blue-fin toro. And we just kept eating it -_-We had a reservation for 8pm and I couldnt close my shop early enough to get there on time so I called and informed them I was going to be 15-20 minutes late. It turned out to be 45 minutes late but the host was very accommodating and told me it was ok and to just get there safely. $80 for the omakase bar and $60 for the table omakase. I would give the quality of the fish here a 8/10 except the Toro last night was a 11/10. Good God, that thing was good. The meal starts with 3 tiny dishes followed by 13 nigiri pieces, a miso soup with shrmp head which was a first for me, and then finishing with a hand roll. I actually like it better than the regular miso soup since the shrimp added additional flavor making it less salty. You then have the option to order extra sushi if you wish. I didnt realize it was going to be charged per piece and assumed that it was in a fixed price range, depending on what you eat- like other omakase experiences that Ive had. I guess I shouldve asked.The bar is in an area separate from the main dining area and all of the restaurants food comes from there so the chef wasnt really attentive as I felt he shouldve been. He just places our fish on the plates and told us what it was and then moved on. Through out the course of the meal, we had to wait awhile in between fish since he had to cater to other customers. They give you disposable chopsticks which I find really cheap for a more high end sushi restaurant. I hate having to break the chopsticks to use them. Will surely be back for the sushi but this time will opt for table dining since paying extra to sit at the bar wasnt worth it., As of the writing of this review. Sushi Ogawa is easily the best sushi restaurant in DC. They have an authentic sushi counter where you can see sushi chef Ogawa working on your omakase. He is the star sushi chef from Sushi Capitol and previous worked at Mandarin Oriental DC. I frequent sushi joints in New York City and this place in DC is as close as you get compare to the NYC standard.Definitely go for the Omakase Sushi - equivilant to chefs specials, at the counter at $80 per person. If you love sushi, you already know this is an incredible price anywhere for omakase course. Their fish is a cut above anywhere I tried in DC, including Sushi Taro, especially their fatty tuna is the best in DC. I have been to Sushi ogawa now a few times and noticed the fish they use at the omakase course - at the counter, is definitely different than the one they used for the regular table. I have tried the regular table service and even for the omakase course its not as good as the counter experience. You can see while you are at the counter that all fishes come from a seperate wooden box in the refrigerator under chef Ogawas counter. While the other chef is preparing table service sushi course using different fishes in the glass refrigerator. In my opnion, the $20 dollar difference is well worth it for the better quality fish selection., We were decided to go to Sushi Capitol. But Im sooooo glad they didnt pick up the phone.. We such around and come across to SUSHI OGAWA. So we give it a try! OMGGGG... Food is good. Fish is fresh. Our server HYO is outstanding!! Giving this place 5stars and HYO 3 thumbs up!, Where do I begin? Ah yes, even a 30 minute wait after we arrived to our reservation time cant ruin our night.I wanted to do something special for the wife and thought Sushi Ogawa had all the right mixes: well-known sushi chef, quality ingredients, sushi bar option, reasonable pricing and not a well-known place yet. And after we had finished our what seemed like 12-14 courses of heavenly bites, the night was extremely memorable and the service was top-notch.As other Yelpers have said: you have the choice at the dining table ($60) or at the chef bar ($80) but its definitely better at the bar for several reasons:- the atmosphere of seeing the chefs preparation and technique are memorable- its a cozier feeling than the dining room since you can only sit up to 8 at a time at the bar, while the dining room lacked any sort of interior design- one chef was preparing for the dining room orders while the other (the better and well-known one) was for the bar customers, but I didnt see different fish being servedThings that didnt bother me:- Wooden chopsticks at the bar, versus regular chopsticks at the dining table. I think its smarter this way because the sushi rolls can get fairly slippery, and using wooden chopsticks ensure better friction surface area so you dont look like a chump dropping sushi on the table.- Same plate for the entire experience. Since wasabi and sauce are already built into each sushi roll, you dont need to dip or add anything, besides a little bit of ginger in between.- Only 3 Japanese beers available plus sake. Do you really need more?Overall all of the courses were great. There wasnt one course I didnt like and we were definitely full afterwards. You get full because most of the courses are served nigiri style, so all the rice will bound to expand in your belly. You can ask the chef to put less rice if youre getting full and there are more courses to come - better to do that than waste the rice on your plate. Pro tips on getting here:Monday-Friday before 6:30pm: consider metro, uber or parking garageMonday-Friday after 6:30pm: you can park at the embassy street parking spots (they are obvious as their signs are different than permit parking signs)Saturday-Sunday: no issue here but metro on weekends are historically terrible, We came here for the Omakase at the table ($60/p). The fish quality was phenomenal and I can easily say this was the best sushi that I have ever had in my life. Fish that I thought I would not enjoy like Mackerel or Red Snapper were absolutely delicious and everything just melted in your mouth. The amount of food you get for $60 is fair and you don leave feeling hungry. I only wish they would offer maybe 1-2 more nigiri or maybe a small desert of some kind. Service is very polite and attentive, though it can be a bit awkward at times. I think the wait staff is still getting used to or needs a bit of training in high-end formal service. That may just be me nit-picking as I have worked in high-end dining and hospitality. The food is phenomenal quality, only that that Sushi Ogawa is lacking is ambiance, like many other sushi restaurants. Chairs seem like they were bought second-hand from a Chinese buffet and there aren any wall decorations. If you are looking for ambiance and ritzy environment, this place isn it. Youe going for the food.I will definitely be back for special occasions because you really cannot find sushi this quality in the DC area., Fantastic sushi! Great experience, this felt exactly like I had seen in documentaries and on shows. Wonderful service and great sake selection. Ask for Jeff! Hes super knowledgable on sake and beer pairings with the sushi!, After eating the omakase at Sushi Capitol, I had to try the omakase here as Sushi Capitols chef came here. I would say I prefered Sushi Capitols omakase. The omakase here was good, but I felt they used too much wasabi and it was too spicy and really just knocks your head over. I am someone who loves spicy too, but the balance wasnt quite here., Better even than its press. We had the Omakase dinner at the sushi bar. All I can say is...sublime. Apps, sashimi and sushi to die for. Exquisite fish, great experience, great service, wonderful sake. Flawless!, Yes, the sushi alone is five stars, phenomenal - melt in your mouth. The uni? (sea urchin parts...) good lord, unreal. As good as Sushi Taro, BUT hold a second - at the same price as Sushi Taro? Two chef tastings, some light beers, and tip: $220. Thats ouchy. Evidently they bumped the price from $60 a tasting to $80 a tasting (per previous reviews.) So heres the deal: if youre going to charge those prices (no booze or dessert) you need to do some serious atmospheric tweaking. We love our dive bars and hole in the walls. I have no issue with wooden chopsticks, and we did get replated. This isnt a cool, stripped-down atmosphere to focus on the sushi, the space has no charm. Heres my biggest beef: the little ante-room where the chef tasting takes place at the sushi-bar: its silent. Completely devoid of any sound. Zero decibels. Maybe a tiny twinkling of music in the background? Conversation during our semi-awkward dinner was whispery. Not good.Sushi Ogawa, my two cents: go back to $60 a plate, thats an appropriate price for your phenomenal sushi and zero-charm atmosphere. As-is, we will not be returning. If you think you have the swagger to charge $80 a plate I highly recommend you have a professional come-in and help you improve your space. And please give us something sweet at the end other than a piece of watermelon, and maybe, just maybe a little complimentary sake? Two bits of praise: when we had our crave, Sushi Taro was booked and these guys had a chef tasting seat for us when I reserved at lunch that day. Good! We were starving when we arrived, and walked out stuffed. Thats good too! The omakase is delicious and satisfying. Overall 3.5 stars. Bump to 4.5 at $60 a plate - make a slight adjustment to lighting and turn the knob on your sound system (at $60 a plate) and youve reached the ethereal 5 stars., The best quality toro Ive had outside of Japan. Its arguably as good as the best Ive had in Kyoto. Prices are reasonable for this level of quality. Two Imamate at the bar with two small bottles of saki was a little over $100 a person. Extra otoro pieces were $8 per, which was more than reasonable., We have been long-time diners at sister restaurant Sushi Capitol, and will likely continue to dine there more because it is in our neighborhood. But I must say, the sushi we were served at Sushi Ogawa is superior. We sat at the sushi bar and didn realize we were limited to Omakase, but we were not disappointed. In other restaurants, at the end of the Omakase service, anything else you want becomes a la carte. But it seems that at Sushi Ogawa, if you want more of something you get it. The service is very simple, with pickled ginger and all other condiments added to the preparation. Aside from having incredibly fresh fish, many/most of the fish are lightly seared before serving. This has the effect of warming the fish and releasing some of its fat to increase its flavor and tenderness--really excellent. This technique works extremely well on the fattier tuna varieties which are already properly aged. The night we visited they had two different but equally delicious mackerel. Also, we were served the best uni we have ever had anywhere. Other reviews have noted the spare decoration and isolation of the sushi bar from the other dining room. Fair comments but secondary to the main attraction. The welcome of the dining room staff and the presentation by the Itamesan of the fish you will be served make up for the decor. And perhaps in response to comments, they now serve a very basic sweet at the end of the meal. My sole negative is that there is not a sashimi option available. Perhaps the nature of the fish preparation does not lend itself to sashimi, but for us, leaving the rice behind is a health choice., Very impressed. Great sushi. Great value for the amount, quality and selection they provide. Hidden gem for now that soon will be hard to get in. Adding it to my rotation. In the same league as Sushi Taro and a great addition to DC. Thank you chef Ogawa!, Everything was incredible! (Although the rice could be a little bit more softer and tight...) Favorites: Toro was something to die for but no more than 2 pieces, otherwise Ill start vometing due to too much fat... urchin and amaebi - the texture was perfect ... fried shrimp head as appetizer, yum...Got to start saving some money and revisit :p, After hearing of this new location opening from Sushi Capitol, I was very curious to try.I arrived here with my friend a touch before 5:00 PM on a reservation for 2 at the sushi counter for omakase. Chef Ogawa masterfully prepared us an omakase that covered a wide spectrum of fish in rapid succession. Our initial courses prior to the nigiri included baby scallop, tofu skin, and fried soft-shell crab and flounder. All were masterfully executed in both flavor and texture.Then, our nigiri wave came. Our pieces included bluefin tuna, bluefin tuna belly (medium fatty and fatty), sweet shrimp, gizzard shad, sweet shrimp, sea urchin, scallop, bonito, striped horse mackerel, grunt fish, mackerel, butter fish, cuttlefish, amberjack, golden eye snapper, octopus, sea eel, and finally a tuna hand roll. All of the aforementioned pieces were expertly crafted and dressed; all should be eaten as quickly as you can. Also keep in mind, Chef Ogawa uses freshly grated wasabi root which is rarely found in most sushi establishments.I really enjoyed the new decor and ambiance as it was a more intimate and had a more upscale feel at the sushi counter versus Sushi Capitol. As a warning, it is very difficult to park in the area so if you are up for the challenge of parking I would advise coming earlier in the evening., Intimate and excellent!This is surely a five star sushi restaurant, some of the best Ive ever had. I Irecommend getting one of their chefs selections and enjoy it with some good sake. The food quality is tops, they use freshly ground wasabi and the chef applies it to the sushi in the proper proportion rather than leaving it to the customer to mess up! The waiter was pleasant and knowledgeable. Yeah ambience was simple but elegant. Great place for a date :-), Wow. Fresh fresh and fresh! Amazing array of sushi. Presentation was exquisite. Service was excellent. One of the best sushi meals I have had in a very long time.
63|sushi-taro-washington|Great fresh fish, and a big selection of sushi which looks just beautiful when presented. Many say its one of DCs most authentic Japanese restaurants... you will sit on the floor on low tables, and watch the food being prepared right there in the main dining room. The wait for a table is usually long, and it might help to make reservations, especially if you have a big group. The prices are normal/medium range for Japanese food, and the waiters were friendly., The best. The best. The best. I havent been to the place on Macarthur Blvd but I dont see the need since Im always happy here., 3.5 stars actually. The decor isnt anything really special except for the...not sure what they are called...you know you take off your shoes and sort of sit on the floor....Service was quick and friendly.THe food was fantastic. Very fresh fish. The sashimi appetizer is must if you like tuna, salmon and whitefish. Get a skewer of the Kobe beef - a deal for $4 (probably not authentic but still DEE-Lish). The rolls are good but nothing better than any other top quality sushi place. A pet peeve of mine is when fish is chopped up in maki rolls (which sushi taro does). I like when the rolls are made with chunks of fish. One thing that I thought was cool was that they had a tempura menu that you mark off like a sushi menu. Lots of varieties but a bit expensive for what you get.Verdict: Id go back., I haven gone to many of the better sushi places in the city (the only one though that comes to mind is Sushi Ko, but anyway...), though the several times I have gone to Sushi Taro I have had consistently good sushi. The service on the other hand, has been hit or miss. The prices are higher (this is a Japanese restaurant -- not pan-Asian so I not expecting $10 meals), but the presentation is fantastic and the quality of the ingredients seems of a higher quality than most. Unfortunately, the place has been discovered and is often too crowded -- what used to be a great neighborhood sushi spot, has now become a destination for many., FANTASTIC nigiri -- amazingly fresh. definitely a little on the pricey side, but well worth it for the quality of fish!, Good, centrally-located Japanese. Sushi Taro is the place I most regularly goto for sushi in the District because it has a large selection of good, though not necessarily great, fish and is close to Dupont. For example on Friday, they had sanma (saury), baby snapper, and Japanese scallop along with several others as specials. These were quite good but then the kanpachi (yellowjack) was oddly very fatty. They do have a lot of other menu items but I normally stick to sushi. This place is big and rambling but always busy, so be prepared to wait (on Friday night around 8:30, it was 30-45min for two). As one friend recently complained, Sushi Taro has the feel of an izakaya (Japanese tavern) but without the izakaya, usually low, prices. And for about $5-10 per nigiri order, in more sushi-loving cities on the West Coast or NYC, Id expect more consistently great fish or a more upscale restaurant, but this is DC. There doesnt seem to be many great Japanese choices around, so Im happy its here., Its an upstairs over a danky drug store so you can miss it on this street with everything gay.Missing it is a crime. Kicking it to you appropriately they give you the choice to have table on the foor seating., Good quality sushi! Fatty Salmon, Toro and tempura all very good. DONT get the Kobe Beef... terrible! Ive had kabobs at Moby Dicks that tasted better than what they served up! The wait was horrendous, 20 minutes at 9pm on a Friday night... crazy! Also, dont think your going to get a spoon with your Miso soup... everyone in my party asked for one but were told that they didnt serve spoons with their soups, so we all sipped out of our bowls, looking at each other with questioning glances. Once again, I will stick by my tried and true KOTOBUKI! Our group actually left Sushi Taro after spending god knows how much and went to Kotobuki to finish off our appetites... should have gone there first!!!!!, My friends and I are SUSHI fanatics. A couple of us came to DC to see some friends, who took us to Sushi Taro. HANDS DOWN the best sashimi Ive ever had (I ordered the sashimi combo C). You cant beat the freshness, its melt in your mouth delicious. I had their steak which was also wonderful. Supposedly they dont sell kobe beef here anymore, but the kobe beef rolls are also delicious!I heard you have to make reservations days ahead of time because the wait is long, but DO IT. I would eat here everyday if I lived in the area. Lucky friends.. =( We cant stop raving about it!, Sushi Taro is one of those places that you just don expect. I driven by that CVS at 17th and R or S, or wherever it is 100 times and never in a million years would I have expected one of DCs most talked about Sushi restaurants to chill over the Crappy Variety Store (as ie come to call it). one of its other reviewers said it best:  Fish aside, the first piece of sushi I put in my mouth reminded me why good sushi is so important to me and so difficult to find. I couldn agree more. While I spent more money at Taro in one meal than I have at other favorite sushi spots in 4, I have to say that it was, just as a Ruths Chris Steak, worth every last cent. It one of those places Il go to treat myself for a job well done on something. I ordered a bit of everything--each piece of fish at Taro is fresh as can be and you can taste and feel the difference, the texture of it is just butter like--practically melts on your tongue. It been a while since ie been, so i can remember exactly what I had, but the fatty tuna was amazing--so much so that after eating 2 peices of it (at $8) I ordered more--i just didn care...unfiltered sushi was introduced to me here and i love it. One thing I didn appreciate was the fact that I ordered a soybeen tuna sashimi salad dish that was basically tuna sashimi mixed with soybeans and this disgusting sticky sauce. The soy beans tasted awful and the waitress laughed at me when I ordered it, but said very good for you which I thought strange. When I got it, the Sushi chef looks at me and goes ah, very good for you! but he laughed at me too! Then I tasted it and realized that very good for you must be their way of telling me you poor bastard, that tastes like ass, but look on the bright side....All in all the service was alright. Youl definitely want to reserve a table in advance for this place, as it always packed and the lady who runs the host stand isn the most organized of people. And when eating here you have two options: go all out and satisfy your tastebuds, or go easy and satisfy your wallet. It real easy to drop $100 on yourself at this place, so if youe not willing to do so, eat a sammich beforehand :), Dont let the location scare you (above the CVS at 17th and P) this place is great! Great fish! Great service! Cute guys! When Im at Sushi Taro, life is good., Sushi. Wow.Kathy and I created a tradition that we now must uphold: annually in December -- most recently between Christmas and New Years -- we must eat at a high-quality sushi restaurant. Wee not talking about a local spot around the corner from our apartment or in a nearby neighborhood, but rather a place that is far away from where we live such as in Honolulu, Philadelphia or D.C. Keeping with tradition we asked the front desk staff of Hotel Rouge for dinner recommendations that were within walking distance of the hotel and they suggested a little sushi place just a couple of blocks away. They said it was the best in the city (wee heard that before) so assuming there got to be something better than a little neighborhood joint, we wandered over with low expectations.We were so wrong; there probably nothing better in D.C. than Sushi Taro. The restaurant was simply incredible -- best darn sushi we had in a while (Morimoto in Philadelphia was the sushi restaurant of December 2004). Keep in mind, one goes to Sushi Taro for the food, not the atmosphere. If you want to go for ultra-cool and trendy, this is not the place.Go there. Eat sushi. Be very happy., Very good sushi and excellent sashimi at good value, comfortable though crowded environment, friendly staff. I didnt think you could find good sushi in Washington but Taro would rival any you can find on the West coast or in NYC. Would I come back to Washington for it?...not likely., This probably amounts to heresy among sushi fanatics, but whats the BFD about this place? The inside looks fantastic, Ill give you that. You can eat at the bar, sit at a table, or kneel at a table.The place was a bit crowded, as any popular place usually is, but it didnt feel too cramped. It did get really loud and echoey with the tall ceilings. Started sounding like a bingo hall in there.Now the sushi... oh get the pitchforks and torches ready and prepare to run me out of town. I wasnt impressed with the sushi at all. The rolls I got were miniscule with tiny bits of fish. The taste, eh.I figure theres no possible way that so many other DCers would rate so highly of a place that wasnt good (?) so Ill give it another try sometime and get some other items off the menu. If anyone wants to prove me wrong and fund a future visit to Sushi Taro, just send me a message!, We have a friend, a former Washingtonian, whos been in Kabul the last few years. Whenever he gets leave in the U.S., Sushi Taro is the first place we go. Im no sushi expert, and to be honest their vegetarian options could be better. But this friend and my husband both swear by the sushi. The restaurant has a cool setup - you can sit at the sushi bar, or sit near the floor Japanese-style, or get regular tables and chairs. It tends to be loud and crowded. Be prepared for a long wait, esp. around dinner., I cant compare it to the other sushi joints in DC, but coming from Cali, this place is about average in terms of quality of sushi. Its obviously a popular restaurant in Dupont, lots of people were waiting and the little bar was packed with hopeful eaters. I had gotten the nigiri/sushi combo, which was a very nice assortment of different types of nigiri. The sushi bar was packed, and they have an army of people behind the counter preparing the sushi, the teriyaki, etc., and service was polite and prompt., Ive got two words for you: fatty tuna. The Friday night crowd was buzzing, but the wait wasnt too bad. The maitre d told us 40 minutes, but we had barely cracked our bottle of of sake at the stand-up bar before they were calling our name. Sushi Taro is a great drinking restaurant, not because they serve a particularly wide selection of alcohol, but because you can get a good bottle of cold sake, eat for three hours, and spend $300 total for 3 people. Fortunately, the wide selection and great food make it a great eating restaurant as well. The wide variety of sushi, meats, and other foods we sampled were all excellent.While Sushi Taro doesnt strike me as an every weekend type of restaurant, its a great place to go to celebrate, or just to live it up., Had heard about this place so recently when an out-of-town friend came to visit we met up there. Being located just off Dupont Circle it was nice that they have validated parking available right across the street. I am a sushi nut so I was very pleased to find the sushi fresh and well presented. The cuts are not as large I have had before but the taste and preparation make up for that. (I am not suggesting that they are any smaller than normal. They were adequate.) I enjoyed the atmosphere too. There are short tables which you can take off your shoes to sit at as well as more normal tables for those who prefer not to bent down as far. All in all Ill definitely go back the next time Im in the Dupont area!, CVS Sushi. I have been meaning to go here to try the ramen -- but the sushi is wonderful and the lunch deal is indeed a deal as others have mentioned.I do think the quality at Sushi Taro is better than Sakana. At the same time, I think I might pick Sakana over Sushi Taro. For one, Sakana has the tempura roll -- its like this big brick of sushi with a tempura layer -- probably not very authentic, but is is one of my favorite things....Back to Sushi Taro, very nice service and all of the dishes looked wonderful. I had lunch here recently and had a bento box with Teriyaki chicken -- it was delicious -- and a steal at $10.I will be back! Watch for a ramen update! Ramen is served at lunch Monday through Wednesday., Having tried manysushi places in DCI would say this is probably the best one Ive tried yet since last yearor in prior years.The wait was long but the sushi was surprisingly excellent and not as expensive as I expected.I finally had the opportunity to experience the $10 lunch special and I would go back everyday if I could., Good solid Japanese food. The menu is quite extensive, I must say. I have entertained some people who are not used to eating Japanese food over here; I enjoy that they have most of the typical things on the menu and they are quite good.I would call this place authentic, definitely acceptable for the Japanese people from Japan. It is conveniently located.They have good lunch deal, as well., I do not give 5 star reviews often. When I do, it means that everything was perfect. Sushi Taro was perfect. Although their website says that they won make reservations for lunch after 12:30, I called and got a reservation for 1pm. Once I got there, I realized that we probably would have gotten a seat anyway. My first impression of Sushi Taro was happiness that the wait staff and sushi chefs were all Japanese. It kind of a relief. I don know what it is, but it shows a kind of authenticity. It also helps when there are actual Japanese patrons sitting down, having their lunch. Everyone was also friendly. We walked in and were greeted in that typical Japanese Irashaimaseeee!!!!! which apparently annoys some people, but I love it. It makes me happy. We got seated and were served right away, even though it was a full house. In fact, the service was impeccable, even though it was full house. I had the croquette lunch box ($10). Japanese croquettes are so tedious to make that no one in my family actually ever took the time of effort to make them. That means that, when I was a kid and got to order my own food when we went out, this is what I ordered. And I must say that the croquettes at Sushi Taro were fantastic - incredibly crispy on the outside and so soft and creamy on the inside that they basically fell apart. The lunch comes with tempura, which was soft and fluffy, some pickles, rice and miso soup. You are stuffed afterwards, but it not that type of omg, I shouldn have eaten that stuffed. It the other oh that was so incredible stuffed. Long story short, I was so happy walking out of Sushi Taro, I was almost happy to go back to work., We went here on Thurs 10/4/07 for lunch. We thought it was just ok.Its on the 2nd floor of the same building as CVS Store 17th NW and P Street close in Dupont Circle.We got:I had a sushi lunch special: 7 nigiri and a roll. Chef choice. just ok like $14.Hubby got curry chicken like $9.then we got 3 other nigiri average $5-6 yikes!Total was like $40. Not worth the money. Best just to eat wherever you are close to and dont chase recommendation all over the city., Dont be afraid to bring your non-sushi eating friends here!I dont like sushi, so I didnt eat that here, but the rest of the people in my party said the sushi and sashimi were both great (they ordered the chefs selection platter for $48 each).I had the chicken teriyaki, a safe choice, I know. It was a wonderfully cooked chicken -- my only complain would be that I would have liked more rice on the side.The service here is great. The waitress checked on us often, refills were plentiful, plus she explained everything we ordered perfectly.I would definitely go back, but am also anxious to take my sushi-loving fiancee to other great sushi spots in town., Great like all the other reviews say, cool place for a date, make sure she (or he, I guess) isnt allergic to anything ordered. Logistically, there can be a bit of a wait, so get there early and put your name down if its a busy night, then come back. At 8 pm on a Friday, there was a 30 minute wait for 2 people and larger parties were being told one hour. They understandably dont take reservations during peak times. Unless youre particular about your sake, the house sake is fine. My Japanese friend told me that this place is known in the Japanese community for having the best sushi, which I gather means its legit. They dont give rice laden sushi with little slivers of fish either--big cuts of raw fish, yum. Two bottles of sake and two large sushi platters set me back $75, including tax and tip. Not bad., I went to this place with a friend on a Saturday night around 8:30, and we were seated in 10 minutes, even though the place was packed. The sushi is very good, and the amount of fish was generous. It was smokey, but thats due to the somewhat open kitchen., Very well made sushi. The food is fresh and tasty and the presentation is well above average. Definitely one of the better sushi places Ive been to. All the employees seem to be Japanese so you know youre getting some authentic fare. They seem to use a different menu for dinner (with more choices) so definitely check it out in the evening if you can., Yes. This place is delicious! A friend and I went on a busy Friday night and were immediately seated at the bar. BONUS! Really - the restaurant was seriously busy. A testament to its food because the location can be easy to miss. When I visit a new sushi establishment, I always run an acid test on my regular order of yellowtail nigiri sushi:1. Relative proportion of sushi to ball of rice underneath should resemble a bed comforter on a bed. This means that I wanna see some drape!2. Spread of wasabi between sushi and rice should be present and enough to adhere both pieces together reasonably.3. Accompanying ginger should not contain lipstick pink hues.Sushi Taro passed! Yay! My eating partner and I had put in several orders for sushi, tempura, and yakitori (the quantity of which was WAYY too ambitious for just the two of us), but apparently the food gods were watching out because we only received our orders to sushi. Ha. In a weird way, the botch worked out in our favor. The service was attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was slightly noisy and amusing. A couple next to us put in a large order for salmon sashimi, which looked great. I think their order was inadvertent. Hehe... they didnt seem to know what they were doing. But they were obviously knowledgeable enough to order their mass of sushi at Sushi Taro., Not sure what the fuss is all about. I thought the sushi here was just OK. The retaurant is in my neighborhood but Ill probably look around for better sushi someplace else., Best sushi in town. Every ingredient was perfect- the avocados were perfectly ripe, the tuna was amazingly fresh, the spider roll was still warm from the tempora, but not too hot to ruin the roll. Plus they sell Nigori (Unfiltered) Sake - If you havent tried it, you should! Prices are reasonable. There is American and Traditional Japaneses tables., The host here wrote my name down in Japanese. We waited half an hour on a Saturday, and it was more than worth it.All the fish we had was excellent. The tempura is light and airy, sashimi and nigiri fresh and buttery. My bf wanted to order the kobe beef roll, and I was a bit reluctant because thats room in my stomach that could otherwise be occupied by fish. I turned, however, when it arrived at the table: seared, tender and ultrarare, wrapped in rice and a white seaweed.The lunch specials are superb as well. I had a generous and fresh share of sushi for $10!Yes, its the best sushi Ive had in DC., Ie been here about 10 times in the past year and will have to say the sushi here is pretty darn good. 8 out of 10 times after I eat here, I say to myself, this is the best sushi Ie ever had! Other times, it was just another sushi joint. Still, that pretty impressive numbers, for me. The sushi and sashimi are some of the freshest in the area. Get the toro or hamachi or albacore tuna there and they will melt in your mouth. Mmm mmm. Even the other more common fish are so fresh and tasty you would think youe eating gourmet sushi. They have specials all the time with interesting selection you would never find at most sushi joints around here. I love trying new things and this is definitely the place to do it. The hamachi-kama (Grilled Yellowtail jaw) here is the best around. They also have a good selection of grilled One of the few Japanese-owned sushi restaurants in the DC metro area, they attract many Japanese tourist who themselves compliments the food. The price is reasonable for sushi, maybe a little above average. I wouldn say it expensive. It is located in Dupont which means street parking always sucks so you have to park in the garage across the street and get it validated for $3 after you eat. The service is consistently good, but prepare for a wait no matter what day you go...it always packed.If you haven been here, you absolutely should go try it. Youl find yourself coming back for more..., Had dinner here on a Wednesday night, crowded with a wait if you dont come early. Pretty authentic in terms of staff/decorations. The place is clean. I had the sashimi omakase and the fish was very fresh. Amberjack, salmon, toro, snapper, sweet shrimp, scallops, and another fish that looked like mackerel but it wasnt. Prices are reasonable given the freshness. Yakitori was not good, very fatty pieces of meat....vendor meat is better..., Ive heard so much about this place, and I finally made it here for lunch (with Miriam W. and Eric C.) I got the sushi and sashimi combo!!! OMG!!! That was so good, the fish was so fresh!!! I think there were 3 sushi and 6 sashimi in bento box with Tempura, Gyoza and Pickles for $15. GREAT deal., The sushi is delish and the plum wine is divine, but Sushi Taro loses a star for poor service and the stairwell that serves as a waiting area. I believe it was a Wednesday when I tried this place with my best girlfriend and even then, the steps were clogged with eager diners waiting for their names to be called and to breathe a sigh of relief. Ill add that it was gratifying to stand among mostly cheerful Washingtonians instead of griping ones per usual. Hopefully thats something to say for the ambiance and not just a note to be attributed to the holiday season.Our waitresss negligence was a little perturbing but the quality of the food and drink has the ability to quell any negativity you may encounter while waiting for a table, or at your table. We started with the miso soup-- really lovely. As a matter of personal taste, I didnt care for the plum sushi, but the salmon and avocado roll is good and the ingredients are, as everyone has mentioned, noticeably the freshest. The grilled chicken and green peppers are nothing special, but nice. The plum wine is brilliant. Definitely need to give it another go to give a proper rating, but at least as far as sushi goes, I have never had better. Sushi Taro lives up to the hype, but it really had better, with all of us flocking like geese to wait in narrow corridors for supper., I really like this place. Everything is very authentic and the service has been great the two times Ive been. Great choice of appetizers.It is also very reasonably priced.This place fills up instantly when they open for dinner at 5:30pm... but I never felt rushed out the door. I will definitely go back again!!, Just thinking about Sushi Taro makes my mouth water, so I had to prepare myself before I wrote this review. There is no other restaurant in MD-VA-DC that serves sushi that is as fresh and as delicious as Sushi Taro. I had my first taste when they had their Sushi Special. I dont really remember the details, but the special offered discounted prices on all the sushis. They had a line that went around the block, and ppl were patiently waiting- they knew it was worth it. Sushi Taro doesnt jip you on their fish. Thick slices of fish on the sushi. Try the Rainbow- theres avacodo in there. Yummy. Its a pretty large restaurant, but the waiting area is just a small staircase, so be prepared to be uncomfortable for a minute. The waits can go as long as an hour on the weekend. The price is pretty steep. I have to save up a head of time if Im craving Sushi Taro. But its worth it. You know youll be spending some cash, b/c the sushis are so good, youll want more. Go if you can, you will not be disappointed., Since everybody has a similar opinion and has already opined on this restaurant, I will be brief. Its a must if you like Japanese. Its the best I found while living there. Nice atmosphere, fresh and delicious sushi and other dishes. You cannot go wrong. You must, however, make reservations and be prepared to wait., Youve read the reviews, this place is indeed amazing. The Dragon Roll and Soft Shell Crab Roll are delicious, especially for people who A. are eating sushi for first time and are scared (but you really want them to like/ try it!) B. dont want to eat anything raw (everythings cooked in these) C. like yummy things. The lines are redic especially later in the week and on the weekend. You can call in your order ahead and pick it up to take home in about a half hour though. Also, theyre closed on Sundays.This review is dedicated to my good friend, M.P., UPDATE: I went back last night -- best spanish mackerel I have ever had. Look, the fish is very good here and the rolls match up. Also, I discovered that the tempura is an excellent accompaniment to your sushi meal. Most of the waitresses are Thai, which is funny, but the place, we confirmed, is owned by Japanese, so get on down! Sushi Taro is tha shiznit!, S.Taro is much bigger than I thought. Great ambience. You will feel definitely welcomed as soon as you walk in there because almost all servers will say Irashaimase (welcome in japanese). One thing I love about eateries in Japan was this welcome shouts every time a customer shows up. It might be too loud and noisy for some people but I like this lively, cheerful greeting than just knodding...Very authentic appetizer dishes, maki rolls and good dinner menu like katsdon. Extensive sake menu (starts from $10 up to $80 bottle). I liked the fact that maki rolls are simple without any sauce, mayo or sesame seeds. If I wanted fusion fancy rolls, I would have chosen other places. Good sushi! Yakitori is great!! One skewer comes with 2 pieces of whatever you order and its only $1.75-2 ($4 for scallop and kobe beef) and this seems to be better to get as appetizer than ones from appetizer menu. Beef dishes are great! Very tender and fresh and just melts in your mouth (I rarely do meat but it was too good to just pass on).Dont come too hungry though. This isnt the place to get stuffed. Just try to enjoy something you dont get easily at other places or every day.I havent tried desserts but they looked good (someone ordered from other table). Good service but you would feel a bit uncomfortable to spend hours there because there are always people waiting.., Fabulous sushi - consistently fresh.On Friday night, the wait can be 45 mins to an hour. Put your name on the list, go down the street and get a drink next door, then come back., The sushi is great here for the east coast. Reasonably priced, but comes in small portions (compared to west coast) so order a lot!, My personal favorite among all sushi spots anywhere, not simply because youre enjoy the sashimi, nigiri, or tako, but also because of the appetizers, like the scrumptious grilled squid, or even perfectly-executed chawanmushi--never easy to find, yet prepared so wonderfully well here., My fave sushi spot in the area. Yummy food, great service. I understand why its always so busy when I go there., My fiance and I have been fairly spoiled by the abundance of excellent sushi restaurants in New York and we weren sure we find comparable ones in D.C. Our first find, Sushi Taro, was a pleasant surprise. I read the Chowhound board, crossed-referenced with Menupages...not sure why I didn think of Yelp first which has so much information as i can see now. In reading some of the reviews on the Washington Post city guide, I was a little bit bothered by the emphasis on great rolls at other places. I mean come on, if youe going to eat sushi, go for the real thing not the rolls...esp. the cooked ones.It could have been Valentine day weekend but Saturday at Sushi Taro is crazy busy. It reminds me of the lines outside of Tomoe in NYC. We waited for an hour to get a table for 2 at the bar and it was worth the wait. I tried rock fish for the first time, similar texture to amberjack. The medium fat tuna and fatty salmon was very buttery and the sweet shrimp was yummy. Sushi Taro has a great space with Japanese tables mixed in with regular tables and a super long, winding bar. I would have rated Sushi Taro higher but I waiting to see consistency., I found this place under Cheap Eats. This is my favorite restaurant in DC so far. Being half Japanese, I was pretty excited when I found out that this place was really authentic! I sick and tired of going to places owned by people that aren Japanese and having them remake our food into a crazy concoction of food nothing like our real culture.Here you can find authentic Tamago, ume sushi, yakitori, and delicious hokogai. I highly recommend this place. VERY AUTHENTIC! The sake bombs aren too shabby either =), I like it. I think Il come here often.My boyfriend and I paid a visit to Sushi Taro for my birthday. I made the poor decision to sit in the Japanese Style seating area, but only because of my own lack of traditional Japanese Style seating. You see, being from the Midwest, our Japanese Style seating includes a hole in the floor where you place your legs. Yeah...they don have that here. It was an even worse decision considering that I was wearing low rise jeans...thank god for the cardigan. So, let this be a lesson to you all...otherwise your fellow diners will be experiencing some plumber crack with their maki. Other than the awkward seating arrangements, everything was spectacular. I love that I can get tempura a la carte as I really enjoy tasty fried veggies. The sushi was also very nice, with a great selection of rolls featuring both sea creatures and vegetables. Our waitress was great, and she even noticed that it was my birthday when we ordered our drinks. I received surprise green tea ice cream when we finished our sushi! Unfortunately I was so full that it was hard to finish it all. It was nice to experience such good service at a restaurant that is reasonably priced (for sushi). The atmosphere was great as well; it set up so that there are a lot of nooks and crannies, so it seems like you get a fairly intimate setting no matter where you are (except at the bar, of course). This would be a fun place to go on a first date, or any time you feel like stuffing your face with sushi goodness. Just make sure that you have clean socks and a belt if youe sitting on the floor., Great for a date. I would recommend going on Wednesday night for the happy hour special.FYI: I was a bit saddened that they didnt have Sapporo but Kirin is just as good. Other than that the spider rolls, alaskan, california were great! Even better the next day :), Just throwing in my 2 cents because you dont need me to tell you this place is delicious. The nigiri just melted in your mouth...especially the fatty tuna and fatty salmon.We went as a group with someone Japanese who did all the ordering in Japanese, which added to the already authentic feel of the restaurant. Like other reviewers here, it was important to her that the staff and kitchen in sushi joints are actually Japanese.As the best clue of how good this place is --- we went on 6:30pm on a Monday and the place was packed., I love this place. Easily the best sushi Ive had in D.C. (I might say ever, but living on the west coast I ate some really, really good sushi).I dont have much to contribute that hasnt already been said: it is a great deal, very fresh, wide selection, fabulous wait staff, worth the wait, etc. You can make reservations but not after 6 PM (I think) if you want to avoid a wait.Well be back for sure., I cant believe I waited so long to try Sushi Taro! Everything was delicious. The tempura, the yakitori, the sashimi and nigiri, the rolls! Service was also excellent. The best part? It wont break your wallet. =), I went there with some local friends while on a biz trip. Initially, I was not very impressed from outside while waiting (and its name sounds cheesy too)... but I was SO wrong. It definitely was worth the wait. I had their vegetarian sushi combo. It certainly was one of the best (or probably only) vegetarian sushi. Rather than trying to imitate fish, the chef took a different approach to try to find vegetables, roots, and mushrooms with the right texture and taste that would go well with the sushi rice. That was definitely a 5 star dish. We then had crme brulee, well, it good, but not too impressive. We were seated in a smaller room rather than the big hall. It was therefore a bit quiter, but the people sitting next to us (definitely tourists) gave us weird looks when we talked about controversial issueslike being out at work... I guess that means the space may be a bit too cramped then?, What is wrong with everyone? I can believe I was excited about this place.....I know....all this Yelp hype!!!!Il start with the best thing...their King Crab and Salmon Cream Croquette was absolutely the best I have ever eaten!! Everything else was mediocre and it took FOREVER! We waited and waited and waited...Ie never waited so long for sushi. Good thing we had a table of 8 plus an infant to entertain ourselves.My little tummy was telling me more! so I tried to order some Udon. Cold or Hot Udon...............................................$9.50 (wait there more)Fried Tofu, Tempura Batter, Wakame seaweed, or raw egg.......$1.00Chicken, Tempura, or Grated yam....................................................$2.00All I wanted was a vegetarian Udon and the waiter refused to do it!! Ginger kindly asked, can you just put some vegetables in? Waitress laughingly replies, Ummm...hehehehe.....no. Ginger thoughts, grab her, grab her, grab her hair, grab her arms, grab her anything and shake this dumb girl!To prevent a scene and being a bad influence to the baby, I smiled and ordered the Wakame seaweed which I tried to finish out of frustration., Dont miss the spicy tuna roll! This is the best spicy tuna maki roll in DC. It melts in your mouth.Also dont miss:-The specialty rolls, including the fantastic rainbow and dragon rolls.-The desserts. These change daily, but try to catch the fruit tart if you can! Its divine.-Tuna nigiri.-Sitting at the bar - you get to see all the chefs at work as they make these beautiful creations.-Getting there early or making reservations way in advance - weekend dinner spots can fill up days in advance!Fresh fish, friendly service, convenient location, loyalty to return customers. Crowded but worth it. I think I have been here about 15 times., Food is consistently great and adventurous, one of the few japanese owned and run sushi restaurants in the greater DC area. Only problem I have is the long and disorganized way they seat people. If they were more efficient with their seating they could probably squeeze in alot more customers. The servers are nice and try their best. Id definitely recommend if you dont mind waiting during the weekends. They make you wait even if you have reservations!, This is my favorite sushi place in DC (am going to Makoto tonight so maybe it will get replaced?!), hands down. I just love the atmosphere with all of the busy sushi bar seats, and the quality of the fish itself is just unbeaten. My rule of thumb is to order uni (sea urchin) at a sushi restaurant and that pretty much holds up the highest end of fish you could have at any given sushi place, I think. If you have sweet, fresh uni, you must be a pretty good sushi restaurant. And Sushi Taro passes this test. I usually order a la carte but sometimes supplement with stuff from the grill, or even the huge oden soup on the appetizer menu. They take reservations between very specific hours and for a specific number of parties, so if bringing a date, I would just go around 6 or 8:30 and wait about 15 to 20 minutes for a seat., Given the expected wait due to Sushi Taros Cherry Blossom Weekend Special, I opted for the takeout option yesterday, and was not disappointed. I ordered yellowtail with scallion maki, salmon maki, amberjack (kampachi) nigiri, and bonito (katsuo) nigiri. The maki was terrific, with just the right ratio of fish to rice. The amberjack was soft like butter, and the bonito was very good (though a bit overpowered by an extra helping of wasabi). With respect to the amberjack & bonito, this was the first time that Id eaten either outside of Asia, and kudos to Sushi Taro for introducing these less common options to the DC palate.5 stars for the food, no comment on service(takeout), I confess: Im a bit of a sushi snob. I live in San Francisco and have been extremely spoiled by the sushi places there. According to my DC friends, DC sushi is average at best, but they had heard good things about this place, and convinced me to go.After about an hour wait (they at least take your number and call you when the table is ready so you can go next door and grab a drink), we were seated at our table in a small, private room.The sushi menu is nothing spectacular--its very basic in terms of selection. You can find all the typical nigiri and sushi roll combos that youd expect to find anywhere else. They did have abalone (they were out), orange clam (also out), boston mackeral (out again) and rock fish (bingo!) on the menu, so there is some variety. We ended up ordering mackeral, uni, rockfish and scallop nigiri--all were extremely fresh and wonderful. The uni was as buttery as it comes, and melted in our mouths. Yakatori were smaller portions, and while they didnt come out flaming hot, we were happy with the chicken skin, chicken gizzard and quail egg yakatoris that we ordered.What sets this restaurant apart, however, is its extensive menu of non-sushi items. For this, I was glad to have gone with 3 other people so that we could sample from the appetizer and yakatori menu. Some things we tried:Flounders fin meat with grated raddish and ponzu--this is kind of raw but very refreshing. Make sure to eat w/the raddish as it totally accentuates the flavorsDeep fried smelt marinated in sweet vinegar: this was kind of not what i expected. I thought the smelt would have been marinated first, then fried so that it was crisp, however, it was fried first, then marinated in vinegar so that it was soggy. Not bad, not overwhelmingly greatBlack cod marinated in sweet sake paste: smaller portion, but very flavorful, melt-in-your-mouth yummyspanish mackeral marinated in sweet miso paste: I love the firmness of mackeral, and found this more unique and flavorful than the black cod.japanese fried chicken: at first we thought this chicken was going to be a bit overfried...and where was the hot mustard? However, after biting into the crisp outer shell, the steaming hot chicken juices spilled out. It seems as if the hot mustard flavor was incorporated into the breading for the chicken. So simple, but so good. beef tripe with vegetables in miso flavor: I ordered this because i was curious. It is surprisingly good--the texture of the tripe is more like fried tofu, and combined w/the miso sauce broth, kind of reminded us of pizza. Strangely satisfying.agedashi tofu--extremely flavorful broth, and extremely satisfying. Only thing that could have made it better was a fried shiso on the top.off the specials menu, we had little neck clams with a fresh shitake mushroom and vegetable broth. The clams were good, but we found ourselves using our spoons to drink up the flavorful broth.The standout of the night was a dish that made us both laugh and have a foodgasm it was that good: Buta Kakuni or Braised Korobuta pork belly in sweet soy sauce with mustard. The fattiness and tenderness of the pork were perfectly accentuated by the spicy hot mustard. Of all the dishes we had, I think we were in agreement that this is the dish we would return to eat time and time again. Overall, very very good sushi, especially given a town that has apparently limited sushi options. But more than a fresh sushi menu, Sushi Taro goes above and beyond ordinary by offerering up some hard-to-find japanese dishes., 3.5I like Sushi Taro for a few reasons. Of course, the fish is fresh tasting, but I mostly like that they have a lot of small dishes and starters. A lot of places are sushi joints rather than Japanese restaurants. The nigiri fish was cut really thick, almost too thick. Youd think Id like it thick. Anyway, I had the tempura and teriyaki skewers to start then some rolls and nigri. Yes, I order entirely too much. I would note that its pretty traditional and there are not many futomaki on the menu. So if youre looking for crazy nuveau rolls, then this isnt the place for you.Overall, I will definitely go again. However, parking is a b*tch, so I advise taking the metro.
64|tadich-grill-washington|Attended one of their several soft openings last evening and I think this restaurant will be a massive success. Service was attentive and informative. Decor was simple and very reminiscent of the West coast. I highly recommend the Coney Island chowder, the crab cakes, and the lamb. All were fantastic! Ill definitely be back to try their signature seafood stew and more from their raw bar. Try one of their signature cocktails - the old fashioned was perfect. Tadich will be one of the best options on Pennsylvania Avenue!, Being fans of San Francisco historic Tadich Grill, and being on vacation, we had to try the spinoff.We found out that they are very new, formerly opening this week. The mesquite grill was not up and running yet, however the pan-fried Chilean sea bass was excellent.The wine list is very well appointed with both Californian and East Coast wines. They aim to impress in general, but specifically with the wine list, and they did. Not bad for a fish house. We had a very nice Rancho Zabaco Zinfandel from the California Dry Creek valley. It was medium body, smooth with nice pepper overtones.The flown-in San Francisco-baked Boudin French bread flows. You have to literally stop the waiter from bringing more. The Caesar salad featured white anchovies, nice Parmesan cheese, and very fresh Romaine lettuce.The white-jacketed waiter and wait staff was very much *there*. He took good care of us, and carefully informed us of the newer menu items that we might not be familiar with from our experiences at San Francisco original 1849 location. All this, when we had just walked in from a rain and wind deluge that had caught us while walking from the far side of the Capitol Mall. We had umbrellas, but we were still partially soaked. No one batted an eye. People around us had on much more formal attire than we Left Coasters are used to, but, nevertheless, we seemed to fit right in.The dining areas have both stand-alone tables and bar seating. Some tables are enclosed in mahogany-walled dining areas that help you concentrate on your dining companions rather than people-watch. I recommend both Tadich Grills for your future dining experiences. Enjoy here or in San Francisco!, Great new bar and restaurant downtown. The lobster roll is to die for, loved the prime rib, scallops, and the endive appetizer. The bar staff are very friendly. Great place to stop in for a drink and dinner., great new spot. bartenders are wonderful--ask michael flanigan to sing you a song! food is good--not the best seafood ive ever had--but good., Extraordinary food, top service and endearing decor that transports you to the venerable original in San Francisco. This is Californias oldest restaurant, magically transported to give Washingtonians its incomparable cioppino, sourdough bread, unusual oyster stew, beautifully broiled fish and Dungeness crab cocktails that are so worth the price. Oh, and the Crab Louis salad. Our party of five was in heaven. Pick anything on the menu -- its top-flight. So grateful it is here and that reservations are possible. S.F. diners line up two deep nightly behind the lucky eaters at the long marble dining bar and wait for an opening!, The food is absolutely delish! I had garlic potatoes, clams and the saut39ed sea scallops. The French martini and Bloody Mary are also good. The waiters are so attentive and warm, especially Djoko!!! Will definitely come back., A bit disappointing and I am a fan of the San Fran location. Food was great but very pricey. Didnt feel like the value was there for what you pay. Ordered two cocktails including a Grey Goose Cosmo which was not made well. I didnt drink it. Was told it would be removed from the bill but it was not. The other drink ordered was not what was ordered and was served essentially in a shot glass. Odd. Service was friendly but slow and not attentive. Took forever for the drinks, the wine and the food to be served. Ordered raw oysters on the half shell - outstanding. Two entrees were the Chesapeake Seafood Stew and the Cioppino - both were delicious. Food was great but not likely to return given the cost., Had lunch here and it was great. The regular menu is quite pricey, but the lunch menu has lots of choices for under $20. The standout was the Cioppino, with a large amount of perfectly cooked fish and shellfish in a tasty tomato-based broth. The caramel cake and the carrot cake were both good - sweet but not cloying. One of the truly amazing things about the restaurant is how the servers are so professional, knowledgeable, and smooth that it seems like theyve been there for decades - - but the restaurant has only been open for a few weeks. How the heck did they do that? This is a winner all the way around., I really wish I would have found this place on Thursday. I would have eaten here every day. The cioppino is the most amazing dish ever. Fantastic service without a doubt. Sokol thank you for the recommendation! Loved it!, Last night we were blown away by the friendly, professional, experienced staff and most of all by the delicious food. This place is only a few weeks old in DC and we found it on Open Table and knew instantly the menu choices were to our liking. And once we were actually ready to choose it became a difficult task indeed. My Cioppino ( seafood stew) and my husbands swordfish were outstanding. Highly recommend this new find. I wish they were in Philly my home town. Marcia, Food and service were both outstanding. Since McCormick & Schmicks downward spiral, I have been searching for a great seafood restaurant and I have found it. I will definitely be returning., Eaten here on two different occasions. As a fan of seafood and a long time pescatarian Im always looking for good places for non-land-based food eating. Would that I could say this was it but while I know Cioppino is the russian roulette of seafood dining experiences I expected here it would be better when in fact it was much worse. Sorry. For the price? Better places to go., Had no idea about their troubles recently. But I went here before the news broke. The manager is fantastic, everyone was friendly, I came opening weekend so there were of course some kinks to be worked out. I got the cioppino which was great! There was a bib and all. We had a bottle of wine and my friend got a steak with fixing. The mesquite grill flavor really made the difference in the steak. WOW! I never had something so flavorful based off of the cooking method. I must try this in the future. We also got the spinach - it was okay nothing exciting. The shrimp cocktail was just small shrimp nothing spectacular. The calamari was indeed calamari... but what made it good was the cocktail sauce., Tadich Grill has the most delicious food you can imagine! The seafood was awesome. The seating in personal booths makes this restaurant very romantic and intimate.The entire staff including the managers, owners, Maitre d, and servers show the highest amount of professionalism. This restaurant is the perfect place to go in Washington,D.C. The desserts are also scrumptious!, My coworkers (party of four African Americans) for lunch for the tadich grill the first day they began serving lunch and were a little leary when we arrived at the door and no one greeted us. We waited and finally were greeted and seated by one of the waiters. They put us at the front door as well as the other African Americans they put at the front door on the other side of the bar. The ambience in the room reminded me of the good ole boys. If they dont want this cloud over their establishment then they need to clean up their act and refresh the atmosphere (music, greet all customers, etc) as the entrees we had were good., The food is AMAZING!!!!!! Had the Cioppino. Very fresh ingredients, tons of seafood tomato based with a little spicy kick. So yummy. Sour dough bread like San Fran. Excellent service everyone very attentive. It is a little of a splurge, but life is short. Eat well., Had dinner here last Saturday evening to celebrate a friends birthday. Tadich was an excellent dining experience. Great drinks, food, service. Stevie, my waitress, was absolutely WONDERFUL - funny too. She actually made the experience quite memorable. I will be returning to Tadich real soon - like next weekend. As a man of color, I found NOTHING racist about Tadich. Great everything!!!, Most excellent!! Being a fan of the SF location, this was a huge treat!! Love that they kept the theme of the original location. Often times, you go to a satellite restaurant and it just isnt the same, however, it was just as good in DC. The sea bass was wonderful as was the cioppino which is my husbands favorite. Will definitely return., Very close to service and quality of Tadich s in San Francisco. Good experience sitting at the bar. The Portuguese Fish stew, recommended by the bartender was delicious. Drinks well made. Good wine list. Overall a superb dining experience., Nothing special. Crabcakes had too much breading for my liking and cocktails were a bit watered down. My salad was decent but its a salad, cant really mess that up. For the prices I expected much more. Doubt Ill return., This place is gorgeous and only a 5 minute walk from metro center! Delectable crab cake, tasty wine selection and a very well dressed and professional staff. I came here by chance and really had an amazing time killing an hour before going to the national mall.Next time it will certainly not be by chance., After a week on the Hill I have to say this is the best choice Ive made for defrag lunch in DC. Amazing Ciappino ., Absolutely wonderful service! After walking around and sight seeing all morning, we were ready to head home but wanted a light bite. Stepped in for appetizers and a drink - it was my daughters 7th birthday. The entire staff was fantastic! They treated my daughter like a little princess and sang to her and were just all around sincerely friendly. Will definitely go back for dinner and/or drinks. The pleasant atmosphere and wonderful staff made this place divine! Thank you :), A friend said to meet at 11am on a Friday. But it wasnt opened yet; it opens at 11:30am. However, the host opens the doors and let us sit early. He even let us order coffee. He was very friendly and the people that worked there were clearly happy and enjoyable BG their job. I got a cappuccino and it was very good. For lunch I got the Fried Oyster Caesar salad. OMG the oysters wet so good. They were still hot. He breading was crunchy and the oyster inside juicy. There was a little too much dressing on the salad. But otherwise it was perfect. The cheese was great. Id like to come back here., Wonderful Seafood Addition to DC. A Step back in time with professional bar keeps that treat you like regular from the moment you walk in. Amazing happy hour weekdays 4-7 and Saturdays 11:30-7pm.Wonderful offerings. I had cup of Cioppino. Coming for Happy Hour Dark & Stormy or Old-Fashioned $6.00 till 7pm at the bar.I will be back to sit down for whole menu dinner in cozy booth for date night or meal with friends. Great to have Tadich in DC!, The San Francisco Sourdough bread, flown in each morning I was told, is enough to make me a repeat customer. A big chunk of their excellent bread was served before our meal.We were in DC on business and decided to eat lunch also. Our lunch bill for 2 was about $75 that included 3 alchoholic drinks that averaged $10 each. But whats the fun in dining w/o proper chasers. LOL! We did not have an appetizer or dessert. Still we left with a ToGo box. My fried trout was perfect and so was the popcorn shrimp. Both meals came with a pile of shoestring french fries and string beans cooked and seasoned just right. I hate it when restaurants serve string beans that were dunked briefly in a pot of water (barely blanched) and is more raw than done. On the other hand, I dont like them overdone either. These were perfect, no joke. Okay, thats one of my pet peeves, the crunchy, raw string beans thing. Our waiter was very professional. I lost our receipt so I dont know his name. He asked in advance if this was a leisurely lunch or not to determine the pacing. Excellent! All leisure for us so he did not rush us even when the place got fuller. We were there when the doors opened at 11:30AM, our business appointment taking less time than we allowed. Find a reason to treat yourself to a meal at this fine establishment. After all, we save money by not having to fly to the west coast to do so. Thats my logic anyway and Im sticking to it. :-), Being on an endless quest for great cioppino, I had to visit while in DC to see if this edition stood up to the original. It was every bit as good, but I found it to be much more friendly. We had a slightly bad experience in SF with the seating process, but when I came back here for a second night I was greeted like a long time regular. The cioppino was perfect and quite large; well worth the price of $34. Tonight I had the calamari steak and Coney Island clam chowder: both were outstanding! I dont think Ill eat anywhere else. The menu is huge and the service top notch., The Chesapeake seafood stew is easily one of the best things Ive ever eaten. The cioppino is phenomenal as well, and probably what theyre best known for. The chopped salad with chicken is perfection if youre a big fan of bleu cheese. I have to admit, I was not very impressed by their pan fried chilean sea bass, and would recommend sticking to the house specialties. I really enjoyed the seafood curry, but in all honesty, everything pales in comparison to their cioppinos/stews. The servers are all very attentive and friendly, and really add the the experience. I cant wait to go back., Jumbo lump crab cocktail and crab grilled cheese sandwich were amazing. The cioppino was possibly the best thing I have ever had. No kids menu but they quickly whipped up some pasta for our rowdy 2 year old. Not cheap but worth every penny ($160 lunch with tip)., I love the SFO original so I really want this place to succeed. Have been three times. Two dinners and one lunch with a client. First time was shortly after opening and they hit on all cylinders. Great service and food. Second was a lunch with friends. Friends who I kept telling how great the place was. Food was ok but service was so bad I let the manager know. Order was forgotten then after second time brought out wrong. Sent back and was practically thrown the food when it came out correctly. Third time had same server as number two. Ugh. My client had to ask me if he was ever going to take our order. Food made up for rocky service. I will go back a few more times out of loyalty to the original but a few of the wait staff should go back to Applebees. Mixed results 3, Probably some of the worst service Ive ever had at a restaurant, which is saying something because Ive experienced some bad service in DC restaurants. We went into Tadich at 7:45 pm. By 8:15, not one server came over to ask me if us wanted a drink or food. To make it even worse, we were sitting at the bar. I literally watched 5 (yea, FIVE) different servers/bartenders walk by us countless times without one stopping and asking if we wanted anything. Eventually, we had to flag someone down to ask for a drink menu. We finally order some drinks and an appetizer (shrimp and lump crab cocktail) and have to wait another 15 minutes before we get either. The drinks were ok, but the crab in the cocktail we received wasnt lump, it was clearly claw meat. On top of that, every single bite had a piece of shell in it. The only person that was worth anything in this place was Anetta, the manager. She was the only person there that actually seemed to care that we literally waited 45 minutes for nothing. Oh, and did I mention that a server flipped us the bird (TWICE) when we were waiting to be seated because we said we liked a different basketball team than he did? Yeah, highly doubt Ill ever step foot in here again., Lunch visit. I sat at the long bar close to the window with a view of the kitchen. The sour dough bread was sliced right in front of me and, with its crisp crust, served as the perfect accompaniment to the creamy lobster bisque. The bisque was rich in flavor and had plenty of lumps of sweet lobster. The crispy fried oyster Caesar salad was just the right amount of everything. The six large oysters were still hot even though they were sitting on a chilled bed of lettuce. The sliced anchovies on top were a nice touch and very fresh (tasted almost like they were just caught and cleaned to order). While I sat there near the kitchen, I must have heard half a dozen orders called out for the crab grilled cheese sandwich. Ill be trying that next time., Excellent Louie Salads. Friendly staff and service time okay, but not the most efficient or attentive. Pan prepared dishes are very oily. Crispy Calamari is delicious. Cocktails are a bit off proportion-wise, but wine is top rate. Loud atmosphere, but great design. Delicious desserts., Went here for lunch. Great space. Warm bread and butter to start was very fresh and tasty. I had the Steak Oscar Lump Crab with Asparagus, mash potatoes, and hollandaise sauce. Delicious steak, a bit over sauced in my opinion.Had the bread pudding for dessert. I asked if it had raisins and was told yes. I was NOT told that it also came with nuts, strawberries, blueberries and blackberries!!! and a caramel cream sauce.... You would think they would tell you this was not a normal bread pudding. Ever heard of nut allergies? good thing I don suffer from it. The dessert was supposed to be warmed, but only the cream sauce was warm. Tasty, but wasn what I was expected., Came here for a lunch recently with a good friend and the experience was great. Our server was friendly, attentive and provided great service. We both had entree salads and had so much food I took half to go for later. I work right around the corner and will be back for sure!, Its crazy deliciousness!!! Chose the stew and its rocking my heart out!! It has the most creamy sauce. Theres shrimp crab cake scallops rock fish. All the ingredients for a great rainy day. Except its not rainy. I will definitely try the one in SF. Ive eaten out a lot of different places but I had exceptional fun here, Chris and the people in this restaurant are really friendly and treat you like family. Lovely place and I will be back real soon!!, I went for my birthday dinner with my parents over the weekend and had an absolutely amazing experience. It was our first time to Tadich, and we asked to be seated out front by the bar so we could be near the windows, which the staff happily obliged. While the main restaurant was pretty full, there was almost no one out by the bar, and the bartender acted as our server. He answered our multitude of questions about the menu with a smile and jokes, and everything came out wonderfully. We started with ceasar salads and the fritto misto. The Ceasars were very flavorful and had a clearly excellently homemade dressing with fresh anchovies added to the salad. The fritto misto was excellent as well, with everything lightly breaded and fried perfectly to allow the flavor of each item to come through without overpowering. The shrimp were the stand out in my opinion in that dish, as they were large and juicy under the breading, with a slight old bay flavor.As for mains, two of us got the artic char pan fried, which was done perfectly with a nice sauce and vegetables and potatoes on the side. Its a good size piece of fish and nice amount of food. One of us got the dunggeness crab cakes, and they were definitely a hit as well. We finished off sharing the strawberry shortcake, which was large and flavorful as well, with two large homemade biscuits, cream, and a bunch of cut strawberries.We had a wonderful experience and will definitely be back again soon!, Not too bad on the food but the politics might be a little off but Buich isnt an owner anymore apparently.We had the scallops and fried rainbow trout...both very tasty meals.We have been there before and the service is never bad., Great old restaurant for seafood. Service was fantastic, and I would recommend this place to anyone that is looking for a great place to eat., This is by far my favorite restaurant in DC. They have wonderful, FRESH seafood from both the East and West coasts. The service is always the best! Our last trip we decided to eat our way through the appetizer menu. Everything was FANTASTIC!, Mediocre food that in no way justifies the high prices here. Ie eaten here twice and would not go back a third time. The first dish I tried was the Petrale Sole, which I guess comes from the West Coast. It was just OK, served with OK string beans and Long Branch potatoes, which are just steak fries by another name. The second time I had scallops and shrimp creole. The scallops were tough and tasted rancid, the promised large shrimp/prawns turned out to be only small bay shrimp, which I had told the waiter explicitly I did not want. He assured me it would come with large shrimp/prawns but that was not the case. I should have sent it back. Even though I let them know the food was not good, the bill was not adjusted. Way overpriced and mediocre food -- I would never waste my money there again and would not recommend it to anyone., We showed up for our reservation on Friday night at 6:30, and you could shoot a cannon through the place. The wait person who seated us was funny and said that he had given our table away....We were seated and then Brigette showed up. She was one of the best wait persons we have ever enjoyed. Here service was impeccable and the way she dealt with my indecision was experienced. I asked her what was wrong with the place that few were there, and she responded that Fridays are usually not the busy nights. She allayed my concerns that we were in for a marginal meal and everyone in DC knew that but us!Were we ever surprised! My wifes crab and shrimp Louie was spectacular and my Portuguese Stew was mouth watering and filling to boot. The SF sourdough bread is to die for, as well as the carrot cake. Brigette made what was already an excellent meal truly enjoyable and memorable., We are from Arizona on vacation. My friends and I wanted great seafood. We found this place and glad that we did. The crab cakes were 10 out of 10! Also the calamari steak and fried halibut were amazing. I would definitely come back here for my seafood cravings., Excellent place to stop by for a quick brew and coffee on a pleasant summer day. Superb music and beverage (beer/wine/the hard stuff) selection, and very friendly wait staff. Will definitely return in the future for more good times., I havent been to a tadich grill since we moved from CA 20 years ago, but when I found there was one in DC I was determined to go and we did. We had wine and calamari at the bar and they were delicious. At the table my wife had scallops and creamed spinach. I tasted both and my wife says they were delicious which I agree whole heartedly. I had my all time favorite the pan fried sand dabs and they were just as I remembered them - excellent and delicious. I wont hesitate to recommend then as I always have. You cant go wrong coming here., I went to this restaurant recently with a friend of mine. I had a reservation and we were quickly seated. Our waiter quickly came to our table for our drink order and to ask if we had any questions.For an appetizer, we chose crabcakes. There were two types of crabcakes. Surprisingly, we both thought the Pacific crab was better than the Maryland crab.For the main course, my friend chose the Chesapeake seafood stew and I ordered the cioppino. My friend said she thought her Chesapeake stew was a little too salty and after tasting it, i agreed with her. The cioppino was excellent, which, upon tasting it, my friend agreed.The service was excellent as our waiter was very attentive. He was definitely a professional.I will definitely try to return the next time I am in Washington., Tadich has it all over Hanks Grill. We sat outside and received amazing service from Bridget. The fried oysters, Mini lobster rolls, soft shall crab entree and even the side mixed greens were all excellent. This will be my go to place in DC. Worth the $$$., Nice recreation of a treasured SF institution. Food was tasty and the inclusion of good sourdough and steam beer made me feel at home. Lively staff. I hope it gets it lunch going and that people flock to it., Loved he one in SF and loved this one too. Great food, great ambiance, great bar and bartender from NY. Great place overall!, Excellent!Chesapeake stew is out of this world.Bridgette took amazing care of us and guided us through the menu including what to order and how much food was too much., Very good! Amazing service with our server Bridgette. Drinks were great. Seafood was fresh and prepared perfectly. This was as good as the original in San Francisco.., I patronized their original restaurant in San Francisco since 1985. I was glad to find out that they opened their first outpost on the east cost right here in DC.I was hoping that the DC location would have the same quality of seafood. They do! We had a fantastic dinner. The sourdough bread was delicious. The crust was crispy and the inside was doughy. My crab meat cocktail was very good. My wife started with soup.I ordered Cioppino, WOW thats all I will say! My wife got perfectly grilled red snapper.The wine list is limited but I found a good Pino Noir.We will be back!, Our server was phenomenal. She was constantly checking on us, making sure our drinks were refilled and that we were satisfied with our food. I ordered the snapper, while my aunt ordered the seafood curry casserole. We left satisfied., Rounding up from 4.5 stars.Tadich Grill can be pricey, but its a gem if you want to experience expertly prepared American seafood with a retro twist. Order carefully and you can enjoy an excellent meal at a reasonable price.The setting at the Tadich is paneled and clubby, with low lighting and large booths. There is also outdoor seating on Pennsylvania Avenue in good weather-- our choice on a mild summer evening.The menu at the Tadich Grill may seem plain at first perusal, but it consists of classic recipes honed at the Tadich since the mid-19th century. From our experience, the restaurant knows how to fry: fried food emerges crisp, light and non-greasy. Our meal was expertly prepared and delicious. Portions are ample.  -Our Rhode Island frito misto appetizer was beautifully fried and flavored, and would make a hearty and satisfying meal for one with the addition of a side vegetable. As an app, it readily and amply feeds two. -The broiled swordfish is perfectly cooked with a hint of smokiness from the grill. Exceptionally satisfying. (The menu describes the fish as broiled, but it tastes grilled.) -The sand dabs (a San Francisco classic) are a must: delicate white fish, lightly breaded and fried, with a lemon butter sauce. Ask for extra sauce. Heaven.  -The bread, a loaf of white sourdough, is exceptional and worth every carb. While the loaf is sturdy, it somehow retains lightness. The sourdough flavor is subtle-- just enough to impart an intriguing tang, This is world class bread, proprietary to Tadich Grill, that deserves its heirloom status. -The vegetables that accompanied our entrees were straightforward: green beans with chunks of carrot. We expected to be bored, but the vegetables were impeccably fresh and perfectly cooked. The thick frites were square cut: very good, if falling short of greatness. All in all, the side dishes at the Tadich could be a bit more imaginative, but their very plainness imparts a classic Americana of the early to mid-20th century.The Tadichs wine list tilts toward the expensive (although certainly not more than at other upscale Pennsylvania Avenue eateries), but is thoughtfully chosen and provides several bottles in the $40-$45 range.Our waiter was brusque at first, but warmed up when we told him how much we were enjoying our meal. The runner who delivered our food couldnt have been more solicitous. Our busser, Trini, was kind and accommodating. Overall, service is attentive and polished.If you are searching for expertly prepared, classic American seafood, the Tadich Grill is worth a visit., Having lived for a long time in the San Francisco Bay Area, I was looking forward to a meal at the newer east coast outpost of this SF institution. Sadly was disappointed. The food was adequate but the prices were very high for small portions of seafood; wine prices were just as inflated. The service was painfully slow - and the place was not that busy, so I suspect they just did not pay to have enough staff on hand to cover the diners who were there. The front of house is large and rather cold, unlike the SF restaurant which is always bustling and has a cozy feel. Overall it felt forced and I was let down. Also had a terrible case of heartburn overnight, not sure what in my rather plain meal would have caused that. I think the place has potential but needs perhaps a dose of humility. DC is not San Fran., Bridgette was my server and she was just fabulous! She was so kind and always on top of everything! The food was also to die for!!!! I got the filet mignon and it was one of the best pieces of meat Ive ever eaten! I highly recommend dining at this restaurant and ask for Bridgette if you want the best experience!!, Our wonderful neighbor suggested Tadich as shed been there and knew it as a well known San Francisco restaurant. She was more than right. The food is delicious and the service above par. We shared the lobster rolls as an appetizer -- three mini rolls stuffed with absolutely delicious lobster salad which no doubt was Main lobster. I had the lump crab cakes for my entree and have to say Im still raving. They were served with fries and the best spinach Ive had in years. My two friends had coppino which was wonderful -- filled with seafood, delicious tomato sauce and chanks of bread. Our waitress -- Bridget -- is wonderful. She was helpful, full of personality and knew what we needed before we asked. I definitely recommend this restaurant. The specials are priced above $30 each and our mini lobster rolls were $18. Its not an inexpensive dinner, but worth the splurge., Very disappointed with the food and overall restaurant. I ordered off their restaurant week menu. I had the lobster bisque, pan fried trout, desert and wine. First there several bugs/nats dying around, while one flew into my wine glass. More importantly the lobster bisque was sub par, the trout merely average, and miserly portioned desert not much better. With all to choose from in the city, I would never recommend this place., We visited Tadic Grill for lunch has part of restaurant week. We were seated right away in a 4 top for 5. not a fan of looking in the mirror for my whole meal but whatever. The sourdough bread was delicious. Best Ive had outside SF. We ate off the restaurant week menu. I had the mixed green salad with the Louie dressing on the side, popcorn shrimp and ice cream. My other dining companions had the Lobster Bisque, Boston Calm Chowder, Hamburger, and the seafood specials. The only complaints I heard were that the bread pudding was two sweet and the frosting on the carrots cake was too sweet. I would like to go back for a few items on the regular menu., Hosted a 31-person business event/dinner at the Tadich Grill. Aneta, the private dining manager at Tadich, was fantastic and was able to guide us through the food and beverage selections during the planning process. She and her staff professionally and effortlessly carried us through our evening; the food, wine, and service was all fantastic. Strongly recommend for business/corporate events.
65|tail-up-goat-washington|Absolutely incredible!! Super pleasant, happy staff that were very knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. The stracciatella was fresh and bright. Ill be back for ALL of the homemade pastas! The maltagliati with honey sausage and pea-shoots was a favorite, the smoked rutabaga ravioli also wonderful. Honestly though, Ill be back for the smokin hot blond manager walking around. A bunch of people were getting hugs, cant wait to become a regular, maybe Ill get one of those hugs :) Really, really recommend., Tail Up Goat is owned by Chef Jon Sybert, Jill Tyler, and Bill Jenson, who brings a history of working at Komi and Little Serow (REAL TALK: I was actually pretty excited to check this place out because of the cute name and the cute little sheep/goat picture that they had). The menu has a good variety, offering menus such as crispy salt cod, grilled quail, lamb ribs, smoked hen of the woods shroom, and desserts, such as roasted pineapple float. They also have a nice variety of drinks, ranging from cocktails to wines. ADRIENNE M. and I came here to check them out on their first night of opening, so I was just beside myself! :D We tried: the Crispy Salt Cod (little mini cod croquettes with smoked cauliflower puree and pickled red onions - this was plated so cutely, and the little bites were pretty tasty - not too fishy, had a good cod taste to each of them, a little crispy on the outside, and great with the smoked cauliflower puree and the pickled onions); the Grilled Rabbit Sausage (came on mini skewers with fennel mostarda and marinated radicchio; these were grilled and charred perfectly; the sausages were pretty tasty with the hint of spices and probably my preferred way of eating rabbit!); the Charred Chocolate Rye (this came with a plate of a salt-crusted sardine (a sardine set on top of a salt bed), butter from Trickling Springs, and some pickled tomatoes; the tomatoes were a bit too pickle-y for me, but I loved the creaminess of the butter on the rye; the rye was super crispy, as think of it as overdone toast - it was super charred; I actually ate the sardine on its own, and it was flaky, light, and delicious); Braised Carrots (contained sticky garlic and honeycomb, this a lot of peppercorns and Vietnamese spices going on; the different types of carrots were cooked all the way through, but I didnt really care much for this one); Stracciatella (housemade smooth mozzarella which is similar to burrata in texture, this was absolutely delicious! It had a nice citrus lemon olive oil drizzled on top and came with a side of thinly-sliced radishes and apples; very light and fresh!); the Maltagliati (loose triangular-shaped pasta with fermented honey sausages and pea shoots; the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, and the honey sausage was crumbled and had a nice crispy exterior - delicious!); the Smoked Rutabaga Ravioli (with ground gingerbread on top with basil mint pesto; this was a bit too heavy on the basil taste, but those who are basil fans will love this; ravioli was cooked perfectly, too!); the Smoked Hen of the Woods Mushroom (with burnt bread sauce and chicken crisps, the mushrooms had a nice meaty taste to them, but still light, and I really liked the chicken skin crisps!); and, the Lamb Ribs (with sumac onions and beets - serves 2; truth be told, I wasnt really into ordering these, as Ive had lamb at restaurants where it had always tasted game-y; these lamb ribs? Absolutely delicious! It had the right amount of fat, super tender, super moist, super flavorful, and it fell right off the bone - I loved the crisp exterior as well as being paired with the creamy onion salad - yum!). For drinks, I tried the Just Like Abuelita Used to Make, which is tepache (a fermented pineapple soft drink; its interesting and not too sweet, but paired well with all of the dishes), a celery root tonic with vinegar (soothed those who are a little congested), as well as a delicious cup of their hibiscus with blood orange (this was tart, refreshing, and I could have drank this all day!). I loved how their beverages (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) were unique, fun, and creative, and went went with each of the dishes! For dessert, we tried the Butterscotch Buddino (with sliced blood orange and a burnt marshmallow on top; this came in a cup, and the consistency was that of a creme brulee/custard; slightly overly sweet, but paired well with the blood orange and the creamy marshmallow), and the Roasted Pineapple Float (made with tepache and coconut sorbet; this was a bit disappointing, as it tasted watered down, not carbonated enough, and the coconut sorbet wasnt dense to make the drink nice and creamy). Our server was Carly B., and she was super awesome - very welcoming, friendly, attentive, and made sure that everything was perfect :D Ms. Jill, one of the co-owners, also walked around and talked with the dining patrons, which was really great to see! The restaurant itself is very cute and intimate, with soft blues, light wood, and hanging dim lights - I would love to come back to try their cocktails as well as their seasonal changes :D A lovely little gem in the Adams Morgan area - check them out! :D+hibiscus blood orange beverage :D+Salt-crusted cod :D+Stracciatella :D+Maltagliati+Crispy Salt Cod+Grilled Rabbit Sausage+Lamb Ribs :D+GF-friendly!+ask for Carly B :D :D :D+friendly staff!+reservations taken online :D+extremely limited parking off of Adams Mill Rd, There is no sincerer love than the love for food. George Bernard ShawThe overall experience from walking in to the restaurant to leaving was remarkably enjoyable and I will return! First off props to the Chef and his crew. And most importantly to the staff on floor who were all so welcoming and splendid. The food was amazing! My friend and I had the cod fish.. Brown rice bread, stracciatella, maltagliati, almond cake? and blood orange buddino. All of them we delightful in taste and texture. I especially loved the blood orange buddino for its rich flavor! Yum! I will be back to try the other items on the menu ineed!, 4.25I wasnt sure what I should have expected, but when I was told Tail Up Goat was the brainchild of former chefs who worked at Komi and Little Serow, I was intrigued. To set the tone of this intimate restaurant, everything was situated and placed distinctively to provide a relaxed and cool environment. Pretentious, but not overwhelmingly so, every item (from tables and chairs to uniforms) seemed reasonably light, yet hypsterish. Tail Up Goat is reminiscent of a flipped old lighthouse, fashionably stated, of course. This is a restaurant to grab a drink with friends, to make reservations for on a date night, or a place to invite your parents while visiting. The menu is rather small, but like many similar restaurants of the same caliber, the chefs have opted to focus on quality and not quantity. This factoid reined true when dish after dish, small and large plates, managed to make me feel warm and fuzzy inside, with a realization that this is fancy comfort food, made with fresh, yet basic ingredients...into interesting and hip new dishes. Because I have to acknowledge my unfortunate sensitivity to gluten, I will only focus on the gluten free items:Braised Carrots - cooked perfectly. Comes with a mix of orange and white carrots. Not too sweet, and not too woodsy. Perfect. Charred Rabbit Sausage- really good. A little sweet and a little savory, a whole lot of flavor. I was not disappointed. Charred Chocolate Rye- I couldnt participate in eating the bread, but I tried the pickles, Trickling Springs butter and sardines and they were amazing. I loved the bite of the pickles and the creamy richness of the butter. The sardine, encrusted and encased in salt (we had to remove the sardine from the tower of salt), was perfectly seasoned with crispy skin. Stracciatella- similar to burrata in texture, this creamy mozzarella came with thinly sliced radish and apples and a drizzle of lemon olive oil. I wasnt as impressed with this dish. Although meant to be light and fresh, I expected a more flavorful dish. Smoked Hen of the Woods Mushroom- modified from burnt bread sauce to a burnt yogurt sauce, I would be lying if I said I didnt enjoy eating this beautiful hearty dish initially, but somewhere in between my first and last bite, I despised the smokey taste of the mushroom and wish for a more flavored sauce. The overall, non-modified dish is great for vegetarians, but I wasnt impressed. It was more interesting than anything with the salty chicken skin. Lamb Ribs- amazing. Hannah H. Wasnt interested in this item, but when it came out her eyes got big. I, on the other hand, knew this would be a great dish. And boy was I right! Tender, fall off the bone meat, with just enough fat to maintain the juiciness, and placed on top of a creamy onion salad and beets. These ribs tasted like they were marinated a couple of days before...the Mediterranean flavors ran through and through. I was very impressed. We were offered a commentary small glass of celery tonic. This included apple cider vinegar and cane sugar. Want to put a bandaid on a cold? Heres what you drink. If you know anything about celery leaves, you know they have an intensified celery taste, which translated into this drink. Couple that with the acid of the apple cider vinegar, and...lets just say Im glad it was watered down with ice. I also had the Limon e Sale. This drink was reminiscent of the Lucas l3dmon salt I used as a topping on spicy pickles when I was a child. I really enjoyed the uniqueness of the drink. We were also comped a hibiscus-blood orange drink. Very tasty and refreshingly sweet. For desserts E ordered the butterscotch pudding, which was interestingly rich and creamy. Im not sure if I would order this again. We also tried the pineapple float. This was watered down by the coconut sorbet. I think it would have had a better outcome with a full bodied ice cream. Overall, Ill say Tail Up Goat is off to a fantastic start. The service was awesome and the food was probably the best Ive had this year. I will definitely be back to see what new items the chefs add in the coming months.Notes:-Order the ribs!-Order the braised carrots -Order the Rabbit Sausage -Find interesting drinks on the menu-Plenty of options for GF and Vegans/Vegetarians just ask-Make reservations, Excellent food. The seaweed sourdough toast is divine as are the pastas. Only eaten here once so far , so cant comment in remainder of menu, but we plan to sample it all over next few weeks! Beverage list well edited and service precise and friendly. A great addition to DC dining. The new top restaurant in Adams Morgan, So great to have a new (and delicious) spot in the neighborhood. The ambiance is spot on; it reminds me more of a place you would see in London or San Francisco than D.C. The wines we had -the Finger Lakes Cab Franc and the Greek Vidiano- were both unique and tasty. Our server was spectacular and prepared with excellent suggestions. We especially enjoyed the octopus, rabbit sausage and seaweed sourdough. No desert this time, but we will certainly be back soon. A much needed and much welcome addition to Adams Morgans dining scene., When I heard about this place I knew I had to try it. Plus its in my neighborhood so even better! I have to say it was an all around 5 star experience and I look forward to returning. The restaurant is really cute and reminds me of a lot of Little Serow. The staff have that same hipster dress too. The space is small, but very cute and the bar looked nice. The menu is small, but Im a fan of focusing on what you do and doing it well. The rabbit sausage was excellent - perfect blend of savory and sweet. The braised carrots also excellent. I loved the quail though I will say it was not easy to eat. High five to the cook that walked by and whispered to me its totally okay to eat with your hands. Quail requires that. We also ordered the butterscotch pudding and almond cake. I thought both were great. The buttescotch is very rich, but its not too much. The almond cake was great - something sweet, but not too sweet. We also got a complimentary glass of celery drink when we sat down. Its very vinegeary. I liked it, my dining companion did not. Its rather specific so I think hit or miss. Fantastic experience and super happy that this place is in the neighborhood. For sure Ill be back!!!, I was impressed by the food and the service. But some things just left me with a puzzled look on my face. The menu- while the food is great, the menu is confusing and thematically grouped. While you can guess what is an appetizer or an entree by the price, it takes the wait staff to explain and help you choose. Id rather spend the time with my dinner guests, than deciphering what is being served. The wine list is worse. Drinks seems to be grouped according to clever phrases, things that the staff likes or a thematic heading. Island Time is not a cocktail, but a heading for a Caribbean made beer. Rivers and Valleys is a heading for wines and other drinks that are made in regions with Rivers and valleys. A fun word game, but if I want a glass of red with my delicious lamb- it doesnt work., We went here on Sunday night without a reservation, but didnt have any trouble getting a table since they reserve 1/2 the restaurant for walk in/neighborhood business. The space is really inviting. The host and our waitress were all very nice and attentive. We ordered the rabbit sausage with fennel and radicchio, the rutabaga ravioli, the lamb ribs and the almond cake. All of the food was wonderful. The rabbit sausage and ravioli were both delicious, but the lamb ribs with a sumac onion and beet salad stole the show. The ribs dish serves two generously. The ribs fell off the bone and the onion and beet salad was a perfect accompaniment.The almond cake for dessert was not to sweet and had a good texture with the moist cake, mascarpone, peach preserves and slivered almonds. The one piece of criticism I have are their wines by the glass. The night we went there were only 4 reds by the glass without much of a price range. While one was 8 dollars, two others shot up to 14, which would give me pause anywhere. All in all, it didnt feel like we were visiting a restaurant that had just opened, there were no service or food kinks and the food really stole the show. Looking forward to returning to Tail Up Goat. It is a great addition to the neighborhood!, Just what Adam Morgan needs! At only one week old, Im already a huge fan of Tail Up Goat! The service is as good as it gets--thanks Pammy!--, the decor is beautiful and warm... AND THE FOOD! Wow, simply delicious. If you like Komi and Little Serow, your going to love the attention to detail here, and thats no surprise given the ownership. This is a must visit and is surely going to make it on every DC restaurant list over the next year. Make a reservation while you can still get in.Heres what we got:Starters:Crispy salt cod ($9) AGrilled rabbit sausage ($10) A+ Bread:Seaweed sourdough ($10) A+1st Course:Praised carrots ($13) A+Grilled quail and greek yogurt ($17) B2nd Course:Cavatelli ($18) ASmoked rutabaga ravioli ($15) AMain Course:Lamb ribs ($42) A++Grilled pork ($27) BDesert:Almond cake ($9) B, A lovely addition to the fine dining scene in Adams Morgan. The decor is spare but lovely and calming. I loved the blue walls and wooden ceiling. The service was top notch but I agree with the others that we had a hard time deciphering the food menu and wine list so it was especially helpful to have the staff on hand. This place really shines with their breads and pastas - every dish has some sort of bread topping or crumble. Pro Tip: order the colonizers cocktail, it was a highlight., My boyfriend and I came here during opening week and had a fantastic dinner. Service was excellent and remained gracious in the face of my ever-changing reservation time.We had the grilled rabbit sausage skewers, maltagliati (pasta with sausage and pea shoots), and an order of the lamb ribs (described as fit for two on the menu).Each dish was perfect! The sausage was a perfect combination of crispy, salty sausage and rich, buttery grilled greens--it does come with only two small skewers for $10, but I dont think most people come to Tail Up Goat thinking its going to be a cheap meal.The maltagliati was really good--we were torn between all three pasta options and Jill, our waitress/co-owner, recommended the maltagliati based on our other choices. The honey sausage was slightly sweet, very savory and the garlicky, green bite from the pea shoots was the perfect balance. The pasta itself was definitely made from fresh pasta and really delicious.The lamb ribs--this is the one thing that just blew Tail Up Goat out of the water for me--these were SO GOOD. Tender, falling-off-the-bone meant yet also super crispy on the outside. Incredibly flavorful and definitely a generous portion for two. We basically licked the plate clean. Of the main entrees currently offered on the menu (all of which are basically my favorite foods ever), I would get this again and again without question.As other have metioned, Tail Up Goat fills a void thats been missing in Adams Morgan and I am super excited to visit again in the future! Its a medium sized space, but the tables do run a bit close for comfort, so if that bothers you, be warned! They have really nice booth against the walls that are way more comfortable than their table tops, so Id try to mention that in your reservation if you can., A perfect date spot. Every dish was delicious and very well balanced, and my boyfriend and I got to nerd out about orange wines, of which they have a great selection. The service was excellent and very gracious. The pictures say everything you need to know. One note -- the lamb ribs have hazelnuts on top. If youre allergic to nuts, choose something else. The porgy was a good alternative., When my friend recommended Tail Up Goat for dinner on Thursday night I wasnt sure what to expect. All I knew was I was too lazy to look up new restaurants to try and this was definitely new. At only three weeks old this place has already made its mark.The goodCrispy salt cod - these were little croquettes of cod on a bed of pur39ed cauliflower and pickled onions. I think there may have been some tahini in the cauliflower, it reminded me of hummus. I was a little obsessed with the pickled onionsCharred chocolate with sea salt crusted sardines - my friends and I were a little hesitant to order this one as only one of my friends has had sardines before. However when we spoke to our server he confirmed that the sardines come separately from the bread. So if we hated them wed still have the yummy bread. Anywho so glad we got this loved the sardines with the bread and persimmons.Straciatella (sp?) - I never knew what the cream inside burrata is called until I came here. If you love burrata youll love this. It tastes pretty fresh.Braised carrots - yum thats allLamb ribs - OMG you have to get these! It is AH-MA-ZING the meat just falls off the bones. There were 3 of us and this was the perfect portion for our appetites.Service - our server was attentive and knowledgable The MehButterscotch budino - a little too sweet for my tastes but my friends loved itThe badI cant really think of anything. Im pretty sure this will become a restaurant you need to book well in advance., Tail Up Goat is one of my new favorite DC restaurants. I love how creative and tasty the dishes were. We went to on Friday evening at 6:30 and didnt have a problem getting a table. Dishes I Loved:--Magliatelli Pasta. Omg amazing. Pasta was fresh, greens were delicious, sauce was sweet. Loved it.---Straciatella with Watermelon Radishes - The cheese was delicious and the watermelon radish and homemade bread crisps worked deliciously with it. Dishes I didnt like:---Rutabaga Pasta dish. It was a bit bitter and the gingerbread was a little weird with it. Innovative idea though.All in all thought it was a great meal- up there with the best of meals Ive had in DC. I liked the atmosphere as well- it was a beautiful and quiet restaurant which I appreciated. Service was great, memorably so-- the server was friendly and fun and sweet., Came here the other night and I liked the food, and the service was nice. They had an interesting selection of drinks, ranging from eclectic wines and Basque cider, to cocktails.For food I had the:- grilled rabbit sausage, fennel mostarda, marinated radicchio- liver mousse, huckleberry jam, bread chips- cavatelli, octopus ragu, green olive, breadcrumbs- braised carrots, sticky garlic, honeycombThe food was good, overall, but the portions were much too small for the price. I could only understand the price point if the food was so incredibly complex and interesting that it was worth the differential. E.g. the braised carrots had maybe a whole carrot, sliced up. One carrot. If that. $13? Really? It wasnt the most mind-blowing carrot ever. It was a carrot. Braised, glazed and cooked in honey and other seasoning. The rabbit sausage itself was only ok, and again very small portions. Octopus ragu was not particularly amazing...it didnt have a nicely charred flavor or anything. It wasnt bad, just pretty good. I could make the liver mousse at home...theyre likely just buying the mousse, packing it into a jar, and tossing some jam on it. There was nothing particularly amazing about it.I would give this place 3 stars, but Im bumping to 4 temporarily because theyre new, in my neighborhood, had a nice staff, and an interesting bar selection., Very solid. Unique food that definitely delivered. Had the seaweed sourdough which was very tasty. Pasta with an octopus ragu was really different yet also delicious. Lamb ribs were exceptionally tender and rich. A bit fatty but overall a very good dish. I was impressed, not totally blown away. But its absolutely one of the better restaurants in the Adams Morgan area., I went here with two friends on a Saturday night. We really enjoyed the food and the ambiance, the staff were attentive, and it was overall a great dining experience.Reservation: Since I live close by, I dropped by at 6 pm to put out names down, and we got a call back by 7:30pm so the wait time isnt that bad yet. Food: most of the plates are meant to be shared, so we ordered six dishes in total. The highlight were brown rice bread and the smoked rutabaga ravioli.Seaweed sourdough: the cicciloli was a bit heavy for my liking (pate is not my thing), the overall taste was good. Brown rice bread: everything about this was perfect; the bread, the turnip, the cheese! I enjoyed how all the different textures came together.Stracciatella: it was a cross between burrata and fresh cottage cheese, which was interesting. I liked that it came with radish and apple slices.Smoked rutabaga ravioli: the BEST dish of the night both in terms of flavor and freshness of the pasta. The smokiness of rutabaga inside the ravioli was amazing. The pesto sauce was also not overpowering and perfect!Lamb ribs: the dish is meant for two people, but l think the portion would be generous enough for 3 to share. I enjoyed the flavor of this dish (its definitely a Mediterranean twist with beets, mint, and raw red onions) but I wish the lamb had more meat to them.The staff were attentive and nice, so it was really pleasant! Im not giving all 5 stars because the dessert menu was subpar, and when I asked, theyre not expecting to change their menu seasonally. But Ill go back again!, What a great dining experience. Truly outstanding service--from our hostess who helped get us a walk in table for two, to our awesome waitress, Victoria, the entire staff is welcoming, knowledgable and fun--its like having your super fun foodie friend having you over for dinner. The food and drink were superb. Seaweed toast, lamb chops and honey sausage pasta are not to be missed and the sparkling orange wine was fantastic. This is one of our new favorites. Keep up the good work!, Let me start by saying, without pretension, that I am a foodie and have eaten at every really good restaurant in DC. I rarely review. Having said that, let me say that Tail Up Goat is absolutely one of the best. Im actually loath to recommend them because I dont want tables to become impossible, which I suspect they will in a month or so. Chef Jon Sybert and his wife Jill Tyler have caught lightning in a bottle. The food is fabulous. We started with the rabbit sausage, perfect and nicely seasoned, then moved on to the chocolate rye w salt packed sardines and butter, followed by an octopus cavatelli that was literally plate licking good, and finished off with lamb ribs which frankly redefined lamb for me. All of this was accompanied by an exceptional red, the Aetneus Etna Rosso, personally recommended by Jill after discussing our tastes and entree inclinations. Our bartender, Alex, was helpful and knowledgable. I spoke briefly w Chef and his passion was obvious. Run, do not walk, to this amazingly good restaurant., Amazing, amazing food - it is like a burst of flavors in your mouth ... perfect portions & such wonderful service to complete the night. My water glass was never unfilled & the wine pairings were perfect with what we ate ... brown rice bread, rabbit sausage, carrot ravioli .. delicious! Such a treat for my palette., I was shockingly impressed. Even after reading all the wonderful reviews, I was like really how good can it be? In fact some of the menu items look a little strange, while others look intriguing. Just kidding! I was super blown away.Stopped by here on a sleepy Friday night at around 9:30pm, and it was still completely packed. I loved the cozy ambiance. My friend and I started with the crispy salt cod and the spring radish and were instantly thrilled. The salt cod was really delicious, the outside perfectly crisp and the inside moist and flavorful. The picked red onions gave it a nice balance since it was a little salty. The radishes were quite possibly my favorite item. They are very simple and light but I loved the herb yogurt and when my friend offered me the remainder, I quickly scarfed them down. We then shared the asparagus which we both loved. Its much heartier and much more filling than I anticipated. The sauce was great, and they were a really excellent dish. I then had the cavatelli and she had the gluten free maltagliati, which had completely different flavor profiles but were both great. The octopus in my dish was perfectly cooked, and there was a lot of it. The green olives were a nice addition, and the anchovy wasnt overwhelming but added a nice salty taste to a tomato-y style sauce. The maltagliati was totally unexpected in flavor. The whole dish was sweeter and had a creamier style, but was still very light.We then shared the butterscotch budino which did us both in over our fullness levels. It was much richer than we anticipated, and the strawberry jam was a nice addition. It was really a combination I can honestly say I havent quite tasted before, with the buttery texture, and the salty pistachios and concentrated sweet jam. It was nice to try, but probably wouldnt get again. Overall a really pleasant experience. Service was also PHENOMENAL, which I didnt mention before. I think our server really made our experience. She was incredibly enthusiastic, and friendly but not overly friendly. She was happy to recommend items on the menu and was able to provide a lot of insight based on what we wanted. She really solidified it as 5 stars for me.I would really recommend for fine dining in the Adams Morgan area. It was a really nice surprise., The meal was just delicious, with a perfect combination of light offerings (radishes were divine) with the heavy (pasta) and meats (lamb ribs - cant miss - with a tasty salad underneath). The service was superior - friendly, approachable, but detailed. We noted in our reservation that it was our anniversary, and we were given a class of champagne and a nice scoop of sorbet in acknowledgment of the special occasion. The wine reommendations were unique and perfect compliment to the dinner. It is pricey - but was worth it for the quality of the meal., Great atmosphere, surprisingly delicious food, and real service. The restaurant provided the vegetarian in our group with a special menu indicating the possible vegetarian choices - nice touch. Our server knew the menu inside and out and was a true professional. The owner checked in very graciously to make sure we were completely satisfied with all of our dishes. It was a truly great dining experience., I was very impressed with our dinner on a Sunday evening. Service was generally very good (though near the end of our meal I realized that there two or three empty cocktail glasses still sitting on the table). But nothing major, which is great, considering how new this restaurant is.Food was great, though I caution that you really cannot order enough of it. The menu is progressive, in the sense that the dishes move from small bites to large, family style portions. I really wanted to try the hen of the woods mushroom, but we ended up passing on the last category of family-style entrees. The pastas were great, and the potato salad was also an interesting dish. Carrot ravioli was very delicate but good. I could have eaten a couple plates on my own.To those who cant get a table at Roses Luxury (or more to the point, dont want to wait in line -- and you shouldnt wait in line), Id recommend Tail Up Goat. It was a really great meal, where everything we had was good. If it wasnt already clear from the other reviews, or the fact that this is a new, great restaurant in Adams Morgan, Tail Up Goat is not exactly a cheap place to eat. Its worth it though., First off, let me say that the service was impeccable! They were very attentive and our server was super cheery and amazingly helpful with picking out our dishes. It was my friend birthday and Pammy made sure to make her feel very special. If it were not for the service, I would have given this review 1.5-2 stars.The menu is very different and quite interesting. Very modern, new American. We definitely needed some explanation to certain items before we ordered. Every dish that came out looked SOOO promising. They were all so visually beautiful. But after our first bite of each dish, we seemed to be disappointed every time. Everything was salty and lacked that extra oomph of flavor. Its like they tried to mask the missing flavor with extra sodium. It seemed like something was always missing. Also the dishes were all very small, but it was understandable since it seemed more like a shared dish experience. But out of 4 people, we were only able to have one bite each of a starter or small plate.Heres what we ordered:Starter:Liver Mousse: ($11) I would have loved this if they replaced the pickled beets on the top with some type of sweeter fruity preserve to contrast the heavy creamy taste of the liver mousse. Instead the pickled beets did not mend well with the liver.Bread:Seaweed Sourdough: ($11) The bread was SOOO good! There was seaweed literally baked into the bread! So soft and chewy...YUMM!! But the topping on top of the bread was way too salty. Some of us just scraped off the topping and ate just the bread itself.Small Plate: Potato Salad: ($14) This dish was very interesting. It was like a deconstructed potato salad. Might be one of my favorite dishes. But still more on the salty side, probably because of the trout roe. Maltagliati: ($17) Again really promising!...but salty. And the dish was quite small. Main Course:Lamb Ribs: ($44) Everyone on Yelp raved about this so we knew that we had to order this. The lamb was fall off the bone! Very tender, but SALTY and lacked that flavor!!..and so was the sauce nestled on the bottom of the dish (Which I didn know existed till we were almost done with the dish!)Whole Stuffed Porgy: ($25) This was GOOD! The stuffed kale inside the fish was really delcious! The only thing I did not like about this dish was the black walnut vinaigrette that was dressed on the plate. It was very funky, stinky and fermented tasting and we didn even know what it was and had to ask our server. It definitely did not taste like walnuts. GROSS!We had pretty high hopes for this place, and I think that I would give this place another try. Hopefully when I get the chance to come back again, they will have improved on understanding the difference between flavor and salt., We were thrilled to get a reservation for a Friday night, but left disappointed. First, let me say the wait staff were extraordinarily helpful and patient with our indecision. We finally settled on the sour dough bread, chocolate bread, and mousse with crisps, clearly not watching our carbs! They were all great, but we were totally grossed by the lard served with the bread basket. We didnt catch the cache of the spread. We also shared the porgy and were sorely disappointed. Before ordering we asked if it was deboned and were assured only a few light bones would remain. That was partially true. The porgy was mediocre at best but the side sun chokes were over the top. Would I return? No. Would I recommend it? Maybe for the breads., I really appreciate that they cater to food allergies and even marked up the menu for items that I was allergic to and made appropriate substitutions.crispy salt cod, smoked cauliflower, pickled red onion 9The cod was not overly breaded and the cod had a really nice texture to it. Since I have an allergy to red onions, they substituted it for pickled celery which perfectly complemented the saltiness of the cod and smokiness of the cauliflower puree.brown rice bread, roasted carrot, blood orange, hazelnut picada 10So this was my favorite dish which was had cold perfectly cooked veggies on top of a toasty hot piece of bread. The dish was hearty and the hazelnut spread added a level of earthiness.lamb ribs, sumac onions, favas, hazelnut dukkah - for two 44Ie never had lamb ribs but the lamb fell right off the bone, a little fatty for my taste so I picked through it to get to the meat but flavor was delicious without being too gamey. The sumac onions were a little overpowering for me but made sense for the dish. There were mushrooms and fava beans that felt a little out of place and didn add anything to the dish.burnt strawberry jam, mascarpone, amaro syrup, toast 9Our waitress described this as the adult jam sandwich and it had a great balance of not being overly sweet. I didn really taste burnt strawberry jam but just strawberry jam but really enjoyed the dessert overall. I love that the restaurant makes their own bread and it really shines in all the bread dishes.Service was consistent throughout the meal, the servers seems to share in making sure all the tables are well taken care of including a food runner. Our server gave us a recommendation on The Ultimate Island Wine, Madeira, Rainwater, Broadbent, Madeira, Portugal, NV 9 which we enjoyed immensely. It was a nice sherry to sip throughout the meal that complemented each of our dishes.Total meal was $99 for 2 people without tip and I would definitely come back to try their pasta dishes since those are made in house also., I went here for Mothers Day and was seated right away for my 5:30pm reservation. Before I came, I was a big fan of the chef because I dined at his restaurant in Chicago. I forgot the name of the restaurant, but it had goat in it...Anyways, this restaurant is not as good as the one in Chicago. The menu didnt even have goat options. I was a bit disappointed. The seaweed bread was good, but there one topping that overpowered the dish and made me put it down and not eat it anymore. I ordered other dishes, but wasnt impressed. However, the dish for two (Lamb Ribs) was great! Also they serve complimentary juice in the beginning to freshen up your palate!, This is a very stylish restaurant. Its the perfect place to go on a date, because it shows you have refined taste, the service is fantastic, and its trendy. The menu is full of unusual combinations of tastes - really innovative and fun. We ordered multiple things from the menu (you have to; this is tapas style), and everything was interesting. But I cant really say that anything was truly delicious. For my taste, there was too much salt in all or nearly all dishes. And the unusual combinations of ingredients, though interesting, did not make me eager for more. I left without an urge to come back to have any of the dishes ever again. For me, thats an unusual experience when going to a good restaurant. This restaurant is trying hard and its novel and so for that reason alone I suggest you try it. I wish this place success and hope that menu adjustments might do the trick. Maybe Im just too conventional in my tastes. Or maybe if you come with modest expectations, youll like it more., I really dont understand all of the accolades this place is getting. My dinner mate and I left disappointed and wishing we had dined somewhere else.Lets start with their wines. As it was near 90 degrees out, I opted for a glass of rose. They had 3 on the list (not bad), the first one was $9/glass, next was $18/glass and the final one $34/glass -- for a rose??? I got the $9 one and was unimpressed. My dinner mate order 2 different whites and liked neither.As for food, while I adore complicated dishes with unexpected flavor combos (Im looking at you Roses Luxury!), this menu felt a bit too precious. We opted for the liver mousse which lacked flavor (?!?) and was served with what I can only described as burnt, hard slivers of bread. Next up we had a pasta with sausage - this dish was fine and the highlight of the evening.And for our main, we ordered the mushroom dish. Worst dish ever. The burnt sauce was too overpowering and distracted from the mushrooms. The mushrooms were too salty and the crispy chicken skins which should have been delish, just tasted like fat. We sent the dish back. The waiter handled our feedback graciously. I have a feeling this is not the first time this dish as gone back.I feel for Adams Morgan with all of its bars and restaurants, but no real gems (sad Cashions has closed). Tail Up Goat could have been a contender, but alas., This was our second time visiting, a spontaneous date night before my wifes weeklong business trip abroad. I called at 6:30pm about walk-in availability. We walked over in 5 minutes and were promptly seated on a Thursday evening. We were treated to a complimentary pallet opening drink. My wife ordered the Rosee and I grabbed a Mexican cola. We started with the salted cod (5 balls of deliciousness) and the spring radishes which were equally as good as the cod (7 pieces). We also opted for the seaweed sourdough, which has pork and fennel on top. The portion was good, but it takes a minute to figure out how to approach it since its larger than bite size and difficult to cut.She opted for the orange wine for the next order, which she loved. We went with the straciatella (crispy artichoke with a yogurt) and the maltagliati (sweet and savory pasta with sausage and shoots). Both were again surprisingly (maybe not surprising) scrumptious. Portions were on point as well.Meal totaled $94 before tip (5 dishes, 2 alcoholic bev, 1 NA bev).Only thing I wouldve wanted was an opentable reservation option. Check it out. So great to have a great neighborhood option., I was looking at this new restaurant for sometime but did not get a chance to go until today. Hostesses were very welcoming, nice atmosphere, walls painted in my favorite light blue color....relaxing and smelled sooo good! I did not have much time and got a seat at the bar where older gentleman bartender was very attentive & friendly, you would think he is the owner or a manager because he was taking care of the place & his guests like it was his own!!! Rabbit sausage on the stick with grilled onions & slightly sweet fruit was fantastic! Asparagus portion was huge and delicious. Seaweed sourdough sandwich was too salty for me but I wish I had a beer to fix that problem, unfortunately I had to return to work. Overall was fantastic experience and I cant wait to go back to try everything else on their menu., This place was amazing! Amazing food and amazing service. I was visiting DC for the weekend from Seattle and my family wanted somewhere nice to celebrate my birthday. Founding Fathers didnt have any reservations open so we figured wed try this place. Im so glad we did! Service:The waiters and waitresses were all extremely courteous, warm, and welcoming. Having worked in the food industry for almost seven years, I know what Im talking about. At least four or five of them wished me happy birthday and they brought out a serving of delicious coconut ice cream sorbet. Also, for every course of the meal, they provided new plates and even new silverware! Slightly wasteful practice but as one who doesnt really enjoy mixing my foods, I was happy with this. Food:My family ordered the brown rice bread and the cavatelli pasta as an appetizer. For our main course, we got lamb ribs and whole stuffed porgy. Both were delicious. As a Japanese family from the Pacific Northwest, were always weary about ordering fish but we were not disappointed at all. My mother, who is usually more of a fan of lamb over fish in restaurants, loved the fish. The kale stuffing win the vinaigrette dressing had just enough flavor not to overwhelm the fish when consumed together. The lamb was very tender and seasoned well. My brother-in-law was a fan of all the greens that accompanied the lamb as kind of a garnish. Over all, if I lived here, I would definitely make this a regular spot. Unfortunately, Ill have to wait until Im in DC again. Ill definitely recommend this place to anyone heading over to this area., Came with a group of four, no reservations, and wound up having great drinks and appetizers at the bar before venturing elsewhere for dinner. The bar service couldn have been more helpful and warm. We all found interesting wines we loved and enjoyed trying four decadent dishes. The seaweed sourdough was the universal favorite--rich and full of savory flavor--and the potato salad was a close runner up (creamy comfort food plus trout roe). The rabbit sausage had four skewers so was a fun mouthful to try (sweet and salty). The liver mousse was also great--I typically can stand liver, but the usual flavor was cut by the tomato jam on top. A couple of us coulde made a meal of the accompanying bread crisps, which basically tasted like the best crouton ever. Everything is quite rich, so it easy to feel sated even by smaller portions. A little pricey but a nice treat., Typical pretentious DC restaurant that doesnt quite live up to the hype or the price point. I give it four stars because the food is actually good, but not good enough to justify the price point. Four dishes and a bottle of wine set two people back $200. Again, it was good, but not that good and Ive had better meals for less money. My one critical complaint about the food was the lamb dish. Lamb is all good and well, but they serve a dish thats enough for 5 people. One or two lamb chops are good, but 20 of them just gave me a stomach ache. Lamb is too heavy to serve in such large quantities. So, maybe just make it a smaller (and less expensive) serving., I loved this place! Every dish we ordered was amazing. I didnt feel that anything was too salty as stated in other reviews. It was one of the best meals that I have had in awhile and Ive been to a number of places with rave reviews lately that were just ok (e.g. Fiola Mare, Roses). We tried the following:1. liver mousse - pretty good2. maltagliatti - a must order as the pasta was perfectly cooked with delicious fresh veggies3. lamb ribs - amazing! It is a large dish, but you can take leftovers home. I see no issues with the size. 4. strawberry jam toast - I didnt want dessert, but the table next to us highly recommended it so we ordered it. It is delicious! Most desserts tend to be too sweet for me, but this is perfect. Lightly sweetened with the fruit being the star. I am already plotting to come back., Very simply put - some of the best food Ive eaten in a long time! From start to finish our meal was creative, surprising, impeccably presented and delicious. The staff greeted us with warmth and smiles (even though we were delayed and arrived just at their closing time), and let us enjoy our experience without any rush or pressure to get out. Wines and cocktails were interesting, and always love a waiter that knows wine and makes terrific recommends based on the food ordered. Every dish that hit the table sang! The Spring Radish - crunchy and fresh and so tasty with its well seasoned yogurt and crunchy, salty gingerbread crumble (we may have licked the plate); The Rabbit Sausage - perfectly cooked and so flavorful; the Asparagus - charred, crisp, somewhat decadent feeling because of the shaved yolk. My favorite to hit the table the whole night came at the suggestion of our waiter - Brown Rice Bread with Roasted Carrot - havent ever eaten anything like it! Texturally the bread was crispy on the edges and soft, and cloud-like in the center, soaking up the yogurt like spread, and creating such a unique bed for the sweet, simply roasted heirloom carrots. Wanted another!By the time the grilled pork and lamb ribs hit the table, there were big smiles and happy bellies and neither entree disappointed. The flavorful lamb, piled high, fell away from the bone with barely a touch. The pork, so tender, surrounded by the most perfectly cooked, nutty farro.Would return, no WILL return, here again!, Had the brown rice bread, asparagus, maltagliati and whole stuffed porgy... absolutely delicious! Have also had their amazing lamb ribs. This restaurant is a neighborhood and District gem., I came here with a group of 4 on a Sunday night (and I made the reservation a month in advance!). We ended up staying for 3 hours and not once did I feel rushed to leave! The meal starts with a complimentary seasonal tonic (ours was a green tomato juice with coriander infused apple cider vinegar... yes infused vinegar!). It was delicious and a nice way to start the meal.Its rose season and Tail Up Goat does not disappoint! They had an extensive menu and our server was incredibly knowledgable. He described one as funky with bits of the peel actually in the wine and a very vinegary taste. We didnt end up ordering but he brought it out and let us try it anyways!For the food we got: Spring Radish, Brown Rice Bread with Roasted Carrots, Stracciatella, Carrot Ravioli and of course the Lamb Ribs! The radishes and bread came out together first, giving us a first glimpse of what was to be the best meal Ive had all year! The bread was a standout, holding up the most delicious roasted carrots with an orange glaze. I also really liked the stracciatella, a type of stretched mozzarella, that came with red and green strawberries. The salty/sweet combo was delicious. And of course the lamb ribs.. for someone who doesnt eat a lot of red meat I was scraping the bones clean! I really like the way Tail Up Goat layers all of their dishes - for instance the lamb was served with sumac onions in a yogurt sauce, fresh mint and dill, mustard seed and the spices on the lamb as well. Getting all of that in one bite is the best way to enjoy the dish!For dessert we got the cannolis and the burnt strawberry toast. Always go for the toast at Tail Up Goat - you will not be disappointed. I had an amazing meal and cant wait to go back at a later time to see how they change with the seasons - I can imagine some amazing dishes with fall produce., Long story short: It was okay, and thats it.I had sort of high expectations because I am over the moon in love with Little Serow and Komi, but I dont think it would have taken much to impress me either because I was so excited to try everything. The reason Im giving 3 stars is because the service was incredible as many other reviews have stated.I feel like prior Yelp reviews led me astray with the porgy, the rabbit sausage and the potato salad. The stuffed whole porgy was not good. At all. I feel like ours wasnt even cooked all the way. I love seafood and thought there was no way I wouldnt love that dish. It just kind of sucked. The potato salad and the rabbit sausage werent bad but they definitely werent great either.The drink menu was way too confusing. Bad beer selection. No specialty gin cocktails at all.We did love the seaweed sourdough!!Probably wont be back. Stinks., Only got wine and desert, which came with a shot of Cruzan, so I cant say anything bad. The woman next to me got the lamb, looked and smelled great. Nice ambience, a burn off the beaten path in Adams Morgan. Worth checking it out., I came here in a group of four without reservations on a Friday night (early), with no idea what to expect. I can say I was truly blown away by how delicious the food was, as well as the chill but attentive atmosphere of the servers. We were seated immediately, although the rush started soon after. There was something for everyone on the menu (half of the party were vegetarians), and the server was happy to answer any and all questions. The food was delicious, as were the desserts. Im looking forward to coming back here!, You guys, best food Ive had in a long time. Our server was incredible and just as excited as we were to be there. All of the food was extremely delicious and well thought out. Have to give yall the full lowdown ...1. Crispy salt cod with smoked cauliflower pur39e & picked red onion - amazing smokey flavor on cauli and fried cod balls were just enough2. Brown rice bread with roasted carrot, blood orange & hazelnut picada - highly recommend!! Didnt even taste like carrot and the bread rocked3. Asparagus with almond skordalia, cured egg yolk & pecorino - egg yolk was salty and delic and asparagus was cooked perfectly4. Carrot ravioli with baby leeks, pistachio breadcrumbs & apricots - THE WINNER, so delicious and not too rich definitely will be coming back next time Im in DC!, This place is wonderful - good ambiance and very inventive and delicious food. Great service throughout the evening from all staff. The noise level may be a little high for some, but with a group of friends who are comfortable speaking up it was the scene for a fantastic evening!I sampled a number of dishes - most of the servings do seem to be small plates. All were delicious (hummus toast, bolognese, crispy cod, and cannoli), but my favorites were the stracciatella (salty cheese and strawberry) and the burnt strawberry jam with house made bread. Yum! Though I didnt partake, there was also an expansive drinks menu that got rave reviews from my friends., We were disappointed with the minuscule appetizer portions-but really happy with the delicious entrees! The lamb ribs (for two) and whole stuffed porgy (for two) were unique and tasty and flavorful., Our first visit to the hot new spot from the creators of Komi and Little Serow did not disappoint! From the opening shrub shot to the final bite of delicious lamb ribs, everything ranged from good to fabulous. The pickled veggies were a wonderful touch in both the salt cod and the seaweed bread dishes. I call out the veggies just because theye such a treat, and could be overlooked with the wild flavors the kitchen pulls together. The potato salad was a deconstructed treat, and the roe was juicy and delicious. If I could give Tail Up Goat 4.5 stars, I would; it get a 5 except that the dishes were too heavy on the salt for me... not overwhelmingly so, but more than it seemed to require. I know some folks balk at the prices, but to me it seemed reasonable for the quality and creativity. Even the cocktails were a treat... I rather have something tasty and unusual that made with care instead of the usual bar offerings. We plan to return and sample their other creations--the ones we had tonight were excellent!, Really 3.5 Stars. First off, as should always be, service was great here! The hostess was very helpful throughout my entire process. The owner (the lady) was moving throughout the place checking up on patrons and you have to love that! We ordered the salt Cod and rabbit sausage to start. The Cod was amazing, a definite pleaser. The rabbit sausage itself was delicious, but the other items on the skewer were not so good for me. My main dish were the lamb ribs...oh my sweet nipple cheeks those things were good to go!!! Everything about the dish work well. I would definitely return for the ribs alone...the only reason I give it 3.5 and not 4.5 is because Im big on value and I feel the place is a bit overpriced for what they offer, but so if every other place in the district of take fundsia. Overall great new place and definitely will be back!, Ok, first off, after reading about the name, just thought it was the cutest thing. Anyway, on to the food and drink. Well, we only got the complimentary drink and we both didnt like it (saw that quite a few tables also didnt finish it, even though it was a small glass of it). We ordered the gluten free pasta with goat meat sauce and the lamb ribs. Both were really yummy. For dessert, my husband got the float, and because of the wait, they gave him a complimentary rum shot. Though that was really nice of them, my husband really didnt like the float/drink at all. I had the burnt strawberry jam. It was yummy, but too sweet for me with too much strawberry jam, but thats an easy fix. It is a really heavy dessert, and actually felt more like a sweet breakfast item (like a french toast equivalent) rather than a dessert (though they could be interchangeable...). Anyway, I couldnt finish it. Glad we didnt order the rice bread... I think wed both be up for going back when Im back in town, but would probably skip the desserts., Great food, service and ambiance!! Our waitress was friendly and knowledgable. The environment is trendy yet cozy. And our food was flavorful and presented beautifully., Believe the hype, people. Tail Up Goat is really as exceptional as you keep hearing. While the ambiance is top notch and the service is above par, the selection of inventive and fresh food is what will make you want to come back again, and again, and again to enjoy another taste of the (insert any menu item here). I cannot speak to their drink selection as I stuck to beer (Bell Two Hearted in a 16oz can), but my dining companions and I enjoyed a varied selection of the menu on a Saturday at 5pm (a time when people were already lined up at the door). The seaweed sourdough and brown rice bread are truly mouth watering, with the latter likely to inspire a duplicate order moments after devouring. The crispy salt cod and the deconstructed potato salad also hit the spot. As delightful as those offerings are, they don hold a candle to the deservedly heralded lamb ribs. Words cannot describe the tenderness, perfect flavor, and finger-licking deliciousness of this heaven on a plate. So I won even try - just order it. You will not be disappointed. As a resident of Old Town Alexandria, the Adams Morgan location of Tail Up Goat is not exactly convenient for me. With that being said, I would drive 2 hours to try those lamb ribs again. If only just to get them out of my dreams., We ordered the potato salad, brown rice bread, and the lamb. Everything was delicious, but definitely on the saltier side for my taste. Also had a really fantastic sparkling wine! The waitress was super friendly and helpful with making great food and drink selections., Delicious!! We ordered the brown rice bread, beets green, carrot ravioli, roasted eggplant, and all of the desserts. They were all delicious, but my favorite by far was the brown rice bread. So, so, so good. So good. My second favorite was the roasted eggplant. So tasty. The carrot ravioli was great, not surprisingly. The its a float was surprisingly amazing. The flavors were unique to me, and fantastic. Will definitely return!, Lamb ribs. Cod fritters. Great staff. Reasonably priced. I want to eat the whole menu. Nay, I will., Easily one of the best dining experience Ie had. We had the cod fritters, seaweed sourdough, pappardelle, and lamb ribs. I also had the Colonizers and Colonized cocktail. My favorite parts of the meal were the cocktail and the pappardelle. My cocktail was deliciously complex and not sweet. I feel like so many cocktails are too sweet, but this one with tequila, sherry, and dry cura37ao was smokey perfection. I will definitely order it again. The cod fritters were the best Ie had and the pickled onions were a nice balance. My brother loved the seaweed bread, but I feel more mixed about it. Although the pork topping was good, I found the slice way too oily with not enough acid to cut it. I would not order it again. The pappardelle was magic in my mouth. I have never had anything so surprisingly awesome. The raisins balanced so nicely with the ragu and sardo. This is last meal worthy. Finally, we came for the lamb ribs and they did not disappoint. I would have liked a little more salt and I feel that I needed more instruction on how to blend all the sauces and spices together. Ultimately, I thought they were delicious, lived up to the hype, and I want them again. I know I like a place if I want to go back, because I rarely do, but I will definitely be back. Last note, they had high chairs. I didn have my kids with me, but I appreciate a hot restaurant that recognizes that some parents with little want in on the food game, too., Tail Up Goat is nothing short of spectacular. From the attentive and personable service to the unique food combinations, Tail Up Goat hits the mark at every turn. You can taste the passion behind the Chefs menu with every bite. The attention to small detail (fresh flowers, pre-dinner palate cleanser, simple decor, perfect plating and an extremely knowledge staff) makes for a perfect evening. The layout of the menu is great as well, starting with nibbles and moving toward larger plates. The cod fritters, pressed pork, and carrot ravioli were some of our favorite starters. The unique breads topped with indulgent ingredients are wildly inventive and delicious! This place is a perfect place for foodies and those looking for a unique dining experience., This is my new favorite DC restaurant. I love Komi and Little Serow, and this combined the best of those, made it more casual (and affordable), and its a helluva lot easier to get a reservation.Some highlights -they have stracciatella - no, not the Italian gelato (also delish) - this is like burrata if burrata could be better than burrata (yes, its possible). Major win. Ive only had it in Italy and NYC. They also do toasts. There may be nothing better than good bread with either something to dip it in or something great on top (and they do both). Apparently, toasts are the new brussel sprouts. Or something. Whatever - the cool kids say bread with stuff on it is trending.The LAMB RIBS. OMG. Soooooo good. Yes, its for two. But lets say its just you or you with a vegetarian (horrors) who wont share the ribs. Just get it anyway and take home half in a to-go container. Youll have lunch tomorrow. The salt cod fritters were also amazing, and apparently, I love rabbit sausage. Speaking of vegetarians, the mushroom dish was awesome. The only thing I didnt like was the shrub (sort of a vinegary drink that reminds me a bit of kombucha, which just isnt my thing because it tastes like fruit-flavored pickle juice). But my husband loved it and had mine. Also, it was free because its just a nice little gift from the kitchen at the beginning of your meal.Oh yes - dessert. So, the first time we went, we had a blood orange butterscotch dessert. They changed that out for a strawberry butterscotch dessert, which was almost the same, but honestly, I liked it quite a lot more when it was blood orange. But that might have been a seasonal change because it seems they care about things like fresh and local.The service is also impeccable.Ive been three times already, and if you think about how many restaurants have opened since this one has opened, and my desire to hit all of them, that says a lot. I havent had seconds anywhere else., I was extremely impressed with this restaurant - came here for dinner on Saturday and its incredible.Its new so there will likely be a wait! Theres a great bar selection thats on the other side of the main restaurant - theyve got a full bar and wine selection so theres something for everyone.Vibes: Its got a bit of a farm to table feel - I love that you can see the kitchen from where you eat. Decor is a little funky but still classy and intimate in a comfortable way. Food: Incredible. Didnt try the bread which they are known for but had a creamy peas appetizer (a sort of cheese base) which was rich in flavor. Moved onto the carrot ravioli (yes, carrot) and this might have been my favorite. Finished off with the lamb - and the mustard/garlic/onion seasoning was to die for. Theres an incredible variety to the dishes the restaurant offers and its different enough that you cant find such a selection elsewhere. I will say you dont need to order TOO much because the food is so flavorful., I had dinner at the bar last night and everything from the beginning to the end was spot on. Everyone was friendly and the drinks, music, atmosphere and of course the food were terrific. I had the seaweed sourdough and the grilled pork and both were excellent. I am looking forward to coming back with my girlfriend to share the lamb ribs. A very welcome addition to Adams Morgan., This was one of the best meals I have had here in DC! The food is fresh, creative and unpretentious. The portions are very generous so sharing different items is easy and fun! As a group of four we were able to try lots of dishes and not one of them disappointed! The beet greens salad was tasty and full of an interesting mix of bitter and sweet. It was lightly dressed so you could really taste the greens. The stracciatella (it is like a burrata cheese) with the peaches was a perfect starter, especially when spread onto the absolutely amazing fresh baked bread. (they don bring the bread so ask!!). The beet salad is a very large dish of lightly dressed roasted beets with a puree of spiced creme fraiche that paired beautifully. The lamb ribs is a very large portion (it is meant to be served for 2), but we managed to eat all of it anyway. The pork dish was moist and delicious, and the eggplant has a unique smoky flavor and comes in a nice sauce of fresh peas We laughed when the roasted chicken arrived as it was enormous. Truly a half chicken that is beautifully prepared and presented. It arrives atop a large slice of that wonderful bread I mentioned which is slathered with a layer of a flavorful garlic mayo. Small tomato slices and some greens accompany the chicken. We did not save room for dessert, but if they are anything like the main dishes you won be disappointed. The server was friendly and knowledgable about the liquor (they have some fun cocktails as well as beer and wine) and the food. The atmosphere is fun but not too noisy. Nice to be able to actually have a conversation! Overall a five star night!
66|thai-x-ing-washington|Weve been to Thai X-ing several times. Yeah, the food is good. But- its a one man shop- the man is very nice, dont get me wrong. But he answers the phone AND cooks all the food! The last time we ate there (actually, ordered food from there- its take-out only), I called in the order at like 7pm. We live maybe 3 min. from this place, so I wanted to call him again to make sure it was done. I called at 8pm. It WASNT READY YET. I was starving! So I called back at 8:30. IT WASNT READY YET. I cancelled the order. The food is good (although a little too spicy for me, but I still eat it), but I dont know if its worth that kind of waiting. Maybe you should call your order in a day in advance? :) The man needs some help., This is an experience to be had. If you took Thai x-ing and put it anywhere else in the country, it would stand out as a true gem.One table in the little room. We called ahead for a reservation and ordered ahead of time too. When we walked in our shrimp noodle appetizer was on the table fresh and ready for us. We asked for everything spicy, and it hit the spot.The chicken dish we had was fantastic and the salmon was on point. The veggies served with both were fresh, bright and favorful.The tahi iced teas, served in take out coffee cups, was fantastic.Plus, this restaurant hosts an open kitchen, library, and art collection that you are able to experience first hand.If youe ever wandered to far off places in the world, and have marveled at how hospitable people are and everyone will invite you into their homes, and people are so warm and welcoming in country X, and you miss that genuine hospitality, then go to Thai X-ing.Hooray!, Tyler Cowen...foodie extraordinaire and economics blogger says this place is quickly becoming legendary. I have to agree. This is the best Thai in the District, but a bit inconsistent so give it a few chances because when it wows, it takes the breath away. Stick to curries or the less obvious things. The green curry has totally blown me away to the point of a religious experience and has also left me rather ho hum. As well, Ie had the kee mao twice and was totally unimpressed, but Il order it again a few times to see if it gets better....that the kind of place it is., this is the place id get my thai if i lived in the area (its take-out only). super yummy, but only 4 stars because its a wee salty for my tastes., 4.5 starsstunning. delicious. memorable. ridiculous. outrageous. jaw dropping. comforting. fulfilling. amazing. monumental. fresh. mind blowing. mouth watering. enchanting. erotic. yummy. tasty. scrumptious. sensuous. delectable. luscious. fulfilling. spicy, steamy. enthralling. mesmerizing. wholesome. aromatic. satisfying. entrancing. pleasing. gratifying. homey. enjoyable. riveting. mama mia, captivating. fascinating. flavorful. spectacular. striking. fabulous. lustful. splendid. superb. titillating, oooh-la,-la,magnificent. gorgeous. exquisite. impressive. honest. seductive. soothing. calming.I could go on. This place is not perfect -- as others have noted. I can attest that I once had their Yum Woon Sen -- it was amazing with beautiful fresh shrimp -- on the next trip I was surprised to return home to find shrimpless Yum Woon Sen. It is said to be inconsistent and it can be a little heavy handed in seasoning -- but more often than not it is stunning. This is the little restaurant can put out some magnificent thai food. Thai food to me might be one of the best smells in the world when it comes to food -- and this smells better than any Thai food I have ever experienced. The food is honest, homey and comforting -- not to mention delicious. It is as Chloe says, an experience.You need to call ahead. There is a lobster in green curry, but that needs to be ordered a day in advance. This place could be easily overwhelmed -- it is more art than operation, with only a couple of tables and 4 chairs -- and the location is interesting.Will return, will return, must return! -- and certainly worth a visit., What an experience! This teensy Thai take-out place-but-sometimes-sit-down-restaurant-if-you-want is a destination, in large part for the food, but also for the sheer uniqueness of the entire place.The food truly blew me away, it was so good. The pad thai, something I normally turn my nose up at due to its too often tendency to glop and bore, was astonishingly, bewilderingly delicious! How could something so traditional and so mainstream -- at least in the world of Thai food aficionados -- be made to such perfection? That is the question. And I believe the answer lies with Thai X-ing humble and fascinating owner and head cook (and waiter and telephone operator). He runs his restaurant / take-out stand like nothing Ie ever experienced in the US. He is a part of the food, and a part of your experience. It is truly a grass-roots story, and fantastically unique in this city slowly being overtaken by nationwide chains.So come here for all of the above. And word on the street is that other Thai places are irked at how his prices are so low. You know, makes them look bad. Make the trek here, even if you don live close. Just remember to call in ahead of time., By all accounts it seems this place is known for being inconsistent, but with the capacity to be good -- but my one experience there seems to be the opposite of most others. We walked in to order the food one evening, but the sole table had been reserved, so we waited for our food to take it out. The red curry and rice were completed in about 15 minutes, which sounds fast compared to other reviewers experiences of an hour or more. Yes, the owner/chef was extremely nice and the space eccentric and quirky, but the red curry lacked in wow. It had a strange aftertaste of an ingredient I have never tasted in a curry before. The Thai iced tea was delicious, which made it difficult to accept that the styrofoam cup it came in was filled top to bottom with ice, and very little deliciousness. Nevertheless Ive been hearing about this place for more than a year, and intend to return to try something hopefully a little tastier (and see this guy again!), Okay, I wont lie, I thought that all those reviews were waaaaaay over the top. I mean, non-whip cream related foods erotic? Really!?Sure enough, I made the call went to pick it up, and my mind was blown.First of all, WOW this place is small!! There were two tables. Id say there is seating room for six, maybe eight MAX. I feel like I am in someones home and they are cooking for me, sweet!Anyway, I ordered for delivery (but apparently their driver was on a hot date or something) so I picked up. We get home turn on lost, and nearly ignore the show.The was a lot different than Thai food Ive had before, it was much less sweet. My Tofu Pad King had a nice thick dusting of pepper on top...GENIUS! I had never had it with enough pepper for me to notice, and I was in love.My Nom tok, beef with mint leaves, scallions and spices, was mind blowing as well.Even if you are totally bored of Thai food like I am, MAKE THE TRIP HERE!!!, I am trying to be nuetral. Pain in the neck to order from/find. Food was fine. I did like the fact that the chef cooked everything to order. I hate eating out of styrofoam. Not sure if I get it., Inconsistent is the best description for Thai X-ing. Yes, this is the cute, authentic little Thai place youe heard about with the one guy who cooks everything to order (So charming!). Mostly for carryout, since there only one table in a cramped room, filled with birds and Thai bric-a-brac (For a second, I really felt like I was *in* Bangkok!). Yeah, the food good and the price is right. Some dishes are even a little better than you can find at other good Thai places around the city. On the other hand, said other places did not keep me waiting in said one cramped room for more an hour after my food was supposed to be ready. That was a particularly bad night, but it always slow and the food is often cold by the time you actually get your carryout. Unless the stars are properly aligned, I would skip it., I used to really like this place. The food as others mentioned can be mind blowing. The dude that owns this place IS super nice and this spot is funky/weird/eclectic. I hope he reads this review and takes it to heart. He is F#$KING up his business and good reputation. He should remember me from this order.I ordered takeout on Sunday 5/11/08. We were having a torrential downpour, and I just felt too lazy to cook after getting home from work. I live in Glover Park, but had a strong craving for some Thai Xing. When I called he said he had a big order just in and it would take one and half hour before my order would be ready (7:36pm called in). I get there at 8:56pm and he says it would be another half an hour. OK. He cooking by himself, the food has always been very good, etc. No problem. I sit in my car and listen to music, make phone calls, text friends and kill 35 minutes. I come back inside and he says still not ready yet. So I wait. And wait. And wait. Finally at 10:16 the order is ready. I look him in the eye and say  that took forever. If the food is really fantastic it will be worth it. And I meant it. I am a trooper. I am forgiving. He says your order was large and to please enjoy and thank you very much. I say thank you and leave and give him a decent tip still.On the drive back to Glover Park I am just starving. Dying. Famished. Finally home, wet and tired I take the lid off the food containers. Oh the horror!!!! Pork Rib in Green Curry - two orders - coconut milk was curdled and chunky, pork was dry and tasteless, no spice. Total blob of shit. I am angry. 8.95 eachRoasted Duck in Red Curry - again curdled coconut milk. Overcooked and tasteless. No spice. No subtlety. Total shit. I am livid. 11.95Pad Thai - Gloopy lump of noodles. Worst than shit from a bad Thai restaurant heated in the microwave. Smoke coming from the ears. 7.95Shrimp fried rice - The shrimp were perfect. The rest of the dish was a again a soggy, mushy mess. My blood is boiling. 8.95I spent two hours and forty minutes waiting for some of the most awful Thai food I have ever experienced. He should be deeply ashamed of himself. First for the bullshit time estimates, but mostly for giving me steaming piles of SHIT after the ridiculously long wait.With his limitations of space and speed he should be doing the underground restaurant thing San Franciscans should be familiar with. I have had some incredible meals in these underground restaurants in SF. Basically it is a nice latina cooking a multicourse meal in her home with all you can eat and drink for anywhere between $20 and $40 per person for a small group of your friends. He would probably do very well with this concept. Maybe one of you guys that knows him better might suggest it to him. He could even do it on a reservation basis. Say eight diners on a fixed limited menu every 2 hours. Thanks for reading., Thai food in DCMDVA usually sucks. But Thai X-ing was a nice change. I almost walked past it because its such a teensey basement place. The place is a little sketch, I think it is registered as a internet cafe. Reading the other reviews, Id have to agree that its not entirely consistent: the prices listed online have changed, I was told they only deliver on Fridays, and I had to wait 20 minutes after I had already called in my order.All the bad things aside, the food was soooo delicious. We got basil-chili chicken (pad pik king), larb gai chicken appetizer, pad thai, pad see-ew, and a curry. Everything was reasonably priced and very tasty. A few things were good spicey. The noodles werent the best Ive had, sounds like one of his off nights. The pad thai was the only disappointment, the sauce was weird.Ill go back, next time Im in the mood for Thai and have a ton of free time., Disclaimer first: if youre in a hurry, DO NOT under any circumstances try to eat here. Even if youre just an impatient person, dont bother.Taw, the owner of Thai X-ing, has the calm of a Zen master and the creativity of an artist. Actually, he is an artist. A few of his drawings and paintings are scattered around the restaurant, and theyre amazing. The man is clearly brilliant. Part of his brilliance is that he doesnt really seem to care about running a moneymaking machine, and I respect the hell out of him for that. He cooks everything to order, and doesnt seem to pre-prep anything besides a few sauces. You can hear him chopping vegetables and mincing garlic after you order. The drawback is that the food is insanely slow sometimes (call ahead--you might literally have to wait two hours), but its always really fresh and really really obscenely good. To echo some of the other yelpers, I think Thai X-ing is the only DC restaurant I would miss if I had to leave the city tomorrow. Outstanding, fresh, creative, tasty food... prepared by a really good dude who deserves your business and admiration.Unless, of course, youre a prick in a hurry. Then please dont bother. Leave Thai X-ing, its four burners, and its six seats to those of us who can really appreciate it., All I have to say is that we waited for about 1 1/2 hrs for our food to be ready (our friends picked it up but still had to wait around a good while), but it was worth it! This did not taste like every other Thai rest out there, it was yummy homestyle done well!, My family and I ordered take-out from here last night as an alternative to my moms home cookin. We called in at 7:00pm and knew it would take at least an hour for all our food to be prepared, especially since we ordered a lot (probably 7-8 dishes). So we got there at 8:30pm and actually ended up waiting for another hour (thats 2.5 hours total!). Im not surprised though, hes all by himself and has a lot of regulars to cater to.So aside from the wait (which took away the 5th star) all I have to say about the food is that this is authentic Thai cooking. Comparable to my moms food (maybe sometimes better...maybe). It felt like I was going over to a Thai friends house for dinner and we had to pay for it. I got Panang beef and Tom Kha Gai -- panang was a bit too sweet for my taste, but the Tom Kha was absolutely delightful (I actually want to go back for some right now). We also ordered some Pad Thai and Drunken Noodles -- Pad Thai here is different from anywhere else Ive had it, he gives it a good kick with i dont know what. The Drunken Noodles were great, really flavorful. We felt kind of bad for ordering so much food because he had to turn away some other customers and close early =/ .As for the decor -- it was not what I imagined AT ALL. It is tiny (7 people would probably fill it up), dark, and has lots of miss-matched, random furniture. The walls are decorated with articles that have reviewed the place, artwork, pictures (of his daughter, I think) and just really, really random stuff. Taw, the chef/owner, seems like a pretty cool guy. My mom tried to engage in some friendly conversation with him, but he seemed really focused on the cooking).Overall, it was a nice change from all these big Thai restaurants that have popped up in the past 10 years.I suggest that you dont order as much food as I did and that you call WAY ahead of time. We also wanted to get the lobster curry, but he said we should call a whole day ahead for that.EDIT: I would say go here if youve never eaten homestyle Thai before, otherwise Im not sure if it is worth the wait., Other reviews have covered the key points of Taw Thai X-ing. My buddy showed me this place and he ordered ahead of time. We still ended up waiting, but my friend brought some pale ales to drink in the meantime. Taw was also working by himself until later when he got some volunteer help.While we were there, Taw showed some of his artwork to customers, talked to my friend, and made for us four completely different dishes with different tastes, textures, temperatures, and sauces. I felt like it was a complete Thai experience, and I don have that feeling much when I go out to eat. What a genuinely delicious, and extremely inexpensive, meal!Definitely a place you never find on your own, with only a neon OPEN sign out front and an empty menu placard outside. Definitely a delightful DC quirk., More things you should know about Thai X-ing .....1. Hes expanded! There is more room to sit down and even a table outside.2. Today, unbelievably, I ordered my food via phone and was told to pick up in a 1/2 hour and it was ready in 1/2 hour! Wooo Hoooooo!!!!! I didnt recognize the person working there - maybe hes hired someone and this is the reason for the efficiency?3. When I mentioned erotic, I was thinking of the green curry. 4. And the food today was fabulous!, What could a white girl from Illinois who hasn been to Thailand possibly know about Thai food? Only that she likes it. A lot. And living in Seattle, there is no shortage of excellent thai options (e.g. Thai Tom on the Ave., Jamjuree in Capitol Hill). But I wasn so sure about Thai food in DC. I know of the city reputation for being highly diverse is reflected in its food options. But Southeast Asian cuisine? I must investigate.Thai X-ing is apparently well known among Yelpers for its poor service and excellent food. It also right down the street from where I living, so it was a logical choice on a particular afternoon I didn feel like cooking (for the next three days). Attempt #1: Sorry we close in two hours but wee not taking any more orders. Damn.Attempt #2: Sorry wee closed on Mondays even though our website says wee open. Fair enough. I could justify being upset if I myself knew how to edit a webpage.Attempt #3: So that one chicken pad thai and a red curry with tofu? Ready in 45 minutes.During the extra 15 minutes I waited for my food, I sat in the super-cozy, and virtually empty downstairs dining area (see other reviews for more on the ambience), reading one of the many old books the restaurant has apparently acquired from the public library. As I put away my book, I tried to make conversation with the server--the white girl from Virginia who HAS been to Thailand. Wow! I just learned more about the state of Alabama than I could ever imagine knowing! Snubbed by server. Whatever, I here for the food.And here the food. The red curry was...okay. I a fan of fish sauce and they glob that stuff in, so that was a plus. The spice level was adequate but I coulde used more. Good tofu.The pad thai was...soupy. And bean-sprouty. I prefer to take my mung-bean sprouts dipped in duck sauce before my pho arrives. In pad thai, I see them as a sorry substitution for what could be more noodles. When I went back to finish the dish the next day (don worry, it was refrigerated), the thing was so unbearable I ended up (gasp) throwing it out. Even soupier and what seemed to be bean-sproutier than the first time around!Will I go again? Nope. The expected mediocre-to-poor service wasn a problem for me. But lousy pad thai? Life too short., I admit my last visit was about 2 months ago so things may have improved.This is right in my neighborhood & the first time we came here we were overjoyed to find great Thai food within walking distance. Heck, it was so good that we would have been overjoyed to merely find the place.As time went on, the serving sizes decreased & the waiting times increased. Our last visit will continue to be our last visit. We were told when we called that the wait would be 1 1/2 hrs. OK, we agreed to that. Called before leaving to pick up & told that hed need another 1/2 hr. Got there & food still wasnt ready for more than 1/2 additional. For those who have math difficulties. Over 2 1/2 wait for dinner. He hadnt even started preparing our food before we got there. I suggest that you order your dinner around lunchtime.Flavor good as always however the panang chicken curry was appetizer size & contained 3 SMALL pieces of chicken. Our other dishes were also teeny. If you have to raise prices do so. He started out with smaller serving sizes than Ive had anywhere other than a tapas bar however this is ridiculous. Expect to order twice as much as in your usual Thai restaurant., Absolutely unreal. The place is surreal. The food is amazing. I got the Chicken Viggatssaboot. Best Thai food in history, DELICIOUS food, very savory, fresh, and flavorful. Best Thai food Ie had in a long time. Nice hole-in-the-wall type place too.The place was neat, with lots of things to look at, read, admire. The little plants and the grape vines with grapes draping over the entrance were charming. The service could be better. This was a take out place for dinner daily, but we got there and the guy said, Do you have a reservation? Did you call first? NO? Sorry, wee all booked for the rest of the evening. Granted he did take our order after we explained that it was our first time checking this place out . Also, the online menu is outdated. There are no dinner combos. Despite all, I would definitely come again for the food, though would call ahead at least 15minutes, maybe 30 minutes., I had read the other reviews, so I knew what to expect. Still I was surprised at the first question: Do you have a reservation? I quizzically looked around the empty living room area and said no, and we were told to come back in 30 minutes (He had alot of takeout orders). After 30 minutes at the velvet lounge (listening to inspector gadget and the sesame street soundtrack) we came back. I moved a pile of mail off of one of the chairs and we ordered our food. I got the salmon red curry and my girlfriend got the panang tofu. It certainly took a while to come, but it was very good. The salmon curry had lots of flavor, excellent eggplant and lots of herbs that are not found in typical americanized thai food. My girlfriends tofu was a little chewy, but the sauce was delicious. The owner was an interesting guy and liked to talk about his well deserved washingtonian awards. Despite the long waits and a hot eating area, it was well worth the effort. There are lots of things on the menu to try, so my rating could change after more visits., Definitely good thai. We also ordered three or so hours in advance, and when we showed up we got to sit down immediately at a table for two and had a big pitcher of water for us. Our satay came out immediately, and it was very good, though a bit small for the price. The peanut sauce was the most amazing thing ever. I hate peanut sauce, but when I tasted it I was in heaven. I licked the container.We had drunken noodle (with tofu--I had ordered chicken, but apparently he misheard me) and panang chicken. Both were good, and the sauce for the panang was the most delicious Id ever tasted. The reason I gave it four and not five is that the portions were a bit small. There were probably only about five pieces of chicken in the panang. But like I said, the taste... oh, the taste., A few rules if you want to have the five-star experience:1. You must reserve, probably EXACTLY AT 4pm when they open. Or should I say, he opens? Taw runs the place pretty much by himself.2. Do not go when it hot outside.3. You will have to order your food when you reserve.4. Don plan to eat on a schedule, make the dinner your night event.5. Don be in a hurry in general.6. If youe eating in, don come in a group larger than four people.7. The closer you eat to 10pm (closing time), the more likely it is that Taw will hang out and not be cooking. ;-)The food here is amazing. It legit, delicious, and will burn your face off with spice (in a good way). It also insanely cheap, I had dinner for two and one take out order for $27.I personally endorse the drunken noodles and panang chicken, both were stellar. You have to get over the restaurant, which I am pretty sure is a room in Taw house. There are knick knacks all over, it not very open, and it dimly lit. But for me, that adds to the character of the place.My highest recommendation for a wonderful dinner and experience., No question, this is the best Thai food in DC and the best Ive ever had anywhere.You have to know what youre getting yourself into before you go: Even though you order your food when you make a reservation, he doesnt start cooking it till you get there. This becomes an issue because if there are other people waiting for food, itll take 20-60 min for your food to be served.If its hot out, make sure to take some cold beers because its BYOB and they dont have air conditioning. In the winter months, I usually take a bottle of wine.The panang chicken is amazing and a must try!, I almost didn want to write this review because I want to keep it my little secret. Thai X-ing really does have the most authentic Thai food in the area. Chef Taw cooks everything himself and sometimes does everything else too! The restaurant looks like someone basement - filled with Chef Taw drawings, a swamp looking fish tank, various furniture, and un-matching cups/plates. There literally only 3 tables inside plus one table on the patio.You MUST call and make a reservation AND place your order ahead of time. And even if you do place your order (for dine in or carryout) expect a wait. Don go in with a I the customer attitude. BYOB and just enjoy the food and the atmosphere.I recommend the Yum Nua appetizer, Salmon w/ Red Curry, Chicken Pad Pik King, and Drunken Noodles. All the dishes have more veggies than you are probably used to. Don forget to finish the night with Mango with Sticky Rice.-1 star for accessibility, Wld be 3 stars, but the fact that we ordered take out and 90 minutes later our food has not been started makes the difference. Great food, service was poorer than poor., 5 out of 5 NOMOMOMsI typically dont care much for Thai, but this place is just awesome. Good thing this place is so busy or Id order here every other day. Eccentric homegrown restaurant presentation with appropriately delicious food.Best panang Ive had. Larb gai and yum woon sen are types of appetizers I usually avoid, but theyre quite interesting and flavorful. Thai X-ing curry is quite awesome with an earthy taste., The mythology about this place is all true. The food takes forever to prepare. By the time you get the food, your appetite is gone or ravenous. The takeout is cold by the time you get it. Why bother with the hassle?, Thai X-ing is an experience. Do not go for a quick dinner or to get take-out on the go. You go to Thai X-ing to sit back, relax, soak up the quirky ambiance and enjoy life at a slower pace. All while your authentic Thai food is custom prepared one order at a time- thats why it takes longer, theres only one cook! The prices are hard to beat- BYOB for one thing and the dishes are around $8-12. I went with friends and we ordered 5 dishes to share and it was $17 each including a generous tip. And we were stuffed. I suggest allotting 2 hrs. min. to really enjoy Thai X-ing. CALL AHEAD. If they dont call you back right away, be aware they might call you the day you want to go with a last minute opening, thats just the way they operate, go with the flow. The Panang Curry and stir-fry are favorites. The Pumpkin Curry with pork is out of this world., Make a night of it.Taw is one of the most gracious hosts in the city as long as you give him the time to do what he needs to do. Bring your own beer (with extra for Taw), plan on eating an hour or two after your reservation, and be prepared for the best Thai food arond.Suggestions:I had been there several times before discovering the Thai Tea, which cuts the hot like a dream and is otherwise sweet and delicious. I will never turn that down again.Pumpkin curry has been the universal favorite of everyone I have taken to Thai crossing (its a special). Get it.Bring people you care about - youll be spending a lot of time with them., Best Thai food in DC. I felt like chef Tau invited me to his house for a private dinner party. The selection of dishes is not huge, but everything was deeply flavorful, and served up on homey, mismatched crockery atop banana leaves. The mango fried rice was...not sticky, not heavy, but creamy and FLUFFY~! How does he manage that?!NOTE: This place is run by an artist more so than by a business man. Make sure to call between 12PM - 4PM to make reservations (you have to place your orders at the same time), or even for takeout. Contrary to the voicemail message that he would call you back if you left a message--if he doesnt pick up, hes probably done with taking orders for the night. It took us 8 futile calls one sunny Saturday before we learned our lesson. I cannot stress enough on the calling-early part--the dinning area has 3 tables and 1 table outside (rendering it unavailable in winter), and seats about 2 to 3 people per table... it fills up fast!, Well. It certainly different from your usual Thai place. Or really ANY restaurant in general.Youe eating in somebody garden level apartment den. And the kitchen is about 5 steps away. So for authenticity this is as good as it gets. BYOB is a great feature. However, if you want atmosphere eqivalent to many popular Thai places, don go here. But if you want something COMPLETELY unique and unexpected. Try it out. I suggest going during the week and calling ahead right at 4pm (when they open) to place your order. Tau rolls pretty much by himself or, at most, with one assistant.This has to be the most authentic Thai cusine in Washington. You get the sense Tau is using recipies that have been in his family for generations. If Florida Ave. wasn right outside the door you might think you were in Thailand., My husband and I have been meaning to eat at this place but never had a chance to until this weekend. I have read good reviews about this place so we were excited to check it out. I called around 12 nn on Saturday to make a reservation. I spoke to Tau who is the owner/manager/receptionist/cook. At first he told me they were completely booked for the night but said the 6 pm reservation has not been reconfirmed. He asked me to give him a call back after 30 mins to check whether he can squeeze us in or not. I called back and thankfully, the 6 pm reservation has not been reconfirmed so he gladly gave the spot for us. Since it was our first time to go there, I did not know that we have to give our orders by phone ahead of time. I had to check with my husband what he would like to eat and gave Tau a call back. Here how our conversation went:Me: I would like to order salmon curry, pla lad prik (rockfish with garlic chili sauce), panang tofu and shrimp pad thai (to go). Taw: That is too much food for two people?Me: Yeah, it okay. We LOVE to eat :-). LOL! At the back of my mind I was thinking You don know us. We CAN certainly EAT lol. Tau did warn us that the rockfish is big. He also mentioned that he has not gone to the market yet so we know his ingredients for dinner will be fresh! Thai Xing is a few blocks walk from our house so it was very convenient. We had a 5:45 pm reservation. We left our house at 5 pm so we had plenty of time to walk around the neighborhood. We walked up U St. to pass the time but we still got to Thai X-ing a tad early. The place is not really a restaurant. It basically a small living room with 3 small tables. The whole place can only sit about 10-11 people at a time. From our table, we can see the kitchen and we were fascinated to see that some of the ingredients/spices that Tau uses are the exact same ones that we buy from the oriental store. Tau had to bring out another small table for us since the food we ordered would not fit on our table :-). The food was great. They were very rich in flavor. Traditional Thai food cooking indeed. The rockfish was freaking huge but good nonetheless. Too bad I did not take any photos of the food. Eating at Thai Xing is like eating at somebody else house. We like that we have a neighborhood Thai place that we can go to. We will definitely be back! Gotta try the mango sticky rice next time we come back., Uper-yummy thai food. The spice-weary need not apply. Since moving from Seattle, we have been looking for yummy, spicy thai food. We do to-go, because we live around the corner. Dont go there expecting a romantic dinner, though. As others have noted, you basically are sharing the room with the cooks. Call ahead on the weekends to make sure there is space -- even for to-go orders! Also, do not expect a super huge portion size. Its just enough to get you full. The price is fair for DC standards., Ok... I read the reviews and I must say that I AM STILL BLOW AWAY. I have not stopped bragging about finding this place since I went.Tau is incredible, the food is absolutely delicious and 100% authentic and the cozy homey atmosphere is out of this world, you literally feel like you have taken a plane across the Pacific. Tau even showed us his artwork and let us watch him cook!Basically, this is what I have been telling all my friends: I found a place in DC right by Rhode island and Florida ave where this guy came over from Thailand and bought a little row house, he then invites you inside and you go and sit in his living room (in his basement) and then you watch him cook for you! It is like having a private chef! You MUST make reservations ahead of time since he only has 3 tables, it has a very exotic, rustic, and intimate feel. He had a little candle burning at our table. As far as food goes, skip the pad Thai and head straight to the real Thai food, I had the Chicken Panang and WOWOWOWOWOW!! So delicious, it was almost like a spicy pumpkin curry, I have already decided that I will be coming back here on a regular basis, This is a fantastic, and really special place. I went last night with a friend, and had an incredible meal. The atmosphere was lovely, warm and eclectic and the service was friendly and sufficiently prompt.I made a reservation earlier in the week, and ordered a chefs choice vegan menu for two. I highly suggest going this route! We first had fried veggie spring rolls (YUM!), and then a phenomenal eggplant dish, and a tofu panang curry (spicy, creamy uber-deliciousness). We brought our own tasty beer. Since Im moving to this hood at the end of the month, I have a feeling Ill be spending a lot of time at this place..., TONITE......WOW......did I luck out......had choices of The Old Siam Cap Hill OR Siam House Cleveland Park on my mind BUT made a serious detour to U St. Cardozza Metro and walked 6 blocks to THAI XING......I was there around 5 SO YES PEOPLE I got the first order in TONITE :() WHOOOOOOOOOOOOO WEEEEE!!!!!!!!Went for the Pumpkin Curry chicken special and it was devine!!!!!!!! You can tell when you taste Taws cooking because he takes his sweet ass time (he is the man though) and really lets the meats and curries marinate and settle into a serious masterpiece......expediter Done yet Taw? A few more minutes says Taw.....my dish had been simmering for 20+ minutes :) Delectible pieces of chicken and pumpkin and the pumpkin curry finger licking good......almost didnt want to add any rice to it..... with DC tax $17 but sooooo worth it.....he had 3,4 parties booked and the one of 15 at 6PM would take up his whole apt.....uh I mean dining area so I scaddled outta there and have just now finished my meal at my office in Bethesda. Taw has a great Thai asst and another guy who helps to cook and expedite the food. It is a tight ship he runs but to hang out there with the pics of his daughters the fish and the lone lovebird chirping away is very surreal......., Thai X-ing--hands down, the best and most traditional Thai food Ive ever had--is a unique establishment in just about every factor associated with eating. For one, it is located on the ground level floor of an otherwise nondescript, neatly gated rowhouse. A second curiosity is the need to call a few days in advance to make reservations and, yes, place the order (to which the chef shops)! Thirdly, the whole place seats--very tightly--10-12 people in an eclectic, exclusively candle-lit dining room with a multitude of knick-knacks ranging from old photos and statuettes to a bird cage (sans bird) and fish tank. Though the atmosphere is a (Thai) cross between a hide-out bunker and your peculiar greataunts well-lived in country home, your BYOB take-alongs should ease any transitional apprehensions.From most spots in the dining room, one can see the chef busily crafting in the brightly lit kitchen the incredibly fresh, herb and veggie-concentrated made-to-order dishes. We had spring rolls and yum woon sen for apps with Thai X-ing stir fry, pad king, panang curry, and pad kana for the main course. Though all dishes (save for the out-of-season sweet mango-sticky rice dessert) were phenomenal and deliciously spicy-hot, our waitress was often unable to indicate the identity of specific plates. Thank goodness for incidentally ordering diverse meats and for textural uniqueness of cream-based curry that helped with the guessing game! This glitch aside, the traditional presentation of each item on a plate-sized banana leaf (except for the bowled curry) tickled the senses, practically giving the elusion of being in some bungalow on an exotic island. I simply cannot wait to go back but might do take out next time as I want to expose more people to the magic served here without the space constraints of inviting my closest 2-4 peeps., Wow! Thats all I can say about this place. A very surreal experience, great food in someones living room. Quite possibly the best thai food Ive ever had!!!The whole experience started a week before we actually ate. I called in to make reservations (something I highly recommend, leave a message and a contact number). A few hours later I get a call back saying that they couldnt accommodate me that evening so I had to push back the reservation for the next week. I also called in a few days before to let them know what we were going to eat (like everyone said, this is a small restaurant).When we got to the restaurant I showed up with a 12 pack of carona (its BYOB) and sat at one of 3 tables in the restaurant. We could see right into the kitchen to watch as our food was prepared. The appetizers came out relatively quickly and were the perfect balance of heat and flavor served on a banana leaf. The main courses continued the tasty experience, the penang curry was full of flavor and the chicken vigsittiboot an amazing new dish.For desert we had the mango sticky rice. Compared to the rest of the meal it was a little bit of a disappointment. Maybe it was because the mango wasnt completely ripe, or maybe because the rest of the meal was just so damn good. The rice was good, but the mango was a little hard.Ill definitely be coming back, this place is awesome!, Dont miss it, best in town!!Senator Cantwell is also down - she was in the tiny basement too, right next to our table. So DC celebs aprove too!, Great, very unique place! Very small place, so dont expect anything incredible if you decide to dine here. Just basic tables and chairs thrown together to make the most of the space available.Loses the 5-star because of the smaller portions coupled with expensive prices. I had the pumpkin chicken curry and it was fantastic. Smooth yet flavorful with every bite. My gf had the Chicken Vigsittaboot, and it was refreshing and light. We also got the mango and sticky rice which was really really good. Very happy with the experience.Chef and atmosphere very cool!Dont bother with the spring rolls. They are tiny and nothing special about them., Excellent excellent thai food. Concept sounds like a gimmick, but the food delivers., What a wonderful hidden gem tucked away in Shaw. We had a fantastic meal with Tom Yum Goong and Spring Rolls for an appetizer. The soup smelled amazing! For our main course, we had green curry with chicken (soo good), chicken panang, salmon with red curry (a crowd favorite), and drunken beer noodle. Contrary to other reviews, I think the prices are very reasonable and its BYOB (which definitely saves money), just be discreet. The atmosphere is cozy and Tau definitely lives up to his reputation as a zen chef - producing some truly memorable food. Ill definitely be back!, While this was definitely the best Thai food Ive ever had, it was also just a great all around event. We took a friend visiting from out of town, eager to show her a unique DC experience and Thai Xing delivers. It was definitely critical to call ahead. We made reservations a week ahead of time and placed our order several days beforehand. We had the pumpkin curry, Tofu with lime curry, Drunken noodles, and another chicken curry- each was delicious and flavorful. I was initially worried the portions would be too small, but it turned out to be exactly the right amount of food. Pricing was standard for DC- $8 to $12 per entree, and it was miles better than any other Asian food Ive had in the city. We also brought our own beer, which is a nice option. The place is tiny- literally in a dimly lit, crowded front room- and our table was practically in the kitchen. While we enjoyed the scene, Im sure its not for everyone- tables and chairs are rather haphazard and smaller groups of two were even eating off of what seemed to be a large tv tray. I would say the food and ambiance is worth a little discomfort, but its something to keep in mind. Any group larger than 6 would be impossible to accommodate at one table here, and 6 is pushing it. I dont think theyd seat more than 10 people in the whole place. Our food came out extremely quickly and we werent there for much longer than an hour- there were people waiting and it was cold outside, so we felt guilty lingering. Next time Id plan to go during the week and later so we might get a chance to chat with the chef!While I almost hate to spread the word about this place, its so good weve been telling basically everyone to go- you definitely will not regret it., Best Thai food Ive had outside of Thailand. Hands down., This place is disgusting. I cannot believe the reviews about it - must have been written by the owner friends.It is filthy, there is no service to speak of, and a very limited and unappealing menu. I have been to Thailand and eaten at many Thai restaurants and this is the absolute worst.If you insist on going here to prove your Cool Kid credentials do not use the restroom - the trip through the Superfund site kitchen and then the actual experience of the nasty restroom will put you even more off the food.Picture bad take out food served in a home featured on the show Hoarders., Original Review from 7/4/09 visit: The food is amazing and competitively priced but the service is very slow. I last went here on the 4th of July but didn tip because it took him over a half hour to let me pay him. My girlfriend had come in from out of town and we missed all but the final fireworks because he was so incredibly slow. I haven gone back since but I probably will soon. The food is just too good and the place is so unique. The pictures make it look bigger than it is.Updated Review from 1/29/11 visit: I went here Saturday night for a $40 five course meal. It was amazing and worth every penny. They served a spicy thai seafood soup, curry with pumpkin and I believe salmon, chicken and eggplant, pad see ew with chicken, and a delicious rice pudding with mango. Every dish was amazing. It was a ton of food though. I would recommend going in extra hungry.The only negative is that we were seated on very short chairs that looked like foot rests. We were able to get comfortable though and could have moved to any of the other tables that had proper chairs if we had wanted to. When you go here it as much about the atmosphere as the food. It feels like you are eating in somebody house and is actually decorated with family photos and even a Smith Dad coffee mug. The fact that its byob, with no corkage fee, is also very nice., First time last night! Called 2 days in advance for Thursday night reservations and he could get us (2) in at 7:45. Came about 7:35 with a 6 pack and were seated in the front table next to the fish tank and the birdcage. Our Nam Tok was out in about 10 min, SO yummy. I have not eaten anything like it. So many seasonings that I couldnt pin point one. I had the pumpkin curry which melted in my mouth and was amazing! BF had Bankok chicken which was fresh and really outstanding. I was, however, disappointed in one thing.... myself. I was SO excited to try mango sticky rice since everyone loves it and id never had it. I dont like mango sticky rice. :( It stems i think from my dislike of bread pudding and soggy things. OH well. the mango was fresh and yummy! We gave Tau a couple beers and thanked him for an awesome meal. Great food in a fun atmosphere!Like everyone else said, call ahead, order ahead. Go to the website. Its awesome. Try not to be there when I want to go back though!, So one of my goals for the year is to try one new thing for each week of the year. What better site to help me find new places than Yelp and what better restaurant to start this adventure than Thai X-ing. I read some of the other reviews on this location and decided that it would be an interesting adventure. Adventure isnt quite what I got, but I did have a great evening and a great meal. I planned on visiting and dinning in on Wednesday night. Thanks to reading the previous reviews I called ahead of time. Unfortunately I found the restaurant on Yelp over the weekend and didnt try to call until Monday (Thai X-ing is closed on Monday). After calling back Tuesday we were able to get a reservation for Wednesday night. Calling ahead was definitely key. As we were eating a number of groups came in and had to order, then come back later in the night.Now Im not a huge D.C. expert so I plugged the address in my GPS and off I went. Parking was extremely easy on Wednesday night. There were plenty of street spots very close to the restaurant. Wednesday night was really cold. Can we say bonus points!! The area around the restaurant seemed a little shady but I think the previous reviews made it worth the visit.Once inside the restaurant we were met with a friendly greeting and a soft comfortable atmosphere. There was another group of two with reservations at the same time so that almost lead to a mishap, but we recognized it ahead of time and crisis averted.The remainder of the dinner was nothing but amazing. We started with the Tom Yum Soup with vegetables. The portions were large and the soup was just the right amount of spice (a little bit of perspiration without full on sweat attack). The herbs and spices were extremely refreshing.The entree of drunken noodles was fantastic. This is my typical first visit fare. I like to use it as my benchmark for a new Thai restaurant. I must say they had a different slant on drunken noodles. They are often drenched heavily in sauce which can take away from the ingredients. This dish, did i mention it was actually served on banana leaves!, felt like it was truly authentic. I must say I am really excited to try out several of the other menu items in the future. Ill definitely go back.As this is the first of my Yelp reviews and I was introduced to Yelp by a good friend Seab H., Ill leave you with my first and only Yelp Haiku:Call the comfort caveGreeted with delicious spiceFantastic times had, First, please note that as of this writing, the Yelp info is wrong: reservations are absolutely required. Why? Because the place has maybe a dozen chairs, dispersed among haphazardly placed tables in the front of the townhouse. This aint Thaiphoon, where a team of waiters will seat you while a team of faceless chefs prepare food in the back. No, the kitchen is right there, and to my eye looks somewhat larger than the seating area.Enough about the guest-at-a-chefs-house ambiance: the food was great. Since the chef was taking my reservations, he could ask my preferences and cook to my tastes. No worries that there could be fish sauce in a vegan dish here. Ill leave the food porn to those who are better at writing this stuff, but it was fabulous., This place is so unique, it very small, mismatched, cozy. You may or may not have an appropriate seating situation for your group, or you may not even get what you ordered several days in advance, but hands down, this was such a great foodie experience. The pumpkin curry with tofu was zesty, but full of flavor. We think our orders were jumbled due to the heavy recent snowfall, and the owner came out with a tofu soup, which is still making me drool, based on what our original order was and he concocted it with what he had in the kitchen. The soup, with a hint of cilantro, lemongrass, and curry was phenomenal, unlike anything Ie ever had. The BYOB concept was great, we even brought our own wine and corkscrew, no questions asked. This place is definitely an experience and I can readily appreciate the uniqueness of having a one-man show (the owner is also the cook, server, and busboy). Definitely recommend this as one of the best Thai places Ie ever eaten at., I was considering not writing a review, because this place seems like such an underground gem and I dont really want people to go...but 69 reviews means it cant be a secret.Very cool idea...very small, must order ahead and make reservations. I didnt eat a whole meal because I met some friends there. Plan on going back this week for a full meal and I will update then. It gets 4 stars just for the way they run things. I hear that Tau takes on newbie chefs who want to learn how to cook Thai food...how cool is that. This feels like the kind of place that builds community., Dude, This place is phenomenal, in all aspects that a restaurant could be great in. The atmosphere is like nothing Ive ever experienced: its literally a tiny basement, with two tables and a desk for people to eat at, yet somehow, it works.The food is delicious. The chefs are super friendly, and will do their best to make the experience great. I highly, highly recommend Thai X-ing., A little while ago my roommate told me about a place called Thai X-ing, not far from our house. I decided to check it out one night, and I have not been to any other Thai restaurants in DC since then. The restaurant is as much about the entire experience as it is about the food, which is very very good. While going out to eat can almost seem monotonous with robot-like servers, loud dining rooms with cramped-together tables, and absolutely no connection between the diner and the chef making the food, Thai X-ing has completely the opposite. First, you have to make a reservation AND order your dishes well in advance. This is done to allow Chef Taw ample time in preparing each dish and buying the ingredients that are required. While this may be frustrating to Americans who are used to very accommodating restaurants, especially since calling several times may be necessary for you to get a reservation, this is quickly overlooked once you arrive. The restaurant is on the ground floor of a rowhouse in a up-and-coming part of DC, the Shaw neighborhood. You can walk right past the entrance, which is marked with a wooden THAI X-ING sign and lots of random jungle-like decorations. It can certainly be mistaken for the front facade of a building of an eccentric person who go carried away with decorating. Once you walk through the dark entryway, you enter the candle-lit dining room, which has 3 tables. The tables and chairs follow no particular design scheme...if it feels like youe sitting in someone house, that because you are. There is a birdcage with a parakeet chirping quietly in the corner, plenty of Asian trinkets and artifacts, and random books and permits lining the dining room. Sometimes Taw is by himself, sometimes he is helped by a cadre of loyal volunteers who help in the kitchen and as servers. Beer and wine are not served, but you can bring your own, as long as you are discreet.Onto the food. The attention to detail and authentic, fresh ingredients are what makes the food really stand out. Each plate is lined with banana leaves that have been frozen in Thailand and imported to the US. The Red Curry with Duck is extremely rich, with a creamy coconut milk based sauce and super-tender duck leg and thigh that falls off the bone. The soups are all tangy and pungent. Everything Ie had (about half the menu) has been extremely palatable, but some dishes may be too spicy for some (such as the Yum Nuea, Spicy Beef Salad).For dessert, the Mango with Sticky Rice is a winner as long as the Mango is ripe. The place accepts credit cards (to my pleasant surprise). If you go in with an open mind for a dining experience unlike any other, youl most certainly walk away with a full stomach and a smile on your face. You may even want to make reservations for your next Thai X-ing meal before leaving., Last Sunday evening, Liz and I joined our friends Adam and Sarah for dinner at a place that had long been on our list to visit, Thai X-ing. Now you may have heard about Thai X-ing, either by name or as the place where there are only enough tables for ten people, where you have to call ahead both to make a reservation and to place your order, and where the chef often doubles as waiter, triples as maitre d, and quadruples as busboy.We had heard quite a bit about the restaurant, but experiencing it is something entirely different.Thai is one of our favorite cuisines, and while we still havent experienced some of the traditional favorites in South Arlington (Bangkok 54, Duangrats and Thai Square), weve probably been to about a dozen or so Thai restaurants in the D.C. area. Our main takeaway from that experience is that American Thai food, while tasty, is largely the same experience from place to place. For example, a panang tofu dish will vary somewhat, with more heat at Caf39 Asia, more kaffir lime and basil at Kanlaya, and more peanuts at Sala Thai, but its going to be a very similar dish. Not only that, the experience is often so similar that it can seem like Thai places in D.C. are all franchises of the same outfit. The menus are often identical (both in offerings and in the fonts that are used) and the d39cor is predictable, combining elements of faux rock surfaces with shiny neon colors evocative of a mid-1990s Trapper Keeper.One thing I can say for certain is that Thai X-ing will never be mistaken for one of those places. First, you have to call ahead to place your reservation (and you should also call at least a day in advance to place your order with Tau Vigsittaboot, the chef). Then you have to find the place, which is essentially a barely-marked basement apartment on Florida Ave, NW. Then once you get there, you will wedge yourself into whatever seating arrangement is available in the dark, low-ceilinged living room that serves as the restaurants dining area. But enough about the experience - the best reason to hit up Thai X-ing is the food.And the food was amazing. We had ordered spring rolls and pork satay for starters, the spring rolls were perfectly good (though not amazing) and the satay was unavailable. But then the entrees began to roll out, and they were almost transcendent. The panang tofu was on the hot side, fiery with garlic and chiles, and much thinner than the typical recipe, which is often drowning in its coconut milk base. The pad thai was excellent with both wider and fewer noodles than expected; and the salmon in red curry was one of the highlights among our table. For me, the pumpkin curry, a current special, was worth the trip all by itself. All of the dishes use considerably more vegetables than a typical Thai restaurant and as Chef Tau handles all of the ingredients, the flavors--whether ginger or lemongrass, garlic or chili--come across in a more raw, fierce, and sensory experience.The experience isnt for everyone, and its definitely not a romantic place to take a date. I was wedged into a corner between a gurgling fish tank and a caged parakeet, and we had a house cat watching us throughout the meal (see below). The restaurant is BYOB, which adds to the charm of what youre doing, aka, dining in a dark basement.But if you like spicy Thai food, or if youre looking for an off-the-beaten path D.C. experience, this one will not disappoint. Just dont forget to call ahead, twice!, I had never heard about this place until I was surprised and taken here for my birthday. It was absolutely amazing, and hands down the best Thai food Ive had outside of Thailand. The service was great and friendly and super amendable.....just remember to BYOB.The only caveat, if you are looking for a trendy spot, this is not your place. It is warm cozy and great for two. Not to mention, 60$ for a 5 course meal for two is pretty great in DC! I will be going back soon!, Ordered a week in advance for takeout. Owner called to confirm menu. Had 2 curries, tom soup and a dessert. When we went to pick it up, there was almost a 60 min wait. I didnt understand that part. How do you wait for a takeout, ESP when youve ordered a week (and confirmed a day before) in advance? I get that the owner cooks everything from scratch, but cmon, 60min wait? Maybe I just have really high expectations for asian restaurants. I feel cheated if the food isnt up to par or we end up spending a lot more than if we were to cook at home. The food did taste pretty good however. Expect lots of coconut milk. Not sure if it was worth the wait though. Price was def cheap. You just have to be super patient to dine/take out from this joint! Good luck!, Youve either never heard of this place, in which case pick up the phone right now for your reservation (we called 2 weeks in advance) OR you already knew about this place/have your reservation/and are anxiously awaiting. My stummy (yeah, thats tummy and stomach in one word) is sooo happy right now. Went here for dinner on a Wed night, and the 3 of us had the chefs special. I dont know everything we ate (pumpkin curry sounds familiar, recognized pad thai, some soup, some spicy salad, sticky mango rice), but everything was FRESH, SPICY, and TASTY (and the capital letters prove it).
67|the-bespoke-kitchen-washington|Incredible, locally-sourced tasting menu with super friendly and knowledgeable chefs. I was there with friends for the roots themed menu. Our meal featured chicken liver mousse (I hate liver and licked my plate clean!), scallop ceviche, lobster bisque, BEET tartar, duck breast with turnips, rutabaga ravioli, melt-in-your-mouth short ribs and parsnip creme brulee.The lobster bisque had whole chunks of lobster and grapefruit and was the best dish of the night. Seriously delicious and outstanding. The beet tartar was also fabulous - totally different and the chef took the time to explain the 36+hour process they took to make beet tartar (actually, a lot more complicated than beef tartar surprisingly!).The duck, ravioli and short ribs were all equally scrumptious and the parsnip creme brulee was out of this world. I left feeling warm, full and wanting to go another time.Bottom line - you feel like youe at casual and intimate dinner party, the chefs and servers are really inviting and will tell you everything you wanted to know about the food/drink, and the menu will blow your mind. Can wait to go back!, The place offers a unique dining experience and phenomenal food ! If you are a foodie and are looking for new tastes and food-drink pairs, I strongly recommend it. The chefs are friendly, creative and knowledgeable and the environment is cozy and inviting. Dinners are served based on weekly themes, which makes the dining experience a single journey through a variety of twists on familiar tastes. Bravo !, Excellent meal. Love the concept. An eight course meal pair with drinks, cooked fresh that evening by a great chef just for you. There is only one seating per night. There are only eight places. There is only one menu and there is only one The Bespoke Kitchen. If you are lucky enough to be able to get a reservation you are in for a treat. The emphasis is is on Fresh, Organic and LOCAL!!!!, The chefs table within the catering kitchen - a innovative and fun concept.The meal prepared for the special event hosted - you dont know what you get until you arrive there. Seating limited to 8 - meet terrific new people. Food is excellent and the atmosphere just simply fun. A casual fun dining experience with amazing food and drinks to top it off. Get your table because they sell out fast and each meal theme will be different. Needless to say: We will be back. They also cater events and deliver meals to individuals!, Bespoke Kitchen, I believe, is an outpost of Eat & Smile catering, which I had sampled at a previous private event. Living nearby, I was very interested when the venue opened, though they had been operating for nearly a year before I was able to try it. Bespoke offers pre-fixe menus designed as a surprise for guests at a small communal 10-seat table. Only a curtain offers a little privacy for the chefs in the kitchen, who come out with the host to explain each tasting course. Because it is more of a tasting menu, portions are small, but very thoughtfully designed and presented with local ingredients where possible. The cocktails were excellent and I do suggest purchasing the drink pairing, you must sign up to receive consistent notices about when and what theme will be served. However, be prepared for a little confusion when you arrive; we were not greeted by a host, though they are sometimes up front. You simply walk in and take a seat of choice at the table, which offers little elbow room. Be sure to give the host your name as they check this off their ticket list. Seating can be very awkward if there are groups of 3+ at the table, since they do not engage fellow diners and it feels like you are intruding or vice versa. Its basically a dinner party with strangers, so the chemistry can be unpredictable--although the shared interest in food has led to some great suggestions from other diners. Also, please pay close attention to the e-mail that says no substitutions. Please notify them in advance via e-mail of any actual allergies if you can. I found about one third of the table asked last minute to have or not have something included, again, its pre-fixe, mostly a surprise, and a tasting menu. It is not made *TO* your personal taste. Its rude to the chef and awkward for other diners, when you ask to have an alternative prepared--know what you are walking into, which is a wonderful experience you should be open to, or stay home. Also, expect street parking to be a slight challenge and plan accordingly so you can be seated by the first course. While the food was good, I am not convinced of the price point compared to some area pre-theatre menus, but you should try it for a unique experience and professional service.
68|the-capital-grille-washington|Capital Grille is one of DCs finest steak houses, with an old school atmosphere popular with lobbyists, senators, and lawyers alike. The filet mignon is cooked to perfection and is more than enough to satisfy even the hardiest appetite after a long day of work. For the best value on the wine list, ask fthe friendly and knowledeable waitstaff for the Lebanese red. Thats right. I said wine from Lebanon. Its excellent., Step into the DC political scene. Politicians, lobbyists, political writers, media consultants.....old school atmosphere is definetly the primary crowd in this joint. Lots of smoking, beer, wine, dudes in suits with red ties and silver white hair are flowing freely in this place. Amount of females in this joint is slim but those that are there are typically career driven or cougars (at least on the nite I was there). Cool thing about DC is that everyone is pretty open to chatting...about any topic and drinks make that happen even more. This is a DC local classic - for a taste of our capital at its core head over here during the week for a drink or dinner., Chain-haters will definitely take exception to Capital Grille, where the steaks are so tender they can be cut with a fork. This is the perfect place to suggest for a special occasion, or if your company is looking for a place to give a group dinner. Any way you can get here -- do it! The portions are pretty big, compared to other fancy places known for skimping. This place is better than The Palm, even though that place is also awesome. The service is also very good, as other people have mentioned. Even though the atmosphere is a little stuffy, I dont care because everything else is so perfect! This place is also a well-known stomping ground of politicians and wanna-bes alike., I cant stand this place. Id give the food a four, but knock it down to two as Id rate the rest of my experience somewhere between zero and 1.If youre a loud, obnoxious blowhard, then strap on your suspenders, grab a cigar and hurry up; your partys already at the bar.Otherwise, skip the bar and hope its not too long of a wait for your table, since youll wait for your wine. And your appetizers. And your meal. I went with a group of about ten and we finally saw the entree menu two hours after we sat down. I understand that if youre going to charge these kinds of prices, you need to make a huge production out of everything, but really. Like I said, the food was really good. I did honestly enjoy it. But Ive had equally if not better food for much less time, money and hassle. Perhaps my bad experience here was an aberration. Maybe its normally much better. I wont be back to find out., Well, I like this place!Even I cant stand the smokes from those cigar most of the time, but the food is good!And I had a great experience whenever I came to have dinner at this place.. I never really have to wait to long for the table.I guess I happen to be lucky everytime I went there.I prepare my self to go there though.. I know people can be loud and obnoxious in this place, so if I come here is the time when I hang out with a bunch of friend for a happy time!Who cares with those people, because we also having a good time!Thats why always good to come with a big group, so you dont feel left behind in this place!, Our waiter Preston, Stoli Dolis, a tender and tasty medium rare delmonico steak with balsamic and fig reduction, the coconut cream pie... this place made me like D.C. more. Much more. Even though its a chain., After a long day of meetings and crotch-grabbing, debriefing at Capital Grille is perhaps the closest I come to abandoning decades of vegetarianism. The service, menu and energy are top shelf, and its all I can do to resist a bite out of a raw slab of steak to take the bleed off. Certainly its a place for power brokers, but dont work too hard at the snobby route here: the truffle fries will make a believer out of many. Just order a martini, hoist your leg up a bit on the chair across from you, dangle a cigar from your lips - and enjoy, Even though we usually try to avoid national chain type places, we wanted steak and this is supposed to be one of the best places in DC to get one. This outlet in Penn Quarter indeed makes a good steak. We started with steak tartare and the 1/2 doz. oysters on the half shell. Both very good. Next we moved onto the kona coffee rubbed strip steak and the pepper steak with cognac cream sauce. For sides we ordered the cottage fries, the onion rings and the creamed spinach. The sides and entrees were excellent and we had enough leftovers for steak sandwiches, fried potatoes and creamed spinach the next day. The service is excellent and the atmosphere typical of an upscale steak house., If I was leaving DC forever, to never come back again, and were to eat at one last restaurant - Capital Grille would be it. What not to love? Ok, maybe the cost - but it worth every penny.Il start with the atmosphere - deep arm chairs, comfortably dim lighting, dark wood and service that is refined without the snobby attitude.If money is no object, this is my perfect menu at Cap Grille - start with a stoli doli - seriously, you can eat at the Grille without trying this drink. Follow up with a fresh seafood appetizer, including raw oysters and shrimp. If youe lucky, lobster bisque will be on the menu that day. It is hands down the best lobster bisque Ie ever had. Next, order a steak. It doesn really matter which one, they do them all well, bu the coffee rubbed strip steak is my favorite. Their sides aren anything to particularly write home about - but they do decent fries. Finally, end your meal with coconut pie. If you don like coconut, or theye sold out of the pie (which they regularly do), enjoy a creme brulee, it also amazing. Enjoy your dessert with a cappuccino. They do espresso drinks well. Oh, and I forgot to mention that you should ask the sommelier for a wine recommendation. Food this good should be enjoyed with good wine.Bon Appetit, and prepare to fork over the credit card!, So this is the place to be in DC for carnivores, as I was told by a good friend of mine. Rendezvous set for drinks and snacks at the bar. The bartender was friendly and seemed to know almost everyone by name; tres classy! You can always feel the touch of a true professional who enjoys what he does. They go out of their way to make you feel special. The place is decked out in dark mahogany wood, and plush leather booths. This place exudes all of the characteristics of a private club but its open for all; at a price of course!After hanging out here several times for drinks after work we decided to make reservations for dinner.Like I mentioned before, service and staff are amazing. Efficient without being obtrusive or cloy. We started off with the pan fried calamari which was delicious. The wine menu is by far one of the largest wine menus Ive ever seen. Just staring at it was fun. We finally decided on the Grgich Cab which was excellent. Believe or not, one of our dining companions was a vegetarian (oh boy!) but she wasnt a meat hater just a personal lifestyle choice. So she was totally fine sitting across from my huge hunk of seared juicy raw meat! She had a feast on all of the sides we ordered: decadent Lobster Mac n Cheese, Potatoes Au Gratin (waitress recommended), Fresh Creamed Spinach, and Roasted Seasonal Mushrooms.Now for the star of the party, I had a Porcini Rubbed Delmonico steak, with 8 year Aged Balsamic. Amazing! So much flavor, and tender, cooked perfectly medium rare. I was in carne heaven!!!As if that wasnt enough, we finished off with Chocolate Hazelnut Cake which I still dream about. Thick hazelnut chocolate ganache, with moist dark cake, layered with dark chocolate mousse. Sublime., The best steak house in DC hands down (and Ive tried them all). While you can get a good piece of meat in most of the major steak houses in dc, the CG truly has the equation down. Great service but not stuffy, great steaks, and the atmosphere really nails the perfect steak enviroment., Saturday was a slow night at The Capital Grillke- to our benefit. We sat at the bar which is our favorite table at many restaurants. Both the manager - Kenneth - and the managing partner - Adam - were great to talk to. They even took us on a tour of the wine cellar.We like to find new wines and given our extensive wine collections, are always looking for something that we have not tried. Kenneth suggested the 2004 Long Shadows Feather which is a Washington cab blend. It was enjoyable but not differentiated. We started with the crab and lobster cake - wow! The chuncks of lobster were amazing and there was no breading in the cakes. At $17, we labeled this as a best value. We then had the kobe beef carpaccio. It was very good although there was a bit too much arugala to balance the beef.We then split a wedge (always good) and we split a 14 ounce filet minion. Very good overall. This was my first visit to the DC Capital Grill. During the week, I sure it is a seen and be seen venue. We did see a guy that leads a large fireman union - not impressive to us but it was fun to watch him wield his powers of flirtation and political clout., Good service, great drinks, and phenomenal steaks. What more can a girl ask for? I came here after watching a game at the Verizon center, completely dressed down, and in the midst of super Tuesday to boot. Although the crowd was decked out in their work suits, I did not feel uncomfortable in the least. Although it was pretty crowded when we got there, it was not difficult to find 2 seats at the bar, with a perfect view of the tv. The bartender, Tom, was incredibly friendly but not in an overbearing kind of way. Immediately I ordered their pineapple vodka martini which was absolutely delicious. Even though I only had one, I could imagine them becoming pretty dangerous.Eventually my date and I became rather hungry and luckily for us, Capital Grille was still serving steaks at 10:30pm! As a girl who can never turn down a nice rare steak I ordered the sliced filet with wild mushrooms. About 20 minutes later I was greeted with a salt crusted hunk of red meat, perfectly seared on the outside and tender upon being sliced. My counterpart ordered the shrimp cocktail and although he was busy eying my steak with envy, seemed pretty content with his jumbo tiger prawns served on ice.By 11pm, after gorging myself on the steak, mushrooms, and my nice pineapple vodka on the rocks, I was a very happy camper and blissfully floated with my date in tow back to the car., 2/24/08 was my 3rd time to the Grille, not my best experience but they rebounded well. When there are problems at a restaurant this is really the chance to shine. Our party of 5 had one grossly undercooked steak, followed by cold coffee... the rebound did not happen then but later by management. The management was very attentive and personal when they found out. They even sent an apology letter later. This is truly a well run place.As for recommendations... the steaks are all good, although the Kona is not to tastes. I suggest the Delmonico. They have a great wine selection, desserts, appertizers, etc. Be ready to spend., I always sit at the bar when I go to Cap Grille (I guess I usally sit at the bar at every restaurant. Hmmm.....); last night was no exception. Mark, Patrick, and Tom are fantastic and always make one feel as though s/he is the most important person at the bar (which is saying a lot since there are usually some truly important people in the joint). What was different about last night is that I actually ate instead of just drinking myself silly with those Stoli Dolis. OMG--the lobster & crab cakes are amazing--huge CHUNKS of lobster.The coolest part about last night is that I met Joey Pantoliano (Joey Pants)! He shook my hand and introduced himself! I know it is ridiculous for me to get all excited about meeting an actor, but whatever... ;), We had dinner here for our business trip. The steak here is delicious! NY steak med. rare was made to perfection. Of course I had to wash that down with a bottle of cab. Overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere. Even though I did not have a suit on. Would definitely go back next time I am in town., My favorite place to get a steak. Excellent appetizers - Oysters on the Half Shell, Lobster bisque. Wait staff always friendly. Make a reservation and request a table in the back or near a wall. Tables in center can feel stuffy and not very private., I am a huge Filet Mignon fan. I am always searching for the best. Capital Grille is at the top! The service was great (ask for Mark). Very romantic and just a block from the whitehouse. Their wine list in extensive. Price-wise it is your typical expensive restaurant. My filet was $37 and wine goes from about $6 a glass to thousands for a bottle. It is al-la-carte so expect to pay and extra $10 or so on a side. Sides can serve two easily!, Favorite. Favorite. Favorite place. Im lucky enough to have a job that allows me to wine and dine from time to time. When I do, Cap Grille is one of my top choices and one of my consistent choices. Hell, its home to my favorite meal of all time (Fried Calamari for an appetizer, Seared Tuna for an entree and Creme Brulee with extra strawberries for dessert). Ive never ever had a bad meal ... never had bad service. Never had any issues of any sort. Ive had steaks and Ive always been impressed. Ive had fish and Ive never had a bad experience. Everything on this menu and their wine list makes me a very happy camper. Extra Notes:***Get a stoli doli if you like pineapples. Its their signature drink and its oh so yummy!*** Truffle Fries are a must have., Perfectly cooked filet, delicious sides (mashed potatoes and asparagus were wonderful), great extensive wine list. Service was impeccable. I also love this place because I once saw Carl Levin here, which just confirmed for me that this is the type of restaurant where you may just see one of your favorite members of Congress. Great spot., Hmmm. Not quite sure what to say about this place.My husband and I went here for lunch for restaurant week. We figured, hell, we can save money and try the place out without paying $50 for an entree, right?I always have mixed feelings about restaurant week service and quality, though. I feel like you are never treated right because youre spending so much less than a waiter would usually be tipped for.In order to compensate for this, only I ordered from the RW menu. My husband ordered from the regular lunch menu. I had a dry aged steak salad, which was underwhelming. The meat was kind of tough considering it was so pink (I asked for medium rare). I also asked for a different dressing than the Gorgonzola, but I SWEAR there was a Gorgonzola taste on my salad anyway.The waitress was also a bit gruff and the clam chowder was also average. So why three stars? Well, my husband definitely gobbled up his steak and creamed spinach and really liked the cappachio, too.The dessert that came with my RW order, the flourless chocolate cake, was GREAT. Loved it!, The lamb chops medium rare = perfection. I have no idea what my friends steaks tasted like because I wasnt willing to reciprocate. I really liked our waiter, Clifford, who was not wishy-washy at ALL about telling us what was good on the menu, and not biased by price, either.But, then again, as if I need to say it -- kiss your paycheck goodbye in this place. For 4 people getting 1 appetizer to split, a cheap bottle of wine, only 2 sides, and no dessert -- $350, not including tip. OUCH. That last star up there is being held by Ruths Chris or any other steakhouse where you can escape for less than $80 a person and at least get 3 courses., The bf and I stumbled in here on a Saturday afternoon after we couldnt go to Ceiba or Central for lunch (they dont open until late on the weekends!). WHat a great surprise! They offered the restaurant week menu for lunch which had some great selections. I went with the salad, halibut and butternut squash risotto, and a coconut creme tart. Everything was tasty!! and all for $20! The atmosphere was great; dark wood and leather and cured meats in the windows, wine lockers and a geat bathroom!! Our bartender Moira was helpful, friendly, and attentive. This is definitely a place i would go back to. This would be a grea place to entertain people from out of town., 2009 RW Review:One of the best DC lunch RW meal Ive had. Im seriously debating over the 5th star still.I only have 2 relatively small complaints. The clam chowder was on the luke warm side (but very tasty) and flourless chocolate espresso cake wasnt as good as hoped. The ham and bean soup, fish and risotto entree, sirloin steak roquefort salad and coconut cream pie were all either very good or excellent. The salad cut of the sirloin was quality cut of meat, cooked to order and quite big. Server recommendations did not disappoint for both the appetizers and entrees in the RW menu. Not surprisingly it was very hectic in the restaurant but our server handled the situation very well given the circumstance (Saturday lunch time). I would seriously consider dining here for a special occasion type meal here now. Then again if it costs 100+ per person it better be better than my experience for RW., TOTAL LET DOWN. Food and service are generic. I felt like I was in an upscale version of sizzler. Food was overcooked, bread stale, staff didnt know the menu well. Overall lame experience, Best Steakhouse in DC. Charlie Palmer has a more modern decor, and a better selection of American wine. The Capital Grille has the old town feel to it, the service is on par, and the food has been better for me. Youe going to pay dearly for it, but youe going to love the food.Were I going a little outside of DC, try Ray the Steaks., Wow. Hands down The Best Steakhouse in DC. Everything about this restaurant was brilliant. The steaks were incredible, perfect, the oysters were fantastic, and their wine list is impeccable. The service was friendly and prompt. And the restaurant itself is so pretty, from the lamp lit view of the Capitol to the wood bar and interesting wine boxes. From start to finish this was a perfect meal, not an improvement to be made., Three days later, I am still dreaming of the burger I had here-- a mix of chopped sirloin, bacon, and onion on a sturdy bun, accompanied by remarkably good french fries, strong mustard, and other tasty sauces. Im not sure what Ill have to eat to get this out of my mind.Of course they have serious steaks, too, but I was just here for lunch., Definitely the best steak Ive ever had in DC. Also probably the best calamari as well! The service is always great, the scene is fantastic, and the food choices are diverse and delicious. Ive always had a great trip to Capital Grille in DC. Updated 5 years later: still five stars. We always call Tom, our favorite waiter, and every experience is delicious. Love the lobster mac and cheese, and while I try to avoid sugar generally I always have the cheesecake br3bl39e for desert. Amazing. I have been to other Cap Grilles in other parts such as Tysons (3 stars), Mexico City (4 stars), and Seattle (3 stars). DC Cap is stil my favorite. Its also still my favorite steak in the DC area and that includes having been to Rays many times as well., The food was good. The Prices were high... But I wasnt impressed. Maybe I made the mistake of ordering the filet oscar instead of just the filet. The Caesar Salad was pretty decent and I loved the whole vibe of the resturant. However this isnt DCs best Steakhouse. Id probably try to get into Rays, The Prime Rib, or Mortons if I had the chance., Who would pay $20 for a cheeseburger and fries with an iced tea? If it at Capital Grille... ME! ME! ME!I was down on the mall Saturday morning and was in a mood for a burger. Following a few searches on my iPod touch at a popular coffee place. I read a few reviews of the Grille on Yelp. I figured I give it a try. WOW! The burger was ginormous! The patties themselves have ground sirloin, smoked bacon AND onions already inside. Honestly, the taste was so good, it didn need any condiments. (I just used the tomato, onion, pickle and lettuce to make a small salad.) I ordered it medium. It came out pink and warm in the center. TIP: Once you get the burger, let it rest for a few minutes to let the juices re-distribute.Then I tasted the fries. They too need no condiments. They come with light parmesan cheese and truffle oil! Purists will find them a bit greasy at 1st, but hey that the truffle OIL! So tasty! TIP: Eat them while theye warm. They get a little droopy when cold.The iced tea wasn bad either and the bartender was very sweet.Now, I not a small person, but I could easily have split that meal with a friend and we probably still couldn finish it.Pricy but worth it. Not an everyday hangout, but a couple of times a month won hurt!, Disclaimer: Yes, I was a tourist. With a large group of people with a VERY large expense account (the kind with no accountability).This was one of the finest dining experiences of my life. Everything was perfect. I would pay ridiculous amounts of money to have the calamari flown out to me. It was the highlight of my week in DC. I will absolutely go again when I get back to visit- even without the expense account., This place is a DC standard - and rightfully so. When I asked where to have a steak in DC, I got two answers - one led me astray, one led me to ...*shake voice a bit* the promised land. Theyve got the meat, and it is good-um. Theyve got the calamari, and it is good-um. Good lawd they even got the potatoe and its even betta-um!Although, I have no idea how it used to be, so I have no starting point :) But from my experience, it was just as its reputation stated. If youre in DC, you at least have to give them a shot. :), This is where excellent food meets excellent service. I always order my favorites, tuna steak (raw) and a side of mushrooms (thats sort of as big as a meal). I better stop writing because Im starting to salivate., Capital Grill definitely ranks among the best steakhouses. The calamari is absolutely phenomenal. The service is great. I would definetly recommend this place., Steak! Wonderful. Good Bar too., Can you say Stoli Doli? I much prefer the feel of this steak house to perhaps a Mortons or Ruth Chris - it just feels swankier. I prefer to sit in the bar area where you can still get good service(I would argue better and more personable) and still get a great meal. The calimaris a must as a starter and my choice of steak depends on how indulgent Im feeling. And no experince is complete without at least one(maybe three) Stoli Dolis., mano man... this place rocks. great chow & setting--service left a little to be desired--server kept forgetting our small 2ppl party, in favor of larger parties. service wasnt bad ... just not up to usual par of places of this caliber. eating is about the food anyhow, not how often or quickly your water glass is filled.had the mushrooms as an appetizer--very good. bread/butter delicious with the salad--some of the best blue chees dressing ive ever had. entree: surf/turf--lobster tail was pretty small, but really good. steak was awesome--got it with maytag blue cheese--great. cannot beat steak/lobster combo.high point of the meal, had to be the side ordered, macaroni, cheese & lobster. combination you might never think of--but a real natural--they gave enough for two--but I ate most of it myself. not enough room for dessert, but they had some good ones--next time!will i go back? roger that--everytime im in DC if i can make it. wish they had one of these places in long beach, where im stationed., i went here during restaurant week for the $20 3-course meal. i got the hangar steak and my wife had the filet mignon. i was hoping to try their dry-aged meat but it wasn on the restaurant week menu. ie definitely had better steak - i say avoid the filet as it was rather flavorless. the hangar steak was good, but i wouldn say it was great. my salad was called a field greens salad but was made with romaine leaves and was absolutely soaked in vinagrette. the flourless chocolate coffee cake was delicious.i be a lot more disappointed if i had spent full price., This would never be a place Id choose to eat, but only because Im a poor student living in DC. This is a very swanky, very Mortons Steakhouse-like restaurant just down the street from the Capitol, so I was pleasantly surprised when my boss took me here. I had the salmon salad ($16), which was delicious, mainly because there were little, crunchy balls of wasabi in the salad. I will probably never go back here again, but Id recommend it if youve got the means., Took the big boss out for a special night. The service was absolutely excellent from the hostess to the bar staff to our waitress who insisted on buying us her favorite dessert while we hemmed and hawed at the dessert menu. Jocelyn was her name. Lovely large goblets of Chianti at the bar followed by delicious fried calamari and cherry peppers. He had a big steak that looked good and I had the lamb chops. Perfectly cooked and plenty of them at 4 double cut pieces. We shared the asparagus with hollandaise that was way to thin. All in all it was OK, even good but for $250 for 2?? I wanted to be wowed. I wont be back except for maybe the calamari and a few glasses of red at the bar but for steaks, for a serious attention to side orders....Im going back to RAYS., Always nice to eat at any capital grill.. A very manly atmosphere but hey who enjoy steaks more than them eh? The lobster mac& cheese is a winner!, Ive been here a few times before, but this particular outing reaffirmed my reasonings for consciously eating what fiscally amounts to a winter electric bill. October 17, 2009:The fare (while waiting at the bar): one glass of wine, one stoli elite and cranberry, an order of the calamari, and an order of the oysters.Now, while the libations are pretty hard to sour, there was nothing impressive about the glass of wine I sampled, but... That wasnt the reason to be at The Capital Grille, the food was! So, the Calamari was just how calamari should be cooked and served: crispy, accompanied by sweet, tart and spicy peppers that enhance the flavour and served quite alone.. Arrogant enough to forgo the side sauces and stand on its own crispy tenacles... YUM! The fare (main dining hall): two ceasar salads with shaved parmesan, delmonico steak (medium), citrus grilled salmon, lobster macncheese, and truffle fries.Alright... The ceasar is pretty standard: romaine, house ceasar dressing, croutons, and parmesan. This parmesan was pretty good. My salad was a tad bit overdressed and my dinner date suggested I ask for it to be remade, but... For a salad? I think not! By the time the salmon and sides came, I had little room left to do anything much but sample and box, which was quite fine for the server, he was very accommodating, esp. because his table turn time would be under an hr. thanks to my huge eyes! But, I must say something about the lobster macncheese. Now, this is almost unfair because I LOVE campanelle!! I mean I love it!! This was the richest, flavourful lobster mac I could ever suggest... I was simply in heaven!!Dessert: The hazelnut chocolate cake... yum!The service from start to finish was quite good, if I had to compare I would definitely say it was a step-down from Charlie Palmers Steak House, but still quite acceptable. You can easily spend a medium price of 150 a person without blinking but the food as well as the service justify the expense., This particular review is based on my recent afternoon stop with a girl friend for drinks, and the rating would be (slightly) higher for the several meals I have eaten here. So I was at first reluctant to add this rating to the numerous raves about the food, but, after all, this is a bar too and drinks are part of what this place offers. Hence this review.To start off, the place had a rather funky smell, which at least for us is a big turn-off. As some have said, the wine list was extensive, but there is apparently no happy hour and it was difficult to find a decent wine at a reasonable price. I ordered a mediocre pinot grigio, which was served warm. My friend $5 Bud Light also was warm, although they provided a cold glass upon her request, which helped some.We hit the change in shift and the bartender asked us to settle almost immediately. The entire bill mistakenly was put on my card, without anyone asking. (We were sitting at the bar and ordering separately.) No big deal, we settled up between each other later, but this was far from the wonderful service we have heard described.We stayed a few minutes after the staff turnover, and were basically ignored while the new bartender had a long conversation with what appeared to be a manager or another member of the staff.We checked out early and went to a place more to our liking.OK, I know afternoon drinks are not a big part of their business. But when you drop $20 + in a few minutes, you should get chilled drinks and made to feel like more than a minor inconvenience., Was told this was the greatest steak you will ever had and I was a little skeptical seeing as how Ive just recently returned from South America and sampled steaks in Argentina and Uruguay (Uruguay being the best) but once I bit into the steak I thought I was in heaven. The only downside is its a little bit pricey. I have to tell you though, I ordered something that is not even on the menu., Capitol Grille has by far the BEST martini in Washington, DC! The Stoli Doli is heavenly, and their signature drink. Its simplicity is simply elegant. Pineapple-infused Stoli vodka, straight up. (This is no Moose Juice - the rip off served at Bugaboo Creek.) My fiance is not a martini fan, other than an occasional dirty martini. But he LOVED this one and ordered a couple for himself. This martini is so frothy and delicious. Truly - you will love it, especially if you are a fan of real pineapple!! In fact, the bartender gave us a free sample to try. We were hooked! I drank them throughout the meal, and maybe one too many. I have since made it point to go to the Capitol Grille in Boston more often for this signature drink. Our steaks were so fabulous!! I ordered the filet mignon. Yummy!! Yummy!! Worth every penny and then some. And the bartender and our waiter were so attentive. So attentive!! Some of the best service, ever!However, the reason I gave the Capital Grille 4 stars instead of 5 was that the sides we ordered were such a disappointment. The potatoes au gratin had no flavor - a little salt and pepper would go a long way. The creamed spinach was made using nutmeg and possibly other spices that gave it a terrible aftertaste. We barely touched either of them. So save your money on the sides and order more Stoli Dolis, instead!!, Last night the Missus and I visited the Capital Grille, in Washington D.C. as part of our ight on the town celebrating (belatedly) the Missusbirthday. We have eaten there twice before, but this time it wasn as good as we remembered.I had made the reservations a week ago making sure to let them know we were there for a birthday and that we prefer a quiet location. One out of two was the best they could do. Now, I know there isn really a perfectly quiet spot in this place, but it almost as if they chose the exact opposite location. We were sat in a small room with six tables. 4 lawyer/political/lobbyist types populated the table closest to us. They were having a good oltime whooping it up on a Friday night. Behind us was a table of four college students where one particular individual droned on and on about their trips to Rio for new years and their trips to Europe for whatever occasion. Not really their fault, but they just had a voice type that pierced all conversation in the room.Aside from the noise in the room, the table had chairs that were sized for children. They had to be the MOST uncomfortable chairs Ie been in since a visit to Golden Corral decades ago. The seats seemed just about the size of your rear end, and then had a nice front edge that dug into your legs, cutting off blood flow to your feet.In the past wee had servers that were conversational and friendly. They even gave us business cards so we could request them at another time. Alas we didn have those cards last night. The server we got had more in common with the lunch lady Doris character on The Simpson then the level of server I expect from this place. She was grumbly and mumbly and didn seem to want to be there. I chalk it up to being the end of the night and she was probably worn out after a day of work, but it was still kind of off-putting.Aside from these problems, the food was great. We started with Prosciutto with Mozzarella cheese and vine ripened tomatoes (Yummy!), then I had a wedge salad with oil & balsamic vinegar (again, Yummy!). The Missus had the fillet Oscar and Lobster mac  cheese and I had the Porterhouse for our entrees. The food, as always was spectacular! They even brought out a chocolate cake slice with a candle for the birthday.To sum up, while the food scored a big hit and particularly enjoyable, it was muted by the poor seats, seating location and service. This is why I chose 2 stars. As Yelp defines that rating Meh. Ie experienced better, so do I define our latest visit to the Capital Grille., I recently went to the Capital Grille in Washington DC for a guys lunch before a wedding, and it did not disappoint. Much like their restaurants in Boston, Chicago and Minneapolis, the Capital Grille in Washington DC is awesome. The service was top rate, the location was walking distance from the Washington Monument and the food --- well its the Capital Grille, do i need to say anything more? insider note: Capital Grilles lunch menu is a lunch menu with sandwiches and smaller portions - but all you have to do is ask for a Delmonico and they will be more than happy to set you up with a perfect steak., Very good., The first time I went to Capital Grille I was a little intimidated I must admit. I was just beginning my ventures into the world of fine dining and was still adjusting . The first thing I noticed walking into Capital Grille was the Buffalo head that seemed to be staring at me in the most eerie of ways, LOL.OK...once you make it past the Buffalo head you will notice that Capital Grille gives the appearance of an upscale restaurant. As well it should given its location. The decor is classic. Something that would suit those of an older generation. This place is known for...you guessed it, steak! So of course thats what I had to try. I made the mistake of ordering mine well done. Should have gone medium well. But in spite of that my steak was still pretty good. Service was excellent. The waiter was very outgoing and friendly., Sit at the bar. Ask for Patrick. Have a sotli doli. Order the chefs recommendation: sliced filet. You will not be disappointed!, Ive have been there 3 times in three years, the first 2 times were amazing with fabulous food and great service. The last time (12-03-09) was just a disappointment. It was my wife birthday, we had a reservation for 8:30, but didnt get seated before 9:00. The room we were in was extremely noisy and we were seating at this huge round table were you could have seated at least 6 people, not really romantic, but at least a lot of room :-). I remembered this place for its outstanding service but this time it was just ok The food was great as usual. I just hope for them that it was just one of these bad days, but I wont go there again, for the price, it was not worth it. for 1/3 of the price I would have taken my wife to Clydes and it would have been the same., i love this place! Best steak house! Better then Morton and Ruths and great place to enjoy a nice quite date. If you like loud peoples and rude service go to Morton or Ruths, this place was horrible. i expected good service since the one in boston is great. my boyfriend and i made a reservation here for 9pm and got there right on time on a tuesday night. the hostess was unfriendly and rude. she made us wait for 45 minutes, while she sat several parties with no reservations and even her friends at one point! we walked out at 9:45, disgusted with the horrible service for a supposedly elegant place, Our dining experience here was just perfect! The d39cor is classic with dark wood and animal heads on the wall, I loved it! I couldnt help but order a dirty martini at the bar while we waited for our table. It was fantastic and $14, the most expensive martini I have ever had, haha, and I drink a lot of dirty martinis!The service was impeccable from the moment we walked in. They took my coat right away and gave me a black napkin since I was wearing a black dress, I was hooked! Our server was very friendly and down to earth, which I liked, and very attentive. The food was incredible. We had the caesar salad and wedge salad to start, both were great. I had the filet and my boy friend had the porter house, which I believe is the same as New York. Both were cooked perfectly, medium rare. We also had the cream spinach. The wine list was amazing; they had some of the most amazing wines and so many vintages. The dessert was the only thing I wasnt crazy about, we got the chocolate cake, I cant remember the exact name, but it was huge, 4 people could easily share it. It was just a little too much chocolate and a little dry, but I wont hold this against them!I would definitely recommend The Capital Grill in D.C. to anyone for a special and amazing dining experience!, After eating at many high-end steakhouses -- Ruths Chris, Mortons, Smith & Wollensky, The Palm, Rays (although thats not high-end) -- Id rate Capital Grille at the top.The steak I ordered -- a Kona-crusted, dry-aged sirloin -- was Fred Flintstone big. The server set it in front of me and I had immediate fantasies of the future meals I would get out of it.This is gonna sound crazy, but I like to judge steak the next day, straight outta my fridge, in the cold, harsh light of my kitchen while Im attacking it with a dull steak knife and the carnivorous appetite of my Teutonic ancestors. One can really see the tenderness then and the flavor of the meat comes through better, in my opinion, than when its hot. (But I happen to like raw meat, which I know is not for everyone.) This steak was damn good...dare I say better than the night before in the restaurant.Their mashed potatoes are truly divine: a testament to how great only 4 ingredients can taste. Apps were fantastic (calamari, crab cakes).I went as a guest of a private party and have no idea what the bill was but suspect it was in the ballpark of some private schools tuition. Go with a good credit limit...or someone elses card., Capital Grille is yet another steakhouse in town. When you walk in, there are seaks aging in the fridge near the bar. I hung out at the bar to watch the football game. I had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc and the Four Vines red they were both delicious. The Four Vines red was bold and robust!! Super yummy. I had some oysters they were soso bluepoint oysters. The Kona-crusted steak came out more medium than medium rare so it was sent back. For a $45 steak it better be cooked to the liking of the customer. They were cool with it being sent back. I had the porcini rubbed delmonico with a 12 yr old balsamic. It was cooked to a perfect medium rare, had a nice crust and a hint of sweetness from the balsamic. The special side of the night was the cubed roasted butternut squash, it was not so lucky- it was undercooked and flavorless. What a shame., I have been back a few times in 2009, and still impressed with the consistency of Captial Grille! Pricey but well worth the special treat. If you like great food, you will love this restaurant., Do you want a good filet? This is where you want to go. Sure there are lots of steakhouses in DC/NoVA, but this is the whole package. First, ask for a booth. A table is just not the same. Cliff and Tom are the best servers in the business, and you cant go wrong with any of their suggestions. The wine they have turned us on to has been worth the trip to CG alone. Things not to miss? The Stoli Doli, the Calamari, the off menu Bone-in Filet, a side of the 12-year aged Balsamic reduction, Lobster Mac N Cheese and the Truffle Fries. Delightful. Were not big dessert people, but everything weve tried has been great.Yes, an expense account helps, but the experience itself is worth the price., I had a friend in town for the weekend and wanted to show him one of DCs finest. We were not disappointed. We both had the Filet Oscar. I got the 14 oz portion which was no mentioned on the menu but mentioned to me by the server for a price of $61. Not too many places to find a 14 ounce filet. It was great. Side items are a la carte and are decent size. The chocolate hazelnut cake is HUGE and can feed two people easily. We were there on a Saturday night and decent crowd. Alex Ovechkin was there and several Washington Wizards showed up after their game to east as well. Not that I judge a restaurant by which pro athletes go to but a place must have a good rep if these guys are going there. On top of that, I was very satisfied with my meal and will definitely return
69|the-dabney-washington|A new restaurant has been added to Blagden Alley! The Dabney is owned by Chef Jeremiah Langhorne (worked at McCradys and Husk in SC, and Noma in Denmark), where the restaurants concept is farm-to-table, focusing on Mid-Atlantic flavors. They even have a rooftop garden, where the ingredients are showcased on the menu! When you step in, it has this lovely rustic charm to it, with the wooden floors, tables, and sturdy dark chairs. The bar was cute, with large counter space at the bar - I was pretty intrigued with their drink menu, featuring Southern Style Sodas & Ciders and house beverages - I ended up trying the Dabney Bramble, which contained Fords gin, sour cherry cordial, lemon, and winter kiwi berry - this was refreshing and comes in a camper mug - the mini kiwi berries were adorable (!!!), and I loved the crushed ice within. The menu (which was not too extensive, which I loved!) offers small plates and family-style entrees where the food can be shared easily, such as Cape May Scallop Crudo, Root Vegetable Chowder, Seared Fluke, and Chicken & Dumplings are offered. The hubs and I tried the following: Crispy Vegetable Skins (pig head, greens, buttermilk dressing, toasted benne seeds, and sorrel - these were like crispy root chips with a nice little sweet glaze, with chunks of roasted pig head meat); Cape May Scallop Crudo (warm bacon and fennel vinaigrette, fish pepeprs, Asian pear, and flying dragon lemon; I wasnt really a fan of this, but the hubs thought it was light and fresh); Pork Sausage (grilled bread with onions, chilis, and herbs - this was a nice crispy rustic bread, topped with crumbled sausage; fresh and tasty); Baked Farm Egg (creamed celeriac, farro verde, kimchee (sauce), and herbs - this was a nice dish, as it was risotto-esque, topped with a runny egg); Buttermilk Biscuit (fried egg, foie gras, country ham, apples, and maple; the biscuit was yummy and tasty, and I actually liked the salty country ham slice with the biscuit more than the foie gras); Whitmore Farm Grilled Pork Belly (spicy sweet potato and radish chow-chow; two glazed pork belly strips that had a yummy candied coating - this was pretty tasty!); and, Chicken & Dumplings (Eastern Shore style, this had mounds of fresh vegetables (loved the mini carrots (!!!) and the colorful cauliflower!), wide al dente noodles, and a lovely broth - this was more of like a hearty chicken noodle soup rather than the typical chicken and dumplings; this also came with a side of herbs, pickles, radishes, raw vedge salad, and a housemade cornbread in a mini cast iron skillet (which tasted like a pancake)). To end our meal, we tried the following desserts: Apple Pie (angostura bitters ice cream and wood-grilled marshmallow - thinly-sliced apple with a nice buttery crust; loved the ice cream!); the Toasted Peanut Butter Cake (with celery ice cream and black malted barley crumble - this was a great pairing, and I loved the celery touch to the not-so-overpowering PB cake); and, the Winter Kiwi Berry Sorbet (sorbet with autumn olives (like pomegranate seeds) and puffed grain, all topped with a generous mound of house yogurt; the hubs actually had a slight allergic reaction to this, so that was a little crazy!). At the end, we received complimentary ginger molasses cookies, which were chewy and delicious! I loved how there was an open-fire hearth, where most of the ingredients are cooked in. Overall, each of the dishes were clean, well-seasoned, and delicious - I loved how it was oh-so-fresh and beautifully presented! We were even able to talk with Chef Jeremiah himself (of course, I was totally a STARSTRUCK mess), who was super sweet and friendly! :D Our server was Tim W., and he was super attentive and made sure that we had new warm plates and new silverware for each of the courses :D Everyone was just super friendly! This is a wonderful addition to the Shaw neighborhood, and my favorite farm-to-table type of restaurant Ive had so far! I cannot wait to go back to try their ever-changing menu! :D+farm to table & a seasonal menu+rooftop garden+ask for Chef Jeremiah :D+ask for Tim W. :D+no reservation options and walk-ins only (for now)+closed on Mondays+located off of 9th (through the Blagden Alley)+metered parking on 9th, This is definitely a solid restaurant and a great addition to the area. I cant wait to see how they change and what comes next.Friendly staff and you can tell everyone cares about the place.Very nice wines and drink list. Bartenders who are knowledgeable about the drinks as well as the menu. Try the riesling - not too sweet and very refreshing.Beautiful presentations of food and loved the music and atmosphere. What we had (pros/ cons):* Crispy vegetable skins - interesting and delicious. Not sure what we were going to get and was definitely pleasantly surprised. More pork than veggies it seemed like (?) so if youre looking for a veggie appetizer this probably isnt for you.* Pork Belly entree - very good. One of us thought there could be more greens but everything was SO GOOD and wouldnt really change a thing.* Root vegetable and oyster chowder - sadly not good and would not order again. It came lukewarm to start. There were uncooked large chunks of carrots and celery which added a crunch but WAY too much so. There were also large oysters in the chowder which you would think would be awesome. However, if you got a bite of a large raw carrot and an oyster it just didnt work to have to bite through everything and chew the oyster so much with the other veggie pieces. The menu also listed brioche but I didnt see that anywhere. Maybe it was supposed to come on the side and didnt make its way from the kitchen?* Celery ice cream - FANTASTIC. I hope they keep this ice cream. Its so good I would seriously buy a pint if that was an option. * Apple Pie - nope. a miss. Really tough crust. You shouldnt need a knife to cut through a pie crust. The toasted marshmallow on top didnt add much and apples need more flavor. Arrived lukewarm. Interesting combo with the bitters ice cream though.All in all I will definitely be back. They have a frequently changing menu which is fun as long as all the kinks can be worked out of the menu items before they make it onto the plates., Service was great and the food was fantastic. Everything was very flavorful and let the ingredients shine. Portions are fairly small, so dont expect to go home with leftovers. Really enjoyed the overall ambiance and decor.What we ordered:Crispy Vegetable SkinsButtermilk BiscuitWhitmore Farms Grilled Pork BellyApple Pie, New hot spot in blagden alley. Kinda helps complete the entire alley though with rogue and the coffee shop. The entrance is all windowed doors to see inside of the open kitchen concept dining area. Most staff is dressed really casual and the large fire is centered in the kitchen which brings for good ambience.Wait staff is friendly and inviting, willing to explain and introduce anything new on the menu and of course the items themselves. Cocktails are pretty interesting but I have to admit everything has some bitters in it and it can be a bit sweet.Everything on the menu has some form of pork in the dish. Its actually up to par with the pork as the pig is. If pork isnt your thing. May not be your best choice. However, chef is more than willing to remove the pork if possible. I highly do NOT recommend this place for vegetarians because theres isnt much variety for you and all the changes one would request would just be annoying to everyone. Unless youre into the liquid diet.We started with the scallops. Pretty tasty, cooked just right, I dont eat pork so they just put the bacon dressing on the side. My eating partner was very satisfied with the dressing. The vegetable chowder was delicious. def a well executed cream soup with vegetables that seemed to be prepared with the right amount of char. I could def take some more now.The swordfish was the winner. Cooked medium, just enough salt and flavor and the pumpkin creme was fairly light so it went well with the fish. Prob best swordfish Ive had.My only complaint was there was a long stretch of time between our first dish and the rest. Prob a good 40 mins. And we were starving. Its the first week theyre open so I get that it takes time to iron out the quirks.Would I recommend this to a friend? Yes. Would I go back? Sure. I overall had a B experience.We then ordered, Came here opening night. Great atmosphere, beautiful space, phenomenal drinks. The food was very very good but didnt blow my mind. Prices were fair and I left quite satisfied (though I didnt love my apple pie dessert). Also, Im not a vegetarian but was surprised to see the very limited number of vegetarian options on the menu given the publicized importance the chef places on vegetables. Ill definitely be back often and am excited to see how it develops.Get the Halfway to Concord cocktail, An inviting fire, intriguing flavors, and excellent staff. It actually lived up to the months of hype! Well be back soon to see whats new on the ever-changing menu!, When we turned down the alleyway I really wasnt sure what to expect. Then, like a shimmering oasis in the desert, there was the Dabney. The restaurant is gorgeous. The service was impeccable. The menu is short, inventive, and simple. Everything was wonderful. I cannot wait to go back! One of the best meals Ive had in a very long time., This place looks really amazing! But unfortunately the people who work here are completely unaware of anything that is going on. Ask the woman at the front door how long the wait is and its 10 min. Ask someone else and your wait is 2 hours. No cohesiveness throughout. Not really sure what is going on but hopefully with time management will improve!, Food was incredible, service impeccable, and the atmosphere and decor were excellent as well. Despite walking in with out a reservation we were able to get a table immediately, though we were there very early in the evening. The kitchen is open and in the middle of the restaurant, adding some flames and craft work to the ambiance, but also manages not be a distraction with a very cozy vibe overall. Party of 3 and we ate and shared most of the menu none of which disappointed. Apparently the menu changes daily, so I not sure how informative this is, but most of the larger dishes our night were fish, though we also got the grilled pork belly which was excellent if a tad small. The fried porgy was probably some of the best fish Ie had in DC and the grits and brassica were the two favorites for sides. I also had the Halfway to Concord, a Manhattan-like drink, that was superb. My only reservation is that the structure of the menu and the $$ rating on yelp are a bit misleading in that its hard to determine roughly how much to you need to order and spend. The yelp rating is of course not their fault, though it should certainly be corrected (for comparison, Boundary Stone has the same rating and is probably half the cost, though of course no where near the quality). The menus I saw online had plates for ~$25, which, given the $$ rating, I would have assumed was an entree, but they are not. It not quite a small plates place, but similar in you really need to order and share multiple things. Think more ~$45/person for food. This is of course fine, and the food is worth top dollar, but I prefer to have a better sense in advance. That said, it probably the best restaurant Ie been to in a long, long time., In my 37 years of being a vegetarian, I can recall ever having dined somewhere quite as hostile as The Dabney. In Washington, D.C. in the twenty-first century, even most steakhouses can make vegetarian entrees, at least on request. Not so at The Dabney. Despite my friend calling ahead and being assured they could accommodate me, I left my $75 meal hungry. The only vegetarian items on the menu were two appetizer salads. Michael, our rather surly waiter, seemed bothered when I asked if the chef could prepare something else for me. He reluctantly agreed to inquire and returned to say essentially no. They could omit bacon from an appetizer soup, but that was really it. The proprietors must have consciously decided to be rude to vegetarians, which is both shocking and sad.My three non-vegetarian friends didn enjoy their meals either. Our server Michael condescended to us throughout the meal, beginning when we asked him for drink recommendations. The service was slow, and our dishes arrived sporadically I finished both of mine before two of my friends were served anything at all. After waiting an hour with no food, one friend asked for some bread, and Michael said they didn have any. Several minutes later, he did come through with some toasted Wonder bread, but it was too little too late. Even the desserts disappointed. Celery ice cream sure is novel, but tastes about as good as it sounds. I would give this place zero stars if Yelp allowed., We moved here from NYC a little over a year ago and were disappointed in the DC food scene but this place has put the biggest smile on our face! The atmosphere is lively but not overcrowded and cozy. The cocktails are amazing. Whether it is a larger size dish or a side dish they put thought into each one and nailed it. We couldnt pick a favorite. We will be back here for sure and will be recommending this place to all our friends., Really enjoyed The Dabney. We had the table immediately across from the fire pit-stove, so that was a bonus. Server was very nice. Space was comfortable. Good atmosphere. Things we ate:1. Grilled flowering brassicas. Very good. A pretty unique salad. Waitress described like Brussel spouts, but wed compare more to kale. The potato pure was nice. My co-eater thought the dressing was a bit salty, but it was still her favorite dish. 2. Sunburst farms trout. This was my favorite. The fish was good. The black eyed peas, as promised, were awesome. The fried pork rinds were an unusual accompaniment, but it all worked. 3. Buttermilk biscuit. We regretted this order. Should have gotten scallops. It wasnt bad. But our guilt over ordering an $18 egg sandwich was well founded. Maybe if it had really great foie gras -- but it was actually pretty flavorless. More like scrapple. The country ham was good-- but more like a tiny piece of bacon. It wasnt bad, but -we would have better off getting two desserts for the same money (which we did anyway). 4. Whistle pig hollow grilled pork. I really liked this. Co-eater thought the meat was too dry and the sauce was too sweet. I thought it was better than that. We both agreed this item would have been outstanding at a Chinese restaurant, but we expected more from the anchor item on the Dabneys menu5. Apple pie crumble. Pretty good. The angostura bitters ice cream was neat, but there was barely two bites worth. A Better ice cream to crumble ratio would have saved this. Not bad, but not great. 6. Toasted peanut butter cake with celery ice cream. AWESOME. The cake was really good. The ice cream was great. Need to taste each piece on their own to appreciate. Really liked the sprigs of celery sprinkled on top. My favorite dish. 7. Gentlemans bet. A good take on an old fashioned. Thicker than usual because they used jam instead of whole fruit for the sweetness. The sugared rim was an unusual touch. Very good drink. Things we liked:- Dining room space. Feels like blue duck but more comfortable. - complimentary sparkling water. Bravo. Every restaurant should get on this. - open fire- friendly, on top of their game wait staffThings we didnt like so much:- what is it with restaurants not serving bread? So much sauce is going to waste. And besides the sauce, when you go out for a fancy dinner.. You expect some bread. Waitress said they dont have capacity yet but are working on it. - we like when restaurants bring out food as dishes are ready, but more effort to prevent stacking would be helpful. We had barely started out first when the second came out. Out first big plate came out before the second small plate. Not so bad, but annoying. It so happens co-eater and I share everything, so it didnt matter what came out when -- but at the table next to us they each had their own food.. And it always seemed like only one was ever eating at a time. We were stressed out on their behalf. We wouldnt come back with a group. - no bike parking. Id call this the most hipster little development in DC. How can there be no bike parking? We had to lock precariously to a chain link fence. - whats with the $90 rib eye? It just makes the rest of the menu feel like youre cheaping out (which youre not). This restaurant is not a steakhouse, and I think it adds a weird snooty element to include this. UNLESS it was actually a complete meal for two (I.e comes with and appetizer or some vegetables, and dessert), not just a splurge entree item. Bottom line: you should eat here. Fun dining experience., at the end of the dinner we contemplated for a while when we had a dinner this good in DC. to be honest i still cant recall. so lets get the obvious out of the way ... great location, beautifully done space, friendly and helpful service ... one couldnt ask for more. but the food was outstanding. as starters we had the fall salad and the vegetable chowder which both were amazing. the salad especially was crisp with the perfect amount of dressing and a complete surprise. in-between courses we had corn bread ... good god, just order it, dont even ask why, its amazing. my favorite was the crust. and then for mains we had the duck and the chicken dishes. the duck just fell off the bones but i would say it were the sides the peas and the tomato sauce that were the stars of that dish. for the chicken it was just the tenderness and moistness of the chicken that stood out. and then there was the apple crumble at the end well it came with a grilled marshmallow ... do i need to say more? can only highly recommend this place., Bottom line: it was a very nice meal, in a very nice setting, but it wasnt worth the high price.The restaurant is, first of all, gorgeous. Warm and cozy, open kitchen, tucked away down Blagden Alley so it feels almost like a secret. Service was very good as well. We also got lucky: we put our name in for a table, they said it would be 45 minutes, and as we stood outside contemplating where wed wait (the bar was too packed for us to bother), they called us in. So about 5 minutes later, for a table that I noticed was open when we put our name in. Obviously, a new restaurants working-out-the-kinks sort of thing, but glad it worked in our favor.The menu was not very extensive (I think it changes daily, at least somewhat) and not a lot jumped out at me, but me and my dining companion wound up splitting the rib eye for two, and also started with the corn bread small plate.The corn bread was good. It came out in a small pan--the waitress warned us that the pan was hot, but she didnt also warn us that the bread itself was literally lava. Once it cooled, it was tasty. But... it came such a miniscule dollop of butter on top of the bread (which was quickly melting because of the aforementioned lava-like heat) that most of the bread had to be eaten dry, which was unfortunate. And about 1/3 of the bread of it was ever-so-slightly burned, but not enough to send back or not eat. It was good but--and this will be a common refrain for the rest of this review--it was $8 for something that would be free in most other restaurants, and it was rather small--split two ways, each of our share was equivalent to a small single piece of cornbread, with minimal butter.The rib-eye was very good--its what youd expect for a rib-eye; it wasnt anything earth-shattering, but they did a nice job and it was delicious. The jus was great--although the kimchi ketchup was mixed into it, and for some reason, that taste only came through maybe every fifth bite. The grits that came on the side were absolutely phenomenal.We also each ordered a cocktail. Mine was some sort of peach gin thing, which was very cool and tasty. I forgot what my friend ordered, but he also gave solid reviews.They also gave us ginger cookies at the end with our check. Those were good too, and I love the little bit of extra pampering when they give you a taste of dessert. Thats a nice touch.Final price, per person including tip, was about $80. Which, honestly, was overpriced for what we received. I dont mind splurging for a great meal, but thats a little obscene for a piece of bread, an entree, and one cocktail, all of it very good but not mind-blowing. I enjoyed the meal, dont get me wrong, but I feel like theres better restaurants in the city for this price (will this review get censored if I shout out to the far superior Roses Luxury?) and equally good restaurants all down 14th Street for about 2/3 of the price.So... I dont know. I wouldnt call it a forgettable meal, but I wouldnt call it an especially memorable one. Honestly, if Im going to order a $45 entree (half of the $90 rib eye), I really expect to be gushing about this meal for weeks, and I wont be. But I give this review with the caveat that, had this been a $55 meal instead of an $80 one, my review would have been more positive., **** 3.5 stars ****Our dinner with friends at The Dabney was very good, to be sure, and the drinks might have even outshone the food if I being honest. There are still some service complexities here that need to be corrected though, and theye not just minor quibbles. This was easily one of the most anticipated openings of the year in DC, and after hearing effusive praise my expectations were at an all-time high. The one area where The Dabney really shines more than anything is the decor, particularly the bar and the open kitchen with its roaring hearth. This place certainly feels homey, although that somewhat lost with the unnecessarily loud music that shifts from mellow to something near death metal at times. This was one of the oddest playlists Ie ever been subjected to in a restaurant, and really squandered an otherwise nice setting (and I typically don even notice background music unless it happens to be particularly good, in places like Black Jack, Toki, etc). The chairs are really comfortable, and the tables plenty big for lots of plates.Before we had even ordered we had already interacted with seemingly half a dozen waitstaff members, doing various tasks to get us situated. I found this to be overkill to some degree, and it complicated things when trying to flag down someone for assistance during the course of the meal. I sure all of them are totally necessary for some reason, I just couldn figure out what it was. Efficiency to the point of being inefficient. The one who I believe to be our actual waiter informed us that the kitchen just sort of sends things out whenever they are ready. Ie heard this spiel over and over at most small plates style restaurants, but never at a place that seems to be more course-driven like The Dabney. There are obvious, lighter, starter style dishes and heavier proteins, even though theye all just lumped together on the menu. I have a feeling that if you were just dining with yourself and a date that you would never even encounter the issue that we had here, but fair warning if you come with more than that expect some awkwardness.Our dining companions ordered 3 of the lighter dishes (salad, brassicas, foie biscuit) plus some a side, and we ordered 1 lighter dish (egg), 2 heavier dishes (flounder, pork), and some sides as well. Then the oddest service Ie possibly ever received from a kitchen ensued. Their side of Brussels was brought out before anything else (what the point in calling it a side dish if it not served alongside something?), then they received all three of their courses before we had even received our first. If youe going around the table obviously taking orders from individual people, shouldn you prioritize firing items so that each person has something to eat? Maybe I don want to share my friend stalks of bok choy, is that too much to ask? It should be some indication of the level of food here that my review of this place isn slammed significantly lower, because I can tell you I was seriously annoyed. The wait time after our friends FINISHED eating before we were actually served food was somewhere between 15 to 20 minutes. I can imagine how long it would have been had we ordered the $90 ribeye for two. (more than 300% the price of any other item on the menu, and the waiter didn even bother to offer an explanation of why it was so special or what it was beyond the menu description)You can look through the photos to see what was ordered, the menu changes almost weekly if not sooner so there no point in dwelling on specific dishes. We found the food to be very solid in flavors, but nothing revolutionary. It was more classy takes on feel good flavors. I was disappointed in the bite of biscuit that I had, especially coming from a chef with a Southern pedigree, but both of our main proteins were cooked excellently. We all found dessert to be somewhat of a flop. The flavor pairings for each item were just too odd and seemed to be trying to hard to be avant-garde.This place has some serious potential, but they need to get their act together. Luckily there not too much pretension going on here, so it seems like the place that might actually listen to criticism and put it to good use. For now, if I return Il be sticking to the outstanding cocktails at the bar and trying some more of their exemplary cider draft list., The Dabney definitely has potential, but we we left a little disappointed. It was me and my girlfriend and we ordered 4 dishes along with the two sides of the night. The timing of dishes is probably the biggest flaw. The first 3 items all came out within 5 minutes of each other and then we literally sat there with nothing to eat for probably 45 minutes until our final dish came out. Even when the final dish came out, we had to remind the server about our side dishes that still hadnt shown up.As far as the food, we started with a salad that was nothing special. Next we had the flat bread that was pretty much grilled bread with sauteed onions on it and some greens. Could have made that at home and way better. Then we had the buttermilk biscuit. It was good, not $18 good but tasty. Finally, we had the grilled pork belly with brussel sprouts and grits as a side. The pork belly and brussel sprouts turned the meal around - they were both delicious. The grits were pretty good, not great.For dessert we tried both the apple crumble and the peanut butter cake. Both just seemed to try too hard. The apple crumble was average and we were not huge fans of the bitters ice cream. The peanut butter cake was very good. The celery ice cream was interesting, but we didnt even finish it.Overall, for the price, we thought it was average at best and left us disappointed when compared other hyped restaurants in the area., Creatively crafted American food and drink expertly served by Richard. Started with Leather Britches cocktail - could a cocktail with a name this cute actually taste good? Happily the answer is yes! The Fall Vegetable Salad was a deconstructed slaw with julienned apples, herbs, peanuts with a tiny, perfect dollop of homemade mayonnaise in the center. And what these Dabney folks do with peanuts!* Ember-roasted oysters out of this world! Loved the delicate jus in the shell - coulde drunk a glass of it. The Gr3cner-Veltliner is a must with those two dishes, but we also tried the Barboursville ros39 from Virginia! Who knew? Definitely made us want to wine taste in Virginia. My friend ordered the Buttermilk Biscuit, pronounced it delicious and then ordered the Whistle Pig Hollow Grilled Pork because he was still hungry - or was it because it sounded delicious? It was, in fact, delicious. The Cornmeal-Crusted Blue Catfish had exactly the right crunch, and the sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts provided a complementary contrast - try it - youl see what I mean. When I took my first bite of the catfish, I remembered that catfish is definitely not a bland white-fish. Desserts. Who could choose? So we ordered all three - the Apple Crumble, the Toasted Peanut Butter Cake (see above note re: smart use of the humble peanut), and the Stewed Fragrant Quince with brioche ice cream. The crumble was superb, but our least favorite because the other two were so much more unusual. Celery ice cream on the peanut butter cake sounded a little pretentious, but was the perfect counterpoint to the dense, moist, flavor-intense cake. I was determined not to like anything quince, but loved the tart-like dessert. And I have a new favorite - brioche ice cream. Our server explained that actual brioche is toasted and added to the ice cream during its preparation. The result is creamy and delicately crunchy. The recommended Elio Perrone Moscato dsti was the perfect pairing.The restaurant itself is beautiful - a comfortable, modern white, rustic-beamed space offering elegantly simple, early-American hand-crafted tables and chairs (I think) and an open-kitchen that harkens back to the early 18th century.We are coming back., Beautifully done restaurant and the food was really stellar. We had the farm egg, scallops, and apple crisp which were all delicious. Good cocktail and beer list., If Blagden Alley didn already look like an ad in a Brooklyn, New York magazine, now it does. The Dabney is right in the alley and it brick architecture fits right in. Look for the large glass ceiling to floor window and the small sign that marks the restaurant. There a narrow outdoor terrace at the entrance. You walk inside and there a long bar before you get to the dining area with simple, wood tables. The lights are dim making it a great date spot (Too bad I was here with a buddy rather than my wife!). The kitchen is out in the open with a stone over that roasts many of the dishes you order.It all small plates so plan on splitting whatever you order. We asked the server what to order and she was spot on. In order of what we loved the most: Poached farm egg- It comes with bread and cast iron pot with the most amazing goodness inside. Buttermilk biscuit- We didn order this but they accidentally brought us this on the house (thank you!). It was perfect with the poached egg and maple sauce. Wow. Buffalo river ranch ribeye- Order it medium and it perfectly tender. Grilled cabbage cooked in duck fat- It only $6 and will be the best purple cabbage youl ever eat. Grilled flowering brassicas- This tasted good but it literally just a few vegetables and not worth the $12. The cocktails were spot on. I ordered the ORCHARD SCINTILLANTE and it was perfect. It sweeter (of course) and comes in a champagne glass with an orange peel. At the end of your meal, they bring two hand made cookies. To sum it up, the food was amazing, the atmosphere perfect (even the bathrooms were perfect), and the service spot on. It a tad pricey, but not as much as it could be. If youe looking for a nice restaurant without totally killing your wallet, this is your place. I highly recommend!, Decided to make a reservation here after reading about it in the CityPaper. It just opened less than a month ago, but with all the mentions its been getting (including Gordon Ramsays IG approval!) its probably best to make a reservation; it filled in almost completely by 6:30, but if you come before 6 you probably dont need a reservation on a weeknight. There is also bar seating. We went on a Thursday night and the door was still locked when we got there around 5:30, I didnt notice 5:30 was the open time until then.It is in the alley, you might think youre going the wrong way when walking in, but its there. Its a really well put-together place. Love the tables and the overall theme of the place. Its cozy and the kitchen is open to the seating area.The menu changes by the day, so though it appears they always have a variation of the Pork dish, everything else subject to change. As other yelpers have said, dont come here if youre a vegetarian, there probably wont be many options for you, and in a place with a limited, seasonal menu, its going to be difficult to ask for changes of half the menu items. They do ask if you have any dietary restrictions or allergies, so Im sure some variations are okay, but dont come here if youre super picky.Yelp has this currently as $$ but its definitely $$$. Our waiter recommended at least 2-3 dishes per person, and the dishes range from $12-$28 on the night we were there, but sometimes there are also family style dishes that are more. All of the dishes aside from the sides are listed together, but our waiter said the first 4 items were smaller (salad, flowering brassicas dish, etc.) There are also sides which were around $8-$14. My partner and I ended up getting one main and one side each, which was enough when adding in a dessert each as well. There is a house drinks menu with unique sounding cocktails, that were all $12. There was also 4 beers on draft, and several each of bottled ciders and beers, all were relatively local (MD, DC, VA, PA, NC), keeping with the local theme!I had the cornbread side and the pork shoulder main. The pork was exceptional; falling apart slightly, with two different sauces and topped with a small tower of grilled root vegetables and polenta on the side. I was disappointed with the tiny portion of polenta, but the overall flavors of everything together was on point. My partner chose the fried catfish and the cabbage side. The cabbage side wasnt a whole lot, and looked sad in the larger dish it didnt fill half way. The flavors were good. The catfish breading was falling off, and he said the flavor was good but the fish itself was pretty wet, causing the poor breading situation, but he enjoyed the taste and the sweet potato side. A lot of the menu and accompaniments are cooked over the coals, love all the smoky flavors!For dessert I had the apple crumble. The marshmallow was grilled, which was great for me because I am a smores addict. But, it was more than browned on the top, it was black, so I had to eat around that half. The bitters ice cream was not for me, but the toasted brioche ice cream that came with the quince dessert was amazing, I would eat a large bowl of just that. The quince dessert was sizable, the apple crumble was not as large but still decent. Desserts were $9. Ginger cookies come with your bill. They were small, but tasty, and a little soft in the middle which is the way to be!, Our favorite meal of the year. The best food/drink and as good of service as weve had anywhere. Had a great table near the hearth and open kitchen made for a fun time for my fiance and I to celebrate our annual Christmas dinner. Just the kind of place you want to re-visit time and time again!, Ie visited the Dabney three times since it opened and I can wait to go back. Not only is the space beautifully designed, the food and service is fantastic. Ie got a number of food allergies (which sucks) and theye always willing to work with me. Even with my list of no no, I impressed by the quality and inventiveness of the food. Food allergies aside, you won be disappointed. My fellow diners, who can eat anything, have also given it accolades. My husband, who is an uber critical, tom sietsema wanna-be, didn have a negative. Finally, a farm to table restaurant that deserves every bit of praise it receiving!, Good, not great.At The Dabney, youe paying for ambiance and service because the food is certainly nothing special. Wee all had the farm-to-table New American concept a million times, and here, I was met with disappointment at each ill-conceived yet over-wrought dish. Sorry to say, but the Farmers empire still owns this genre. We made a reservation for 2 a month in advance and were seated promptly on arrival in a beautiful brick-walled, open kitchen setting. We skipped the snacks and dove into the biscuit and winter greens salad instead. For entrees, we opted for the steak and the pork, and for dessert, the peanut butter cake. Each offering was more forgettable than the last, and the only one I order again was the biscuit. Portion size was bigger than expected for all but the two-bite greens. The cake, though. I loved the cheeky ant-on-log theme, but the whole thing was drowning in a sour bath of pure buttermilk. Did anyone taste this before adding it to the menu? This is assuredly a cool spot but not an enviable one., Very cool place. Best way to describe it is like Blue Duck Tavern but 25% more trendy and 25% less expensive. Its simple but creative, with the focus on the ingredients. The food speaks for itself, and we appreciated that it was not overly buttery or oily. We had the sweet potato/pork belly bun, the ham plate, the roast cabbage, BBQ turnips, pork loin, and sweet potato donuts. No wrong choices among that lineup. Highly recommended., Visited the restaurant in December. Loved everything: the food, decor and service.Without a doubt, the highlight of the meal for me was the sunchoke soup. Rich and deep with flavor, it was one of the most delicious tasting soups I have ever had. Perfect for a winter evening.The decor was nice and the tables were well-spaced.Service was very friendly and efficient. No complaints!Hope to have a chance to visit again soon., I would say it was 5 stars, except that we paid $8 for the driest, most flavorless cornbread I have ever tasted. Jiffy cornbread mix is better than this., Good food, great desserts, and creative drinks. Tried the Surreyano ham plate (locally raised pigs in Surrey, Virginia fed on Virginia peanuts as opposed to acorns like Serrano pigs eat), whole fried porgy (which had an Asian influence), and the buttermilk biscuit (Surreyano ham, foie gras, apple, and egg). The grilled brassicas were delicious, but not amazing. However, do not forget to leave room for dessert! You must order the braised quince with BRIOCHE ICE CREAM and the peanut butter cake with CELERY ICE CREAM just to try the ice creams! That peanut butter cake wasnt too shabby either. :-)Additionally, the Dabney has the loveliest restroom Ive ever seen in a restaurant (use the restroom at the end of the hall). The open kitchen adds excitement to the ambiance despite the rustic decor. All in all, a welcome addition the Shaw neighborhood., I was very excited to try The Dabney and am a big fan of the development happening in Blagden Aly. Maybe Im just being overly hopeful and inflating this review a bit, but I want to give this spot another shot! Heres what we got and what we thought:Pork Belly Sliders to start: The sliders were delicious, but at $4 per order, which turned out to be an order of 1 slider, you had to order more than one if you are with someone and want to share...somehow this was strange and felt less organic than ordering the similar steamed bun dish at Momofuku, where they give you three per order and charge the same price per unit.Anson Mills Cornbread ($8): We liked the cornbread a lot! It comes in a small lodge pot, so the presentation is very authentic. We did have to ask for butter, which is obviously important for cornbread.My favorite item on the menu was the Crispy Catfish ($10). Everything was right about this dish, but I wanted more and the portions of catfish could have been more substantial. Heres where things turned...the entrees were a big miss for us. At this point I cant remember their exact names, and they have been taken off the menu... The trout we ordered and the short rib simply did not meet expectations. The trout was bland and the short rib, unreasonably fatty and difficult to cut. Up until that point, I have never sent a dish back to the kitchen in a restaurant as polished and highly recommended as The Dabney.All of these gripes aside, heres where The Dabney redeems itself:First of all, this is a new restaurant with new food suppliers, and a constantly evolving menu. Its really difficult to get everything right. Some of the food was so good that, it would be a shame not to come back...I certainly will be giving The Dabney another try. The service, decor and ambiance of this restaurant is excellent. The lighting is just right, the tables are incredibly cool and the open kitchen is cooler then most, with an open wood burning fire! As a result, The Dabney may be the best smelling restaurant I have ever been in. I think the less discussed, but most noteworthy element of The Dabney is the bar. This has to be one of the most beautiful bar areas I have ever seen, and the drinks were to die for. The Summary: The food didnt meet my expectations, but has incredible potential. The service and ambiance steel the show, and bar area will become your new favorite., Our experience was all over the place. Some aspects I rate as one star and others as four. So, I going to go with two stars. We probably won go back.We received a gift certificate and were excited to try the Dabney. It wasn easy to get a reservation, so this was planned about three weeks in advance. We arrived at 830 on Saturday night. The bar was lively, but the dining area of the restaurant was pleasant and quiet.Our server was nice and certainly meant well. It took a little while for her to come over and introduce herself. We ordered two cocktails. Seeing how busy the bar was, we knew that it would be awhile for the cocktails to come. I didn expect it to take 20 mins, but it did. Before we had our drinks the server asked if we were ready to order. We ordered two small plates to share and then wanted to do the Ribeye for Two as our entree. The server sheepishly said that she thinks that may be out of that but she has to go check. 10 minutes later she finally appears with our drinks and an apology for not telling us sooner that there was no Ribeye. That probably something that she should have mentioned while walking us through the menu. It definitely changes the experience when you have your heart set on something and then are told that you can have it.Here is what we did order:Smoked Trout Dip: This was delicious and came with homemade potato chips.Grilled Brassicas: Definitely try this if it on the menu. Lightly charred vegetables with potato puree and a delicious sauce. This was the highlight in terms of food.Short Rib: We both had this since we couldn have the Ribeye and we didn feel like fish. This is where there was a real problem. One came out amazing and one was pure fat (there seriously was nothing to eat). We mentioned this to the server and she responded Sometimes short ribs are very fatty. I should have taken a picture, there was nothing to eat. She seemed confused as to what to do. She finally offered to have the kitchen make another one which didn take too long. That one was fine.Half-Baked Rye Blondie: This was a yummy dessert.Parts of the experience were good and some not so good. I think that there are better restaurants in the neighborhood. I hope that this one either gets its act together or quickly becomes a passing fad., The atmosphere was inviting and cozy, however the portions are extremely small. The wine list was full of variety, the cocktail menu was creative, and the staff friendly. We came for a birthday dinner as a party of 6. The appetizers were more like bites, and dinner portions tapas sized (6-7 bites). If it hadnt been for the outstanding waiter this would have been a 2 star experience. We also learned the hard way that the bar has its own separate waiting list from the retiring and is not first come as are most other bars. I would recommend this for a nice drink before or after dinner, but wouldnt come here looking for an exceptional meal., Overpriced cracker barrelSmall plates, long waits, and too much noise. We did like the bar program, the bathroom wallpaper, and the hidden locale, but things need to change if they want to keep this train going., We ate an early dinner here on a Friday night and had a great time. The place is still really popular, given that the bar was packed and the restaurant already pretty full when we showed up for a 6:15pm reservation. Im guessing weeknights are a bit easier, but if you want to eat or drink here on a Friday or Saturday youll need to book well in advance. The nice thing about this place is, its worth it.I give The Dabney 5 stars on decor - the layout is great and we scored a great table for two by the kitchen where we could watch all the action. Most of the cooking is done over a wood fire and coals and with an open kitchen everyone can see the open fire - it really gives it a rustic, down-home feel.We started with cocktails (Bittersweet Ending and Weal & Woe), which were delicious, then moved on the baked celery root and roasted hen of the woods mushrooms for appetizers. The mushrooms were the star of the evening and one of the better dishes Ive tasted recently -full of flavor with an excellent presentation. For mains, we had the lacquered quail on a string and pork shoulder in the style of bacon. Both were solid entrees full of flavor. The entrees were a bit cold by the time they reached us, thus the 4 instead of 5 stars.One thing that stood out for me was the excellent service - from the ladies that greeted and seated us, to our waiter and other staff we interacted with during the evening. Overall The Dabney gets it right and well definitely be back., I love the location, ambience, and decor. Its intimate, inviting, and I always love the open kitchen concept. Our server was courteous and knowledgeable, and found the overall waitstaff to be attentive. Our experience with the food varied, but for 2 people, we ended up ordering the following dishes: - Hearth roasted winter vegetables- Celery root w/ brewsters oats, poached egg, rosemary, watercress and sumac puree- A side of charred greens with bone marrow vinaigrette & herbed cheddar breadcrumbs-The chicken liver and foie gras parfait, candied black walnuts, parsnip, orange, & malted barley- Butchers cut (rib eye) w/ sunchoke and endive- Rye blondie with buttermilk ice creamMy favorites included the winter vegetables and the chicken liver parfait (which was a misnomer; it resembled more of a sliver of a slice). They were both well seasoned and the citrus paired extremely well with the earthy and livery taste of the foie gras. The greens and rib eye were tasty, though I found the greens heavy on the pinto beans, and the rib eye was a tad bit too chewy for my liking. The two dishes I liked the least were the celery root puree (I found the egg to be TOO runny, aka undercooked) and the watercress sauce kind of bland. The blondie was alright, as it resembled more of a warm chocolate chip cookie. This is where I take off a star. My date and I enjoy eating at restaurants in D.C. and dont mind paying premium on outstanding food. While the food at the Dabney was enjoyable, the portions were incredibly small and the price point too high. I consider 6 dishes to be enough for two people to feel satisfied, but we ended up going home still hungry, which shouldnt happen when you are paying $75-80 a person. If the portions were increased, or the prices were adjusted to reflect what you are getting ($17-20 for a bite size portion is too much, even in DC) I would go back to have dinner. For now, I can go for a few drinks and take in the cozy atmosphere., Top notch! First of all, this space is gorgeous. Wood-laden, earthy, low lit, open kitchen. Service was impeccable. Water glass never went below halfway mark; servers were helpful and knowledgeable about the food, flavors, and chefs vision with the menu, which by the way is created newly each day. The grilled bread and sourgum butter is BANANAS. The best butter Ive ever had, light and sweet (with fennel pollen). Started with roasted beets and foie gras. Both were nicely plated, well balanced, and sized appropriately for an appetizer. Real gems were the mains though. Boyfriend had the stuffed quail (whos this was delicious and juicy) and I had the pork shoulder (fall apart tender). Very please with our first visit. Cant wait to get back (though well need to call three weeks in advance again!), Try the bar if you cant get a reservation!, What a wonderful experience on the eve of the blizzard! We sat at a table next to the open kitchen and were able to watch this incredible staff ply their craft. The food was exceptional, honest, and hearty with the pork belly sliders, ham tartine and grilled brassicas being particular highlights. The menu changes daily - let your servers guide you. We had 2 cocktails, a bottle of wine and shared 8 dishes ranging from bite sized to entree sized which was perfect as it allowed us to try many things without making ourselves sick. The cocktail menu is stellar and compliments the food perfectly. The service is totally on point - like the food, the servers are straightforward, warm and earthy and able to guide you deftly towards what is best on the menu. Finally, the decor is really beautiful - it felt like a stage set of the American south with an open hearth, rocking chairs, butcher cloth napkins and low lighting. I will be returning (and often!), The Dabney was AWESOME. It was the best meal Ive had in DC this year. I have actually eaten the chefs food at McCradys before in Charleston so I sorta knew what I was in for here. My friend had reservations on a Wednesday night for us. When we first got there it was busy but not bustling and by the time we left the bar space was packed. There arent a ton of tables but the restaurant feels really spacious. I love the decorations, it definitely feels like youre in an old Virginia country home. My friends and I started with cocktails (side note: I love the names of all of them, interesting but not in a hipster/kitschy overkill way). I had the American Trilogy which was very strong (I hope you like bourbon, because I do). My friend had the Apium which was really delicious and refreshing, everyone loved this cocktail. The Bamboomerang was understated but very nice too. Grilled bread with sorghum butter arrived for the table. I love grilled bread and will follow it anywhere and everyone agreed that the sorghum butter was delicious. The charred hen of the woods mushrooms followed. These had a delicious flavor, I could have licked the plate. Next we had the pheasant and cranberry beans. This was a good dish but probably my least favorite. The mustard seeds and the pumpernickel were my favorite aspects of this dish. There was barely any pheasant present and I just dont find cranberry beans that exciting. Next we had the lacquered quail on a string. The oyster stuffing was wonderful and it was exciting to see paw paw in the dish. My friend and I usually go paw paw hunting every year but I have never seen it on a menu before. The addition of that alone was really exciting and showed how much the chef cares about honoring the food of the mid-Atlantic. My favorite dish of the night was definitely our last dish the pork in the style of bacon. You could definitely taste the bacon flavor with the tenderness of perfectly cooked pork. The onions and the greens were fabulous as were the breadcrumbs. I could eat this dish all the time. If I had one complaint about all of the dishes its that there were a lot of foams and purees. It was almost an overdose at points. There were also a little too many pickles, but I personally like pickles so it didnt bother me much. Service was excellent throughout our meal.What the chef is doing here, really celebrating the food of the Mid-Atlantic, is really exciting and I felt really honored to get to witness it. I cant wait to go back. From what I can tell the menu changes almost daily so although you might not see the dishes I ate on the menu when you go, I assume that you will love it., Add another one to the list of overrated, overhyped DC restaurants. The physical setup is quaint and cozy but the food doesnt live up to the buzz. The menu changes every few weeks so perhaps I caught Dabney on an off month as my girlfriend stated that it was much better previously. The mini pork belly buns are great (theyre not on the dinner menu so you have to ask for them) but thats about it. The real menu items sound intriguing and each contains an unnecessary number of ingredients but the end product is rather pedestrian. Started with roasted hen of the woods mushrooms that would have been a nice side dish next to a protein but wasnt anything special on its own. The rockfish was at most 4 inches in length, surrounded by a mix of various bland veggies, and tasted like something youd get at a conference or on an airplane (for $26!). The quail tasted fine mostly because of the stuffing, but was also comically small and otherwise average in quality for the price. The couple next to us were heading to KFC after being unsatisfied with their 5 dishes!Bottom line: get a cocktail and the pork buns at the lively bar but save dinner for nearby Corduroy or Kinship., I loved this place when I first went there, I really did. We went back last night with another couple. The service was still stellar- no complaints on that. I think they are trying to hard or something. I think when we went before they made normal dishes amazing and put a unique spin on them. Now they are just making weird random stuff...and it wasnt great. Ill eat something outside of the box but it still has to be good. The lambs heart was ok. Im not going to go back for that. The mushroom thing tasted like the forest. The beet thing was ok. Pork bacon thing sounded better than it tasted. The whole experience was just OK., First time diner last night. My friend and I got there a few minutes after they opened and it was already getting full. We snagged two seats at the bar. What followed was a really delish meal. We had the sweet potato pork belly rolls followed by charred radishes and a charcuterie platter. We also ordered a side of cornbread in a skillet - yum! I had the blondie to end and that was perfect. Ambiance and service great, would definitely go back., Wonderful experience! The mushrooms, winter vegetable and pheasant were delicious. We shared the peanut butter ice cream sandwich with marshmallow fluff for dessert. Perfect Valentines date., What an incredible place! They are doing everything right from top to bottom. We made our reservation a month in advance because it is so hard to get in with all the hype right now. Let me tell you, it is worth waiting a month for. We were a little late for our reservation since we took a wrong turn on our walk there. They were so nice about it and sat us right away. The decor is adorable and the low lighting instantly feels very relaxing. They sat us in a 2 person table, which I loathe. But really, that is my only complaint of the night. We were far enough away from our neighbor and the acoustics were nicely done, so we didn hear their every word. The server was incredible. She was attentive and informative with all of our questions about the menu. They also do the whole small plate thing so many DC restaurants seem to love right now. They have an awesome drink menu so my husband got the Perpetual IPA and I ordered the Shenandoah. They were both great and the beers are really well priced. After perusing the menu, we decided to order an variety of things and share. We ordered the Hen of the Woods Mushrooms, the Quail, the Heirloom beans with ham and sweet potato and the skillet cornbread. After we ordered they brought us some delicious bread and special honey butter. It was so good that my husband hoarded the butter away so he could put it on the corn bread when it came. Once the food started coming out, we were amazed at how beautifully it was all plated. And the taste matched the elegance of the plating. The mushrooms were so unique and delicious. We had never had anything like them. And the quail with the oyster dressing was out of this world. My husband declared that it was the best thing we had ever had at any restaurant ever. The beans were good and the cornbread was good but maybe a bit too buttery (if that is even possible). Our only complaint is that we wanted more of the mushrooms and quail because they were so amazing. After dinner we thought about dessert, but we were stuffed. When they brought us the check, they also brought out tiny little complimentary cookies that were so cute and so yummy. It was the perfect touch to end an incredible meal. I would highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone., I came here for my birthday and it did not disappoint! I wish I could have eaten a plate of the fried oyster sliders on sweet potato rolls. We also ordered the smoked trout, charred brassicas and two fish entrees. We enjoyed everything, especially the char on the veggies! We also ordered two desserts and enjoyed each bite of them. The cocktails were made well and our waiter for the night was attentive but not overbearing. I loved being able to watch all the food get cooked in the wood fired pit. The ginger cookies at the end was the cherry on top and it was a wonderful meal. It was pricey, but for special occasions its worth it., My experiences at The Dabney have been outstanding. The service, the food, and ambiance have been top-notch. Several courses, cocktails, dessert and a bottle of wine came to around $200 for two people and it was well worth it. There were some items on the menu I wished to try but were all out by the time I came in. I recommend coming in before 9pm if you want to ensure all menu items are available. This would be an excellent place for an anniversary, birthday or special occasion. Highly recommend., When you walk into the Dabney, it feels like home -- a really nice home of someone with great taste in decor. The attention to detail in the decor is paired perfectly with the attention to detail shown in the food.I took clients there and we ordered essentially the whole menu. The biggest problem is describing the best dish because everything was superb. For my taste, the celery root, winter vegtables, Foie, and short rib are the best dishes on the menu. The food was great on many levels - beautiful presentation was followed by nice surprises - a sprig of fresh garnish here, or amazing dots of sauce there - the kind of touches that make stellar food stellar.We could order the whole menu because the food is priced so reasonably. The Dabney is the best food value in DC right now.We choose wine too, and I recommed The Dabney if you like to drink anything - the cocktail program is very strong, and the wine list is carefully curated. There are great mocktails and soda if you want to have a chill night. I recommend talking to Alex about wine - he is able to dial in the perfect wine for your taste. His wine knowledge is boundless.We had a transcendant experience and so will you if you stop by home, I mean the Dabney., Unbelievable flavors, unique and creative dishes served family style so all could enjoy together. The service was impeccable and the attention to detail impressive. Heirloom grains and vegetables such as Brewster oats and sorghum made this a memorable and unique dining experience. Try everything!, I found my experience at the Dabney to be completely underwhelming. I arrived with my date and we headed to the bar to get a cocktail while we were waiting for our table. After ordering, we waited more than five minutes without receiving our drinks. Finally, we asked the hostess if they could just bring the drinks over to our table since we were apparently forgotten about.Once we got to the table, our waiter started off by telling our group not to bother to ask him for recommendations because the menu changes so frequently. His tone suggested that he really didn want to deal with any questions from the table.None of the dishes we ordered were really standouts. The dessert (a cinnamon mini donut dish) was good but only came with three tiny donuts (and when I say tiny I talking maybe two inches in diameter!) We asked the waiter for an extra so each person in our group of four could try one. He acted as if we had asked him to move mountains! So after we paid $9 for three tiny donuts, our group left with a bitter taste.All in all, we paid about 75 dollars a person for subpar service and a meal that was mediocre at best.I wouldn be eager to go back. There are better new restaurants in town that have a lot better value and service., Elegant, cozy, delicious - we loved our meal here. My husband has several food allergies which make dining out a challenge: gluten, soy, dairy, egg. I emailed the Dabney in advance to see if they could accommodate him for at least an appetizer and entree, and they responded that itd be no problem. We informed our server of his allergies, she consulted with the chef, and came back to let us know nearly the entire menu could be modified to avoid my husbands allergies - only 2 dishes could not. I had the beets and goat cheese and my husband had the mushrooms to start, then we shared the butchers cut steak, the pork, and a side of cabbage - everything was melt in your mouth delicious. The pork is a tenderloin prepared in a way that it tastes just like bacon - absolutely decadent. The steak was so tender it fell apart with a fork. Most of the garnishes sounded quite foreign to us when reading the menu, but we gladly dove right in to the various foams and crumbles that topped our dishes and the flavors were unique and delicious.It is such a relief to enjoy such an excellent meal in a restaurant where we feel confident that the server, the chef, and even the dish runners understood my husbands allergies. We certainly understand he is a difficult customer to accommodate and dont expect more than a dish or two he can have (usually a simple grilled steak and a sauteed veggie). The Dabney went above and beyond our expectations and well definitely be back., The Dabney is amazing. Its like this perfect little cozy oasis hidden in Blagden Alley that just knows how to provide a quality experience. Ive eaten here three times and I believe its gotten better each time Ive gone (This is no easy task. The second time was a homerun birthday dinner featuring a 22oz Ribeye for 2). While waiting on a table, it should be mentioned that I had perhaps the single best bar snack of my life: pork belly, watermelon molasses, pickled veggies on a sweet potato roll. Its like one of Momofukus pork buns but with a southern twist and a million times better. Most recently the star of the night was quail, stuffed with an oyster stuffing. Prior to that I had started with the winter vegetable salad and the grilled lamb heart and potato soup. Finished up with the sweet potato doughnuts and a Chartreuse VEP. Absolutely an incredible experience. Everything (even the bathrooms- and I rarely notice stiff like how perfect the bathrooms are designed) is incredibly well thought out and decorated. The hearth is a phenomenal centerpiece... Basically, I loved it and after writing this review and revisiting it in my mind, I think Ill go back tonight for round 4. Hopefully I can get in!, The Dabney had been on my list for quit some time so leading up to our reservation I had very high hopes for the restaurant as a whole. My expectations were so far surpassed. Im a bit of a foodie and decor snob, having dined at some of the top restaurants around the world - and I can honestly say that The Dabney is in my list of top restaurants -- best in DC for sure. Our server, Samantha, was so knowledgeable about food, wine, the menu and the food scene in the US. She was so pleasant and really made our night so pleasant. The cocktails we had at the bar prior to our meal were perfect, the bartender made them with such care - even though he was busy he made sure to check in with us to make sure we liked our drinks. The vibe is great - I wouldnt go with a party larger than 4/6, but it was a beautiful spot for a date. I couldnt stop thinking about our meal for days - really wonderful!, Cyndys Bottom Line: Well executed & creative dishes using interesting ingredients resulting in robust flavors.House made ciabatta bread grilled to perfection served with a sorghum butter.Side of Bloody Butcher CornbreadLoved the texture of the cornbread and the delicious buttery and savory flavor.Celery Root Baked in the Embersfarro, lardo, poached egg, rosemary, watercress, & sumacA beautiful plated dish. The watercress is tender and provides an aesthetic look to the plate. The farro was cooked perfectly and absorbed the delicious richness of poached egg together with the lardo. Lacquered QuailChesapeake oyster stuffing, brown butter, greens, and paw paw.A beautifully plated dish. The quail was nicely rolled with the delicious oyster stuffing and sliced up on the plate. Easy and delicious to eat. The stuffing was seasoned well and flavorful. The quail cooked perfectly.Whistle Pig Pork in the style of BaconOnions cooked in whey, winter greens, & Virginia maple syrup.The pork was delicious but somehow came out a tad overdone.Ice cream sandwichDouble chocolate chip cookie, peanut butter ice cream, & sumac.A decadent double chocolate cookie! I loved the cookie the best!Petit fours A plate of cookies. Loved the pecan cookie!, This was a wonderful Tuesday evening. I loved my dabney version of an old fashion at the bar and LOVE the fact that no music was blasting over our voices so we could talk to each other without screaming! The service was great and the decor was quaint and cozy. My only disappointment was the portion of my meal. Rockfish and turnips : I expected a hearty side of veggies to accompany my tiny sliver of fish. Sigh! That being said i knew that would happen. So, Although im no chef. Please! While i know flavors are important, a proper portion is still expected. I dont want to eat dessert. I just want the main course to be amazingly fulfilling. At least warrant the price tag. Till next time!, This place is amazing. My girl friend and I ventured to this a little off the beaten path spot. Everything in this place is deliberate from the open kitchen to the plating to the open fire stove. Our server was able to answer any question we had about the menu or the drinks and give recommendations (which were delicious I might add). We ordered the short ribs, roasted veggies, corn bread, and quail. Complimentary bread: I was a baker for a living for a short while. The ciabatta bread with the whipped honey butter here is amongst the best pieces of bread I have ever had.Roasted veggies: dish is a bit small but, the flavor are out of this world. The mushrooms are simply heavenly and the charring on true veggies is perfect.Corn bread: wish this had come out before the meal but it was wonderful ended up boxing it up and taking it home.Short ribs: could be cut with a spoon just fell apart in your mouth in the best possible way. the flavoring was amazing as well. I realized I found myself hoping I would get food stuck in my teeth so I could enjoy it again later.Quail: gf loved this dish she was disappointed it came with so much greenery until she tried it and the fork never left her hands from that point forward. Desserts both the Devils food cake and the custard. Both plates were scraped clean and if licking your bowl wasnt frowned upon you might have caught me rocking the manners of lady and the tramp. Well worth the dollars, If youd like to go to the Dabney make sure to make reservations WAY in advance. I had to make reservations at least a month out -- which is fine, but if you dont anticipate this then you might have an unpleasant wait.QUICK READ: You will order a pizza a few hours after you leave the Dabney. A few of us went last week, and while we had no problems with the seating or service. The decor is rustic hipster farmhouse and the staff are all wearing plaid. The menu is quasi-small plates, I say quasi because staff claim that some entrees are larger (key word: claim). I found that for the cost, the food isnt worth it. While the food was delicious, the portion sizes are extremely small for the price. We ordered the recommended number of plates per person (2 or 3 per person) and we all found ourselves leaving slightly unsatisfied and ended up ordering pizza a few hours later. If youre trying to keep your date from getting fat, go here. If youre going somewhere to eat, skip the Dabney., Finally tried The Dabney for dinner last night. It was busy for a Tuesday night! Put our name on the list and then had a drink at The Columbia Room next door while we waited. Menu is always changing, but the food last night was really good, especially the pork on a bed of cooked onions, wow. Everything was very fresh, flavorful....thoughtful. You could tell the chef really thinks about how the ingredients mesh and what flavors he wants., No beating around the bush: the food is spectacular. The dishes are fairly small, so I would recommend at least a side and appetizer to share. We had the biscuit, a side of cuy sum, and the seared fluke. Oh baby all were so good. Expertly prepared and artful plating to match. My one crticism is that when we went the menu was too heavy on pork options. I think there was only one or maybe two non-pork entrees, and of course my date could not try any of those.That didnt stop us from enjoying ourselves though. The decor is dark, great for a date, and it really feels like an alley restaurant. The entrance is all windows letting you see in, and keeping with that theme, the kitchen is out in the open as well, with the cooks doing their thing in front of a giant fireplace for all to see.Some interesting cocktails available, too, so I went with the Gentlemens bet. It was blackberry with bourbon - strong and delicious. Delightful. Bonus points for great service. I just wish I had room for the peanut butter pie! But thankfully the check came with complimentary shortbread cookies, which were very tasty. They are a bit pricey, but for the quality, it is definitely worth it. You will not feel an ounce of buyers remorse. Highly recommended!, A hidden, wonderful gem. What a scrumptious meal experience. I felt as though I was a judge on Top Chef eating a finale 5 course meal. I not going to describe the food, because that fucking boring. Just know, it delicious...that all that needs to be said. The barkeep, Julian, should be called a cocktail consultant, because the word bartender sounds like a demotion. Excellent service, excellent ambiance, excellent food., Hell Yeah! Great ambiance in a niche spot tucked into the corner of Shaw with great energy, delicious food and excellent service. The incomparable, Athena Marie, welcomed us with grace and charm, and we dined on roasted beets, foie gras, whistle pig pork in the style of bacon and a beautiful lacquered quail with a chesapeake oyster stuffing. 20 years in the food and wine industry and a foodie at heart, I can without hesitation recommend making this reservation a month ahead for that special date-to-be-wowed. Cant wait for seconds., Not often do you go to a restaurant and get blown away by each offering. I cannot tell you how impressed I am with the food and service. I highly recommend giving them a try. The atmosphere is warm and you can see the master chefs work as they cook your meal., The building is beautiful and we were close to the kitchen so we could see the meals being prepared. The short ribs, bread, farro, and pork were all delicious, although I was slightly disappointed with the dessert (we had cider ice cream) and mushroom appetizers. The portions are definitely tapas size (not slightly larger than tapas like they claim), which can quickly make the meal expensive without filling you up. The drinks were top-notch.
70|the-lafayette-washington|Ok, so maybe because it is a five-star hotel that I liked it so much. But the service was superb and they were quick to fufill any requests. The hotel staff was friendly and inviting and the concierge was very helpful in navigating Washington D.C. I recommend it to everyone who can afford this price-range., I came to Lafayette for a business lunch, and was treated to the best chicken salad Ie ever had in my life. Ever since this experience, I have been searching and searching to no avail for a chicken salad that even comes close. The dining area is beautiful, attached to the five star Hay-Adams Hotel near the White House. The service is excellent, and I would really love to come back here sometime for dinner. I guessing a lot of important people come here, because the other guests were a bit stuffy -- which is my only complaint. It is a bit pricey, as you may have guessed. hayadams.com/Dining/lafa206, Nice, solid food. Great, historic location. A little on the adult side. This is a place for lobbyists, the wealthy, the wannabe wealthy. Ie eaten here several times and found it to be the perfect place for lunch or dinner, with dependable, friendly, professional service and a surprisingly warm atmosphere given that it could easily tilt to the stuffy side.The views during lunch are better, particularly when it sunny. By the way, i think this is where people like G. Gordon Liddy plotted the fire-bombing of the Brookings Institution. So, think about that when you eat there planning something less (hopefully) historic. :), This place is near the White House. Have heard big shots hang out here but I was not impressed with the food or the service. The place had a stuffiness to it. It did not live up to its look and up-tightness., An embarrassment. Coasting on fumes. Service was slow and inaccurate, though piano is nice touch. Decor is cute but lobby noise rivals the piano. Food is a joke, especially at these prices. Scallop was dominated by heat from its garnish. Duck was cooked at too low a temperature and had to be sent back, and polenta was flavorless mush. Save a few dollars and get a much better meal at Equinox or the Oval Room around the corner., Went for prix fixe valentines day. ambience was romantic, but kind of stuffy. Piano was nice, little chocolate hearts on the table, was VERY expensive for quality of food. I thought the food was not that great. Notable for things cut up in microsize pieces- strawberry tartar, salad with itsy bitsy pears, peppers, equivalent to a single bite in the salad, sea bass with oyster cream and celery, carrots, again micro bites and heart shaped potatoes- undercooked, my husbands filet was overcooked and chewy. Dessert was nice, but not to die for. Overall disappointing. Went to use the restrooms and say the bar-- that looked like the place to eat- less stuffy, but quiet and romantic, off the a la carte menu with some wine....wished wed tried that instead., The Lafayette at the historic Hay Adams was the perfect setting for a very memorable anniversary dinner. It was truly a 5 star experience. The ambiance is elegant and classy without being too stuffy. There was a talented pianist that added to the lovely atmosphere. All of the food we had was prepared perfectly, which included appetizers, main course and dessert. Even the selection of breads that was served before the meal was fantastic and unique. The server was extremely professional and gave us great recommendations. To top it all off, since I commented it was our anniversary on the reservation we were given complimentary dessert wine and chocolates. Wonderful experience, highly recommend!, This place was perfect for brunch. After taking a tour of the White House, we had reservations for brunch. It was exquisite. It is great for a power brunch with a very classy and elegant ambiance. We had around eight people at our table, and everyone ordered everything from gourmet eggs Benedict, Belgium waffles, to various fresh fruit inspired dishes. Brunch was accompanied by great service, attentive waitstaff, and fresh juices. You simply cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. (Do not expect to order a Bloody Mary with brunch). Make reservations, as this place is very popular., Ive eaten at the Lafayette previously on client business. Other than the fact that the restaurant sells farm-raised fish, I have found the food to be quite good, the ambiance outstanding, and the detailed service exceptional. (I do note that at least one waiter does not know the rules of formal etiquette, however, its not like I was dining with the president!) On this day, I took a group of friends for after-dinner drinks and one dessert in particular, the souffle. Its one of the top two souffles I have ever had in my life--a vanilla souffle with a subtle grand marnier sauce. The Lafayette should have a tour of the kitchen during the souffle preparation...The bottom line is that this is a great place to come for souffle and after dinner drinks bc the menu is so overpriced. Disclaimer--souffle and after dinner drinks do add up!, I had the great privilege to be treated here by my aunt and uncle yesterday evening. It was kind of a surreal experience! About 6 people waited on our table, some just to change the silverware between courses. They were all very courteous and friendly. They give you either a white or black cloth napkin depending on what color your pants/dress are so you dont get lint on them (!). The window we sat in front of looked right out on the White House (!). But, most importantly, the food was delicious. I had the Sun Dried Tomato Crusted Virginia Lamb Loin - scrumptious! And their soup of the day - New England clam chowder - which was fine but nothing to write home about. I should have gotten the Butterhead Salad like my aunt suggested - it looked delicious. Their cosmo was one of the most delicious I had ever had -not too sweet or tangy - just perfect. And for dessert I tried a Baked Alaska for the first time in my life - unbelievable! I doubt I will return here anytime soon, unless we somehow hit the jackpot, BUT I would recommend this very beautiful, classy restaurant to anyone who is celebrating a VERY special event or wants to splurge for an exciting occasion, etc., Are you looking for a truly fabulous brunch? Is the tab being handled? Well then, darling, you simply must brunch at The Lafayette. Brunch here works as such: unlimited champagne, mimosas, or Bloody Marys; buffet style hors deuvres and dessert; menu choice of entr39e. My favorite appetizers were the shrimp, crab claws, lox, and marinated, grilled vegetables. Many of the offerings include mayo-based salads, which I found a bit odd. For my entr39e, I had the sea bass over greens and mashed. The sea bass had a perfect sear on it, while not being overcooked; the accompaniments were tasty. For dessert, I loved the strawberries with fresh whipped cream, served in a martini glass; I stole some macarons from a chocolate mousse type dish, and the macarons (pistachio, I think) were great. I drank way more of my fill of champagne; brunch was a beautiful three hours, and I was definitely foxed (if you are familiar with an older, currently unused meaning of the word).Service is, of course, exactly what you would expect: polite, polished, and professional. No one needed to ask if I was finished; silverware positioning provided the cue. Water and champagne were automatically refilled, napkins folded, chair held when needed. In speaking with some of the servers, I learned that many have worked here for years, and it was quite a familial environment, which is nice.D39cor is elegant with plenty of natural light in the dining area. A pianist adds even more grandeur to the experience. And could the location be any more perfect? While it was not crowded this particular Sunday, I hear that it can be. This is a brunch to exceed all others., We stayed at the Hay Adams Hotel this week. My wife, two daughters and I decided to dine in the Lafayette Room one night. We were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. It was truly a wonderful dining experience. The room is gorgeous. The service impeccable. And the food--simple, classic, and perfect. From the delicious appetizers, to delightful entrees (the Dover Sole exceptionally fine), and excellent desserts--we enjoyed a meal that well all remember for a long time., had a fantastic last minute breakfast here with my husband. It was great food at a reasonable price. Also this place has a lot of history, all presidents stay here before they get inaugurated which I find really cool., $75 each for brunch. Whats that you said? Im an idiot? Youre so right.Lovely room, lovely table. Mimosas were good, and Im expecting the best. Oops.I know its hard to steam shrimp until theyre actually no longer sushi, but when youre asked to make some that are cooked, bringing back 3 (three) shrimp still hot from the kitchen is not, as they say here, au fait. And really, is it too much to ask that the home-style potatoes be warm? After Ive asked for some specially to be heated really hot, I would think that above room temp would be de rigeur. And if you are a 5 star restaurant, you really shouldnt auction off the food, especially if you have the ticket in your hand showing who ordered what.I know Im a picky yelper, but at this level, you have to do better than this. In general, the buffet portion wasnt all that great (some of the crab claws showed freezer burn, the capers for the smoked salmon were dried out), the entrees were OK, but not wonderful (when you poach eggs, be careful not to let the water get too hot, as it will cook the outside of the white before the inside of the white is done. Which is gross.) And in general the whole thing was hugely disappointing. Not to mention wincingly expensive.Like I said, Im an idiot. If you go to brunch here, you will be too., My husband and I had dinner here for the first time on Valentines Day. I thought their dining room was on the roof and found that their rooftop meals are saved for holidays and days like Mothers Day. Holidays aside, this place did not disappoint. We had their five course dinner. (I also went with wine pairing):smoked salmon, roasted beets; tuna carpaccio, sunchoke veloute; lobster ravioli, diver scallop; beef fillet, halibut; dulce de leche chocolate layer cakeIll just list the two minor cons we had: ravioli wrapping was very thick and the beef fillet was fine. Considering The Lafayettes reputation, all of it should have been outstanding - they came pretty close though. Our dinner definitely compels us to go back again. Whomever chose the wine selection for this evening is great, I would love for him/her to choose my wine daily!Wine pairing: Gobelsburger Kamptal 2011, Taittinger, Strub Soil to Soul Riesling 2011, Hess Vineyards Allomi Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2009.I cant decided between the Kamtal and the Soil to Soul for my favorite. My husband ordered the white burgundy and that was great too.Its unfortunate that there are negative reviews for this place, but we were more than satisfied. We received good service and walked away with a souvenir menu and a small box of chocolates., 5 stars for sure...though I will give a disclaimer of what 5 stars signifies for me aside from stellar food from appetizer to dessert.*Impeccable service and staff. Not a flaw anywhere and being treated in a Regal / Royal manner.*Impeccable surroundings and ambiance, including place settings, silverware and drinking glasses.*REAL butter and a variety of warm delicious bread.*Fabulous wine list with selections that make my mouth water and taste buds salivate.*And, REAL WHIPPED CREAM even when its not on the menu and you ask for it and they gladly whip it up and it tastes like something the Angels just made and sent down from Heaven.That, to me, is true 5 star dining, and something that isnt found too frequently any more despite the rising popularity in the foodie culture.***And, not really part of my 5 star dining list but icing on the cake so to speak...when the kitchen can also prepare me a burger to go for my regal Pekingese. It makes both him and me happy as can be. :-)Ignore those nay-sayers. They are foolish and do not know what they are speaking about. Of course you expect to pay a high price in such a lovely setting smack dab across from the White House...silly people. And actually its not too expensive for what you are getting., Great hotel restaurant but rated three stars because the price is such a deterrent. Come on man... Eggs shouldnt cost that much. Everything is overpriced but the atmosphere is sophisticated and very special. If youre getting engaged and this is where you pop the question then go here. If youre hanging out with old people over tea and coffee then go here. Food is average. You are paying for a historical special breakfast., For a classy brunch (and expensive), this place is as good as it gets in DC! I went with my parents and they had an amazing time. Such a beautiful setting and an incredible food buffet. If you want a swanky brunch, this place is it!, If you would like to have an experience that you will remember for a long time then dinner at The Lafayette is a must. Right from making a take reservation (and yes that is highly recommended) to the meal is guaranteed to spoil you.The hotel is totally worth checking out - right by the White House, and the beautiful decoration inside make the experience that much better.From the moment you drop your car off at the valet thru to checking it with the ma3etre d and the entire meal, you are treated like royalty.They have an extensive wine list and quite a few good wines from USA - CA, etc. I have generally not seen such an extensive list of wines made in USA at an upscale restaurant - like everything French is good and anything US made is bad!Needless to say, the food here is excellent. I had the Corn Bisque soup for appetizer and Rack of Lamb for man course. The lamb was cooked to perfection - medium rare for me. Meat was tender and full of flavor.I was surprised that the final check was reasonable and less than what I had expected it to be (tho miles away from a McD budget).This place should be on the top of the list if you want an awesome, upscale dining experience at an impressive location., Romanceeeey time! The Lafayette is one of my bfs favorite restaurants, and we finally had a chance to dine here recently. This is one of the fanciest restaurants Ive ever been to. Located across the street from the White House, this place is full of suits, diamond/pearls, and Hermes scarves. The room is bright and airy, and is charmingly decorated - very elegant and simple. Get a table by the window for lovely views of DC and swoon. So while the restaurant is very nice, the food is good, but not great. The bread service is spectacular, yes. We could have eaten the whole basket of goodies. I started with a simple green salad that was severely overdressed and Bill had the lobster bisque, which he devoured. For our entrees, we both had grilled salmon (off the menu). It was served over a bed of couscous and seasonal vegetables. It was drenched in butter, and very good! If youre going to indulge in dessert, I highly recommend the Chocolate Terrine. Its like eating a super rich chocolate bar - but 1,000 better. Served with a yummy scoop of pistachio ice cream, its hard to share. Overall, I really enjoyed Lafayette. Well be back to try their brunch menu. Im pretty sure there was a secret service agent standing outside the mens restroom. I wonder if he knows Carrie Mathison., Fantastic! My fianc39 and I had one of our best meals in recent memory at The Lafayette. It was simply delicious and the service was impeccable. It was a nice atmosphere as well and we were to happy to walk into a warm, inviting restaurant inside the Hay Adams hotel (which was bedecked with lovely Christmas decorations) and out from the nippy December cold. The restaurant was fairly empty when we arrived (it was a cold Thursday December evening and still early for dinner - 6pm), but was more crowded when we left after our meal. From beginning to end, the service was friendly and very attentive. The atmosphere is lovely and classy. It was very private and romantic for us and we had the pleasure of hearing a pianist play for us. We ordered the following: -Appetizer: Lobster Salad. We each ordered one of these and loved it. The lobster portion was very generous and tasted so juicy and tender. Perfection.-Entree for me: Diver Scallops (spaghetti squash, kaleidoscope carrots, coconut lobster sauce). This was surprisingly very filling. It was delicious and unique and perfect.-Entree for my fianc39: Filet Mignon special. He loved this and said it was a great portion. -Dessert: I rarely ever have enough room by the time I get to the dessert course, but there was something so inviting about the restaurant and I wanted to stay longer. I was also enticed by the option of having sorbet. I had a combination of raspberry and coconut sorbets and fresh berries on the side. My fianc39 ordered something of the chocolate variety. In addition, we got a complimentary butternut squash soup to taste and we loved the table bread. And at the end, they also gave us two complimentary chocolates, much to my fianc39s delight ;) We also ordered wine with our dinner - a riesling for me and a Merlot for my fianc39, to accompany our scallops and steak respectively. Perfect pairings. I absolutely loved this experience. We both felt that we wished we had gone there for our engagement dinner back in March! But at least now we have a solid and tested option for future special occasions (once I exhaust my ever-growing list of new places I have to try)! :) I absolutely recommend The Lafayette. We will certainly return!, The Lafayette restaurant in the historic Hay Adams hotel is... the restaurant you expect a French revolutionary diplomat who was friends with George Washington to eat at. Lets just say... you don want to drive your beat up 2007 Hyundai Sonata to be valeted. No siree. Just... park that yoelf. The restaurant itself looks to be a replica of a room in the White House. The silverware is definitely real silver and the jam for your toast is served out of miniature sealed jam jars. Yes... that is an important detail. I watch as a table is prepared for 3 men in suits. The white napkins are exchanged for black (ensuring no white threads get on their suit pants). A family across from me looks to be out of a Modern Washington DC Christmas Card. The woman with Hillary Clinton hair, an Obama O broach made out of semi precious stones, and 2 daughters wearing both conservative and formal dresses. The waiter is attentive without being overbearing. My corned beef hash is a solid version of an all time brunch favorite. The eggs are perfectly poached. The slice of country ham I order on the side has meticulously made hash marks. Coffee is served in mugs where you are forced to pinch the handle because you can put your finger through the delicate small hole. All chairs are antiques, crown molding overfloweth, and the bathroom has individually rolled linen hand towels cause... paper... gross. I love this place., The Lafayette was an outstanding setting for a group dinner event. The balcony views overlooking The White House is an experience to remember. The food was fantastic as well., I have no idea why this place does not come in as a five star. The whole experience is impeccably amazing! Everything, from first entering, dining, socializing and parting, far exceeds FIRST RATE! We were treated as royalty with the utmost sincerity, courtesy and caring; we really regretted the night coming to a close. If we lived in the DC area, I have no doubt, we would be regulars at The Lafayette. NICE!, Five star for the service, taste of food and quality. I love the ambiance too. The price is cheaper than what we are expecting. I would definitely recommend., You definitely get what you pay for - and while its more than Id choose to spend on the typical Sunday brunch, it is superb! Even though the lobster benedict I ordered as my main brunch entree was great, I will say that the appetizer buffet was even better! There was an incredible variety of appetizers, from specialty salads to freshly baked breads to grilled vegetables to gourmet cheeses to fresh seafood galore! I couldnt choose a favorite if you asked., Had lunch here on a Saturday afternoon and enjoyed my experience very much.The atmosphere is very elegant and the service is great. The menu is somewhat limited, and not too many dishes jump out as very original. But, everything I had was executed well.Downside: The desserts are not very good. We had 4-5 different kinds amongst my party and they were all unremarkable. Also, my creme brulee was visibly burnt, which left an acrid taste in my mouth. I was not able to eat half my dessert. For $12, I was expecting the best creme brulee east of the Mississippi., Service at this restaurant is far from the level of this kind of establishment. I reserved a table for five to celebrate my birthday with brunch, and while the food was delicious, the establishment fell short on the management/service front. The biggest issues was the rudeness of the manager, who approached the table and said in an inappropriately brusque manner that we must order immediately. The waiter had explained only a minute before that the kitchen was preparing the brunch buffet, but that is no excuse to treat us in any but a professional manner. When I tried to order the souffl39, the waiter said it would take 30-35 minutes to prepare, while the menu quoted a 20-minute preparation. The restaurant also serves Fuji brand water instead of regular tap water. Bottled water like this is a big contributor to climate change and wasted resources, especially when it is hauled across our oceans via giant diesel-spewing tanker ships. This practice appears to be endorsed by the management in yet another strange decision. DC has many terrific brunch places, so I recommend visiting them and getting good service along with the good food., My husband and I dined at the Lafayette for Sunday brunch, where we had impeccable service, excellent food ($80 per person), unlimited champagne, appetizers, desserts, etc. We were also permitted to choose one entree from a menu. I had the crab cakes while my husband had the steak frites - both were excellent. The appetizer buffet was plentiful and could have very well been the entire brunch. The croissants and pastries were amazing. The seafood - shrimp ceviche, smoked salmon, seared tuna - from the appetizer buffet were all excellent. The staff was so incredibly welcoming and polite. It is hard to find service like the Lafayette these days. Definitely want to dress appropriately for the Lafayette - a Sunday best brunch attire is recommended! Ladies - nice dress and heels ;) Men - coat is best! Also - I would absolutely recommend this place for Mothers Day or any other special occasion., We had a wedding celebration dinner for a party of 10 in the private dining room on May 7th that left everyone with a distaste for the Lafayette. Our waiter Anthony was very rude and unaccommodating. From the moment we arrived, we did not feel welcomed but instead felt rushed through dinner.Since the Lafayette does allow bottle corking, we decided to bring 6 nice bottles of some very nice wine. At some point during the dinner, I noticed the empty bottles being cleared and when I looked over to the corner table where the wine was being held, I saw that there were still 2 bottles of wine that hadn been opened. After ordering the dessert, I noticed that the 2 bottles were gone and when I asked about them, Anthony informed me that all 6 bottles had been poured. Several minutes later, a few other members in our party mentioned that there were 2 unopened bottles that seem to have disappeared. Upon paying our bill, we mentioned this situation to Anthony again and he said to hold on, after which he returned with 6 empty bottles, all too ready for our concern. We firmly believe that Anthony wanted to get us out sooner and poured out the 2 bottles. Although this allegation may sound odd, the fact that several members in our party noticed 2 unopened bottles that suddenly had disappeared leads us to believe that this is the only thing that could have happened. Even so, when our wine glasses were empty, any ma3etre din a 5-star establishment would offer a wine list selection, but Anthony just cleared our glasses from the table. He obviously did not want us to stay any longer.When ordering dessert, I asked to order the Pistachio souffl39 and Anthony said it would take 25-30 minutes. Since I knew 3 people wanted to order the pistachio souffl39, I asked to place 3 orders. Again, Anthony brought it to my attention that they take 25-30 minutes, which I understood the first time he told me. Again, another indication he wanted us out.Another situation brought to my attention was when Anthony was taking our dessert order, 2 members of our party asked if they could order a cappuccino and espresso with their dessert. Anthony responded that he wasn taking coffee orders and that they could order on the next round. Lastly, when our utensils were being replenished for dessert, I saw Anthony pick up un-used utensils from one person in our party and place it in front of another person in our party. I don think this is standard practice in a supposed 5-star establishment. We have had plenty of fine dining experiences and this definitely wasn one of them. Food was mediocre and wasn anything that would make me want to try this restaurant again. As we expected much better service from this restaurant, I wanted to make the manager aware of our experience. When I finally got a hold of him 3 weeks after our dinner, he said he was there and saw all 6 bottles of wine. My first thought was, Wouldn and shouldn a manager at least greet a large dinner party at some point during the dinner to make sure everything was running smoothly? Overall, a waste of an experience and sad that I recommended this place to celebrate a wedding. If you want a nice dining experience, go to Plume or any restaurant on 14th street for that matter. If you still decide do go after this review and end up with Anthony as your waiter, request someone else., A few friends and I went to The Lafayette for my birthday and another one of my friends birthdays. We made reservations and were asked if we were celebrating, so they knew we were there for a big experience before we even arrived. The decor is amazing, the service is outstanding, and the food is nothing less than perfect. Our waiter, Clarence, was one of the best waiters Ive ever had serve me. He was so helpful with menu choices, he had perfect timing for everything, he was very easy to talk to and gave us great spots to go as far as night life after dinner. We followed all of his recommendations and were more than pleased. One of our friends is vegan and he made excellent accommodations to her dish so that she could eat. We all loved everything about it, and to top it off he gave us a beautiful birthday dessert on him (baked Alaska! get it!) Go to The Lafayette if you want a true fine-dining experience and if you can, get Clarence to serve you!, I had such a great experience at The Lafayette. I only stayed in DC for one night and Im so glad me and my friends picked this place. Clarence was our waiter and I honestly wish he could be my personal waiter every time I went out to eat. He was awesome! He knew what he was talking about, and sold us on the dinner specials, which was phenomenal. He made sure our glasses of champagne were always full. And he was very good at connecting with us even though we arent from the area. Definitely a great experience, and I would recommend this place, and Clarence, to everyone I know., Yes yes yes! The perfect service and food. This is the place when you wanna take someone important to you. The server, even the reception, all people are well trained. The food reflects the service and the quality, definitely come back again!!, Old world luxury and style, with excellent food and service. Good wine list. Nice decor, and quiet., Amazing service, amazing wait staff, amazing food. High class atmosphere!
71|the-partisan-washington|Ate here with the husband and really enjoyed it. First, the decor is warm and cozy. A great bar (beautiful) towards the back. The menu is very inventive with small plates and large ones. Thereby has small icons that tells you what type of food. For instance, the seafood portion has a fish icon and so forth. Prices are very reasonable. Great add to the neighborhood., 3.5 stars- great food and ambiance, but the portions are a bit too small Party of 4 arrived for dinner on Friday 3/14/14 at about 6:45pm. We waited about 30 minutes for a table, ended up in the back section where the bar is, we all loved the ambiance Dinner: delicious, but the portions are a bit too small. We all shared the: brussel sprout salad - great but nothing new beef fat fries - great, crispy, we asked for a 2nd order  pork bolognese - DELICIOUS, handmade pasta, we asked for a 2nd order  rotissi-fried chicken - DELICIOUS, comes with a spicy dipping sauce lamb shawarma - DELICIOUS, not too gamey braised spanish octopus - good, the sauce it was in was marinara ribeye cap - good but nothing newDessert: snickers terrine and apple pie- both were great, the tarine was incredibly rich so beware of that Service: great, considering it was their 3rd night open. We asked the waiter what his favorite dishes were and he replied everything -- not the answer we were looking but we did enjoy everything we had, just wish we had more of it, My partner and I went to The Partisan during its opening week, and unfortunately, the great vibe does not match the rather mediocre food. We really wanted to like this place because we enjoy Red Apron in Union Market, but I just don think this restaurant is up to snuff.I will say that the atmosphere is very cool and hip. We had a reservation, but we showed up a little bit early to have drinks at the bar. The bar itself is impressive, they have a lot of beers and wines on tap. You can get any food at the bar, so we had the beef jerky and the pork rinds to start. The jerky was just jerky, nothing special at all. The pork rinds were good, but the barbecue sauce that accompanied it was mediocre at best. (I guess you could say that my partner is a barbecue snob, since he from Kansas City.) But especially with such an emphasis on meat, The Partisan really got the barbecue sauce wrong. The drinks he had at the bar were okay. The bartender recommended some boring wines, and the sparkling Riesling was just average. Their cocktail menu, however, is very good and inventive -- that the best aspect of this restaurant.Once we sat down, the vibe was more intimate, with darker colors and lower lighting. The place is basically tapas style, and we were specifically trying to prevent overeating. We started with the lamb schwarma, which was the best dish we had. Crispy lamb edges, but instead of a pita they gave you these bread circles that came with any other dish. The lamb was good, but it wasn a completely well-executed dish, as there was barely enough for two people. Then, we ordered their porterhouse, which was a serving for two of a big pork cut. I really wanted to like this dish because I had read about it before we went here, but it just didn do it for me. There were some good parts of the pork, but definitely not enough. The pork was rather overcooked, and charred in other areas. It was just a very tough cut of meat to eat, and I ended up having to just eat it off the bone. That was an awkward thing to do, because we are not at a regular barbecue restaurant with paper napkins and peanut shells on the ground. We also had the carrot fuseli and brussels sprouts slaw on the side, and they were both just average.At the end of the day, nothing I had food-wise at The Partisan was special. That was disappointing to me, because I had very high expectations going into this restaurant. What more, we ended up having a long conversation with the people next to us, and they were similarly unimpressed with the food and mocked almost every dish they had (fried chicken, the burger, etc). While the food was not good, we at least gained a few friends!I don really know if I would recommend The Partisan or not. The bar area is gorgeous, and it a fun atmosphere, don get me wrong. But you won be impressed with the food, especially with Rasika literally on the next block -- they are not even in the same field of comparison!, Had an amazing meal at The Partisan during its opening week.... while the wait staff was still a bit shaky and still learning the menu, it didnt detract at all from the delicious offerings and perfect drink pairings. The charcuterie (the restaurants signature) is displayed in a sushi-style menu where you check off what youd like... a very fun and informative way to pick your meat, in addition to it all being delicious! One of the best charcuterie selections in the city, easily. The drink menu is not only super tasty, but really clever - each drink is a reference to a classic punk song, with several drinks having names after The Clash and Bad Brains songs. Wouldnt be surprised if this usually goes over (or under) the heads of the usual clientelle :) Excellent selection of wines as well, and the sommelier was extremely knowledgeable and friendly while helping us make a selection. The beer selection was limited while we were there, but since returning to the bar they now have a large selection of specialty and craft brews on tap.Appetizers and main courses were all delicious, although some portions were a tad small... more than made up for by the wonderful variation in the menu though. Delicious beef fat fries.... goat cheese salad.... aged carpacio.... pork bolognese... could not have been tastier. Ill be back!, Went here after work. Food was decent -- in the category of tasty for a neighborhood restaurant but nothing to go out of your way for. After dropping $200 for 2 people we figured we could enjoy our last drink before catching a cab home. Alas, we were asked to leave unexpectedly. I would have understood if there had been a line,l it people waiting for a table, but there were still tables available. Unfortunately, I can say I will be back., Great food, great atmosphere and great service! The food was impeccable and just when I thought it couldnt get any better the rockfish tartar came out. Its a must have dish. I highly recommend the restaurant if you want superb food for a great price. The vibe brings something different than most restaurants, which makes it fun. The way they have their menu set up, like an index, is super cool and different. Awesome place to check out and leave very satisfied, Around 10:15pm on a Saturday night...We wanted to grab drinks after Wooly Mammoth Theater and were shown to the back bar. With no seats at the bar available, we spotted a spacey 2-top for our party of 4. I asked the host if we could squeeze in there and was advised that it was Well, oh, sort of really a 2-person table and we should just gather seats at the bar. (There were no seats to gather at the bar and no other parties casually standing.)It was bench on one side, so we just added 1 extra chair and got close to our spouses. Then a server brought us a menu! Yay! About the time we thought we might order, we were informed that the bar tables were seated by the host until 11pm. Also, apparently we couldnt stay there if we were only getting a drink. Nevermind that in the meantime we had glanced around and spotted some small plates that might be a nice snack!Overall, lots of miscommunication that could have been avoided if we were told flat out that bar tables are not first-come first-serve. I understand if certain tables cant be seated because theyre considered part of the main dining! But I dont understand why 1/2 of the staff was ready to serve us but 1/2 the staff thought we werent allowed at that table. Not to mention, when I worked in a restaurant, I generally found that a table generating 4 seats of revenue and taking up what you thought was 2 seats of revenue is generally a good thing for the restaurant and my tip.With no other place to go in the restaurant, we headed around the corner for drinks and snacks at Poste! Id go back to try and snag some Red Apron meats, but the style and service at Partisan has me quite turned off., I have been here twice; the day after it opened and then a week later. The space is beautiful, especially the back bar area: dimly lit, romantic, urban, industrial. I really wanted to like this place but its hit or miss. Hits: charcuterie (although the fig rillete was phenomenal the first night, it was so-so the second time); steak tartare; mushroom and kale salad; beef fat fries; beer list and cocktails; the encyclopedic knowledge of the waiter we had the first night; the hostess and management.Misses: brussels sprouts slaw (Partisan if you are reading, please take this off the menu); desserts (all sugar bombs); pork rinds (just average); roasted olives (menu description was misleading, they were just...olives); pork shoulder steak (again, nothing special and bland); the by-the-glass wine prices (if you are charging $15/glass, a wine should be anything other than dull); the cluelessness of the waiter we had the second night.I hope the misses are just start-up hiccups because it could be a special place., I am definitely a fan of this new restaurant in the Penn Quarter. We went before a Caps game and what a great impression they made. They are a meat focused restaurant and are affiliated with the Red Apron Butchery and they adjoin. This means that the food and especially the meat is fresh.The restaurant and bar area are expansive with an edgy industrial feel. Our server was attentive and made great recommendations, the manager even stopped by to check in and I always think that is such a great touch!The Partisan has small and large plate offerings and I recommend a mixture of both because I like to share so I can taste more things.We tried several dishes and they were al delicious. I definitely recommend the Rotissi Fried Chicken - it redefines finger lickingood and the Colonel should be ashamed and the beef jerky. The Snickers Terrine dessert is what pushed this review from 4 to 5 stars!Great food, great service and The Partisan is a great addition to the Penn Quarter., Big ups to this new DC establishment which may cater a bit more to meat lovers but the menu has enough variety with veggies and seafood that even non-meat lovers could leave feeling perfectly full.The atmosphere is perfect for a big group of friends, a quiet date or drinks at the bar. Its got good vibes all around and the servers are super down to earth. The sous chef even came out to our table to ask us how our meal was!We tried just about everything on the menu but heres a rundown of what you should definitely check yes to on your ordering list:Dandelion Salad: the happiest salad. Tasted just like spring! A good starter to balance out the copious amounts of meat we were about to eat.Brussel Sprouts slaw: Perfection.Meatballs with polenta: one large meatball for sharing, on top of a bed of the most heavenly soft and flavorful polenta I ever did see!Spaghetti Bolognese: a classic dish taken to new levels with the flavor of the meat and sauce.Corned Beef Belly: NOM. Smooth and flavorful.Fried Chicken: HOLY fried chicken. No words can describe this fried chicken goodness when it hits your lips. The perfect amount of crispiness to juiciness. Top it off with a tangy sauce with the perfect kick.Beef Fat Fries: you had us at beef fat. These fries were out of control good. Perfect amount of flavor and crispiness.Fried Apple Pie: Just do it. And embrace the explosion of flavors when that bacon caramel gets drizzled on top!, Really excellent food with excellent service. The Partisan hit the ground running when they opened. Menu has good variety (if you like meat) and the prices are quite good for downtown. The service is also very experienced and friendly, suggesting great cocktails and just the right wine pairing for what we went with for meat (bone in ribeye). I also recommend the kale salad, which was delicious.The back bar area is impressively vaulted and the overall vibe cozy and relaxed. It did take a while to adjust to the darkness, which from where I was sitting, actually made reading the menu a bit difficult., Incredible. Great service, wonderful food, intimate atmosphere. The wine menu had a variety of options for all budgets, and the menu itself is just fun. We started with the wild boar pate and lamb with mint pesto from the charcuterie menu, then split an order of shaved radishes. I ordered the braised Spanish octopus and he had the calabrese. Highly recommend. Great date atmosphere. :-), The Partisan deserves 3 Stars. When we walked in we were greeted by the hostess and quickly led to our table. The location of this restaurant is convenient, especially if you are catching a show at E Street Theater or the Verizon Center. The food:Charcuterie - Very good and we particularly enjoyed the house-made mustard, small portions. The rolls things didn taste like anything. Brussel Sprout Slaw- Fine, nothing bright or delicious about it. We just tried a similar dish at Blue Duck Tavern which was far superior for the same price.BBQ Pork Rinds - Very good, spicy and crispy, and an interesting high-end take on something we haven had in agesPork Shoulder - Good green herbed sauce, although slightly over cooked. The portion size seemed small, but the price was 10$. Tri-Tip with Green Pea Mash - Nothing to write home aboutThe service:Our waitress was nice, although awkward and unfamiliar when it came to fielding our questions about the menu. She was good about checking back in on the table to make sure we liked everything and that we had everything that we needed. The wine:The wine menu was solid. We both tried two different reds, which were both good. The Stolpman Sangiovese (spelled incorrectly on menu) seems to stick out in my mind (1 full glass for $10). We felt that the pour for a full glass seemed small. So small that we actually asked our waitress if the pour was only a half glass. I took off a star here. The perception to us (people that know their wine) that the Partisan was nickel and diming customers. The atmosphere:The atmosphere was cozy with a modern/rustic feel. It would be a good place for a date, or for friends to catch up. It wasn very loud, which was good. It was cold the night that we ate here in February, and the glass entry door was constantly opening and closing for customers. It made for an uncomfortably drafty experience, as there was no separation between the hostess/door entry and the tables. We were sitting maybe 10 feet away from the door. The women next to us were actually eating dinner in their coats because of this issue! I considered putting on my coat as well, but I just hate eating in my coat. It was so bad, that I considered asking our waitress if there was something that she could do. A simple curtain, or perhaps using the door of the market next door (after hours), would have solved this problem. Overall:I would return to Partisan, but I didn love it. I wish that they had some cheese to go with their Charcuterie selection. I also wished that the portions were a little larger for the price; something seems wrong when you pay more than $1 per thinly sliced sausage piece., Overall, pleasant!In the beginning the host staff was not very accommodating, but when we were seated we were given two free starters to make up for the back and forth when we arrived. That was much appreciated! FOOD - I am a sucker for prosciutto/jamon so I ordered their house cured prosciutto and it was delicious! They bring it with that hot tender bread of theirs. I also ordered the meatball with polenta. Its a big meatball so its pretty filling. You will need about 2-3 dishes to fill up. We also got the duck fat fries and yeah...duck fat fries are self explanatory. Ridic.Finished with the snickers terrine and WOW. I will say it is super rich so definitely share it with someone, or a few others.Wine is a good price. Great place to go with a group of friends for a dinner for sure. Will be back., Great addition to the Penn Quarter area! Made a reservation for 4 for an 8:30 PM dinner on Friday night. The place has a cool vibe - it attached to Red Apron Butchery next door and has meat hanging from the ceiling. The bar in the back of the restaurant looked interesting, although we didn venture back there. It also unnecessarily dark (I saw some folks using their flashlight on their phone to read the menu).We were quickly seated by the hostess at a comfy booth. Our waiter was very pleasant and gave us some great recommendations. Service overall was prompt. We started with drinks - two of us had the Cool Confusion; their take on a dark and stormy. Very refreshing. I don remember what other people got but everyone liked their (somewhat pricey) drinks.As for the food, we shared:- Beef fat fries: It comes in a rather smallish dish, so the 4 of us polished them off pretty fast. Tasty but not amazing. Ie had better duck fat fries (St. Arnolds.. soooo good).- Rapini + Aged Provolone: Surprisingly great.- Fried Chicken: None of us were excited to get this but I had read another review that raved about it. I glad we ordered it. The half came with 5 pieces. One person thought the sauce (on the side) was too sweet/tangy but everyone really liked the chicken- Bolognese: one person thought the pasta was overdone (it was a bit on the mushy I guess?) but we all thought it tasted excellent.- Beef Tartare: uncooked meat is really not my thing but people liked it- Corned Beef Belly: we all enjoyed this but not our favorite- Triple Stack Burger: Oh yeah. Gooey and very satisfying. My friend said he would come back here just for that burgerOn to dessert (you really should leave room):- Fried Apple Pie: This all made us very happy. We could have licked the plate it was so dang good.- Butterscotch Trifle: A bit lighter, especially compared to the apple pie. Everyone really liked this too though. Big chunks of banana.We left satisfied but not overly stuffed. Most of the serving sizes were adequate. The bill, with tip, came to about $55/person... not horrible by DC standards but I could see it being a lot more expensive if you drink a bunch of cocktails or wine. Saying all that, I definitely look forward to coming back!, Knowing that the Partisan was attached to Red Apron Butchery, it would be really weird to come here and not order charcuterie...so we did. To be more specific, we had the porchetta, the poached fig rillettes, salsiccia and smoked ham. They were served with a spicy mustard. They were all very tasty but the bread served with it didn do anything for me. I have preferred baguette slices. Aside from the food (more on that in a moment), there a lot to love about the Partisan. The decor is so fun - hanging meats, low lighting, actual candles on the table, clipboard-ish menus, the servers actually wearing red aprons - I was crushing on all of it. The rest of our meal was composed of the beef fat fries (with a ranch aioli), fennel + citrus salad, the bucatini and the half fried chicken. Well I mean beef fat is obviously delicious so when you fry potatoes in it, it undoubtedly going to be awesome. And the ranch aioli was lovely--cool, creamy and just the right tang. The fennel + citrus salad was wonderfully bright and reminded me that I should try to use more fennel in my cooking at home. The bucatini was alright -- I didn love it but I didn hate it either. The fried chicken was delightful-- I didn feel too guilty eating it since they don use breading or batter. It was juicy and flavorful. I didn care for the honey hot sauce as it actually was more bitter to the taste for me, however, my dining companion enjoyed it so it could just be me.Our server was very charming and attentive. Most importantly, he didn scoff when I opted not to have any alcohol with my meal. Since I was being one of those people who just got water, I appreciated the lack of judgement/disappointment from him. My dining companion did get a cocktail that she thoroughly enjoyed. We were too full for dessert.Mid-way through our meal, we had serious, serious food envy as we watched the table next to us have the bone-in ribeye delivered to them. It was massive and I was awestruck as I watched the 3 of them destroy it. Well...I guess 75% destroy it as they did have it boxed to go--soo whoever wants to come back with us (because we will of course be back...), let get that., We had been anticipating the opening of this place for a bit and a trip to DC was long overdue...so there was no way we were going to wait long to try this new eatery. As a self-proclaimed foodie, I was totally excited to find a place that had culatello on its menu, let alone a whole charcuterie course with its own check-off menu. The menu can be overwhelming as there are so many dishes to choose from and they all sound divine. We opted for four items from the cured meats menu, a cast iron platter of baked paccheri with bechemel and ricotta, the meatball (nestled in a creamy but textured polenta), the beef fat fries (a MUST) and the tartare. We finished with the amazing snickers terrine and the fried apple pie. Everything was delicious and well worth the wait. We cant say enough about the hospitable and professional staff. Upon hearing of our travels to try their new establishment not only did they welcome us warmly, but they went above and beyond by comping their desserts too. I cant say enough about this place and I highly recommend The Partisan to anyone looking for a great meal in a trendy (but not pretentious) atmosphere., Wow! Where to begin? The entire staff was very welcoming and attentive! Loved our waitress (Susan) who very patiently answered all our questions and made some great recommendations.We started off with the Jerky to munch on while we figured out what to order. The feast then began with a fabulous Charcuterie, moved on to beef fat fries and pork rinds (that were still crackling when brought to the table). The brussel sprout slaw is excellent as was the fennel and citrus salad. The Rotissi-Fried chicken melts off the bone and paired with mashed Yukon Golds makes it a meal to remember! The Triple Stack Burger was delicious and not too spicy.We ended the meal with Fried Apple Pie with bacon caramel drizzel and Snickers terrine which I highly recommend!We will definitely be back!, The food was quite delicious, and it was also great having a big selection of half-glasses of wine. My companion and I got to taste lots of different wines that way.I wouldnt say the food and drinks are *flawless*.But Im still giving a full five stars because of how attentive our server was while we lingered over the meal and had lots of questions about our choices. She really knew the menu well and cared about making sure we got things wed enjoy., Overall, not that pleasant.We live right across the street, and since Red Apron has great coffee, we assumed that the food at the Partisan would be nice. It turned out to be pretty much true. The same cannot be said, however, of the other patrons. Perhaps it was our mistake to come on a Friday around dinner time without making a reservation. Rather than getting a table in the front dining room, we were seated in the back room across from the bar, which was incredibly crowded with what appeared to be several office functions and middle-aged professional happy hours going on. Most of the patrons were doing their very best to speak over the rather loud music that was playing. Ninety minutes later, my ears are still ringing. The server was surprisingly attentive and accommodating, even with the overwhelming crowd. The beer, wine, and cocktail selection was impressive. Thumbs up on both of those points. For food we ordered the three-layer burger, beef fat fries, pickled radish salad (can remember what they call it, exactly), and brussels sprout slaw, all of which were pretty good. Maybe they would have been tastier if the atmosphere had been better. Our meal took a turn for the worse when a gentleman from the party next to us decided to appropriate part of our table as his own personal bar and set his drink down on it. Then his lady friend showed up and proceeded to put her purse and coat down on the table. By this time we were crammed into a corner trying avoid getting elbowed by our neighbors. Our server kindly asked the fine lady to relocate her belongings, but her man pint of beer stayed on the table until we paid the check and left. Not cool at all. But maybe that just DC.Hardly what I woud call a great dining experience, but we might give it another try under somewhat calmer circumstances., I work nearby and LOVE grabbing lunch from Red Apron (the connected posh butcher shop), so when I noticed that they have a hip-looking bar in the back, I could not wait to give it a shot. When we finally got to swing by for drinks one night, we were not disappointed. The space is beautiful, our drinks were good, and our bartender was attentive, friendly, and helpful. When we saw a drunk guy next to us accidentally order a giant platter of meats, our mouths began watering and we vowed to come back for dinner.Fast forward a few weeks, and we found ourselves in Penn Quarter one evening in need of food. We walked in and saw the dining area was full, so we headed to the bar to see if we could just eat there. The bar was full, but one of the 2-seater tables was empty. It not at all clear what the deal is with these tables (are they part of the bar or the restaurant? are they first come first serve? etc), so we stood next to it for a minute to hold it until we managed to stop a passing waiter and ask him. He said the tables are for dining only, and we had to check in with the hostess. No problem! We walked back up to the front, asked the hostess about the table, and she said No problem! Follow me! and lead us back to the table with menus. We were gone for less than a minute, but as we walked back into the bar another couple was helping themselves to the table.They just stole our table, I said aloud. The hostess agreed, but froze like a deer in headlights. This is the point where she should have politely kicked those people out. But she didn. She just muttered something about how people are supposed to ask her but most people don bother. She looked scared and uncomfortable and not sure of what to do. I can get that. I mean, her only job is to make sure that people sit where they are supposed to, but I understand that most people are uncomfortable with confrontation, etc.Just then, some other woman swooped in, I guess to save the day. She seemed to be some sort of manager type I guess. She also should have kicked out the other customers, but instead she told us that another table should open up in about 15 minutes and we could wait at the bar (no we couldn- bar was full- that why we needed a table in the first place). I was ready to just leave, but my boyfriend was dead set on staying, so he gave our name for the wait list and we elbowed ourselves into a crevice near the bar. I assuming this manager person was trying to just keep everyone happy and giving both couples a table seemed like a better overall solution to her than only giving us a table and kicking out other people. I get that. I understand what she was trying to do and can appreciate it.A few minutes pass, and another table frees up. Having seen first hand that these people are not going to bother kicking people out if they snake others for the tables, I decided to not risk it and went to sit down to make sure nobody else wound up stealing it while we waited for them to call us up from the wait list. I sat there patiently while my boyfriend closed his bar tab, and then was suddenly confronted by yet another employee. In the most stereotypically snooty voice ever, he asked me if I was on the wait list for that table. I said yes. He kept eying me suspiciously, then asked what name we had used. I told him I think it was under Mike. Then he said I going to go check if you are REALLY on the wait list for this table. You have GOT to be kidding me. I understand that he needed to check to make sure people weren snaking tables. He didn need to be an arrogant dickwad about it, but it an important part of his job. I get that.Here what I DON get......I don get the complete inconsistency. You can either let the tables be a total free-for-all, or you can enforce your rules. You CANNOT selectively enforce at will. I have never felt so undervalued as a customer as on that night, when I watched the staff both give away our original table and then try to kick us out of our replacement table. It was probably (hopefully) just a temporary breakdown in their communication system, but it an important breakdown that needs to be fixed PRONTO. Plus all of this could be avoided if they just found a way of clarifying the deal with those tables (Ie noticed this issue pop up in other reviews). Just a little card on the table that says For dining customers only- please see hostess. Anyway, despite snooty guy we eventually got to eat. I still giving this place an average rating because our drinks-only visit was good, and our food was seriously delicious. I like that the menu is set up by size of portions, though the inconsistent pricing on some items mystified me. I also really appreciated our waiter, who did a great job of walking us (non-foodies) through the kinda confusing menu without being at all condescending like his coworker. Will give it another shot sometime., Who doesnt like meat and cocktails? You? Then come here and you will certainly change your mind. The very extensive menu might be intimidating, but our waiter was very knowledgeable in helping us pick our choices. Known for their meats, dont come here if youre looking for a lot a variety. They do meats well and so this is what you should concentrate on. Select a bunch of house cured meats - I recommend the liverwurst and the bacon. Try a sausage or two. Then meats!Squab, yum. Rib eye, yum. I wish we could order more, like the Pigs Head or the porterhouse (?), but there was only 2 of us. The dessert wasnt all that amazing, but the cocktails were. Will def try again, hopefully with more people., First off... Neighborhood Restaurant group- you are on FIRE! As soon as I walked in to The Partisan, I felt a connection. This place exudes a cool and comfortable yet trendy (without trying too hard) vibe. The back bar area is really where its at.The exposed brick and high ceilings, ample bar space and table seating are perfectly laid out. I struck up a converation with Syed, the bartender, and thats when I learned that this location is part of the group that has brought us EatBar, Tallulahs, Churchkey, Birch & Barley, Rustico and most recently the Blue Jacket... all favorites. Second off, Syed clearly knows the product... both food and wine. He suggested a delightful Sauvignon Blanc and walked my friend and I through a fun, small plate-style menu. His recommendations were right on point. We had the meatball, the roasted mushroom & kale salad (amazing) and fussili. I will definitely need to try the foie gras when I go back and save room for what looks like an incredible dessert menu. I switched from white wine to red and after an amaterish description of what I was seeking, Syed poured up EXACTLY what I was looking for (there are a TON of wines on tap and a nice variety of craft beer.)This place has only been open for 3 months or so but theyve clearly got things figured out. It is a great spot for happy hour, date night or just a night out with friends., Ha, the owners of this place think theye slick...talking about Partisan when it all about the artisan behind the bar and in the kitchen or in the butcher shop next door. This place is amazing. Dark simplicities speak volumes to what you might expect but until you order a drink youe not quite sure what youe getting into. The bartenders take pride in their mixes and it shows. Couple that with the menus and their endless possibilities. From the charcuterie to entrees to dessert the Partisan makes and serves everything in an artful manner. I can recall another place where I didn want to stop eating and tasting and talking in such an incredibly rich space.Welcome to the art of eating good food in it purest forms..., I dream about the food here. While the menu is so extensive it is almost overwhelming, the food itself is fantastic. Your kind and patient waiter will help you navigate through the charcuterie menu, and youd leave happy and satisfied even if you just stick to that. The bread that accompanies the meats is so light and buttery--we definitely ordered five rounds of it (no shame) for the table. The drink list is standard of what youd see around here, but come here for the meats. Now., Double cut pork loin and belly = total heaven if you appreciate the fat on meats. They say its for 2 but unless youre famished it can probably feed 3. Definitely get some red wine to cut the fat in your mouth. I told myself I wasnt going to order drinks that night and it was a total mistake. Glad my friend convinced me to try it with some wine. Excellent service even during a busy after-work hour. Ill be back for sure., Amazing selection of meat dishes from the attached butchers. Had an incredible meal from start to finish. Cant say enough about this place., Very creative cocktails and delicious fries, with rosemary and garlic cloves. A fun place for happy hour or a date. It is tight quarters by the bar, so prepare to get cozy with your neighbors and your waiter (ours was a bit awkward)., Fantastic! Anytime I go to a trendy new place in DC, Im always afraid Im going to leave feeling ripped off or just disappointed. Thankfully this place lived up to the hype. My wife and I each had a couple rounds of drinks, ordered a charcuterie platter, the cheese platter, the fries, and had dessert. Our server Matthew was great & was very knowledgable about the menu. We left well satisfied for $100 before tip. Pricey? Yes. Worth it? Yes., So after a failed date night at Menu around the corner - bland city - my boyfriend and I wanted a redo - so we made reservations the next night at Partisan. Its funny b/c theyre very similar to one another - they both have the Bar, Market, Kitchen thing going for them - just one major difference... Partisan is superior in every way. While both their decors are great, Partisan is much more intimate, something I find rare in DC. Now where they really differ is the food and beverage. Partisan is absolutely delicious. There wasnt a thing that we ordered that we didnt like and it being more of a small plate place we ordered a wide variety. The service here was also stellar. Attentive but not over-eager (like at Menu). They did had all of our plates come out at once and I made a small comment to our server about it and he apologized and offered to have the kitchen remake the larger plates. We said not to worry - but at the end of the meal he brought us out an extra dessert (we were sharing) to make up for it. I dont know about you, but you get brownie points in my book for that kind of service. Not everywhere cares to not only apologize for the mistake but try to make your experience better b/c of it. To say the least, well be returning customers!, Delicious charcuterie meats, beef fat fries, and burger! Dessert must haves: snickers cheesecake and fried apple pie a la mode, The food options are not very healthy. Also, I felt a little overwhelmed by the strange touches added to each dish. Each option had some strange added element that didnt really seem to work with the overall flavor of the dish. The burger that my date had was delicious, but incredibly greasy. I felt kind of gross after eating it. The dessert was the high point of the meal, a ginger beer float with fernet branca ice cream. Id go there just for that, but forgo the meal., best choice - the beef fat fries and and charcuterie were to die for. good service and tasty cocktails on july 4th in the nations capital. fit for foodies, Another winner from the Neighborhood Restaurant Group/Red Apron folks. I dig the dark atmosphere in this former hardware store. They have 18 drafts, mostly obscure out of town offerings like Quebec Brasserie Dieu du Ciel Rose dibiscus and Belgium Brasserie de la Senne Band of Brothers, but also including DC Brau On the Wings of Armageddon.This is not the place to take your vegetarian friends. As you expect from Red Apron, the temple of nose to tail sausage making, their charcuterie is excellent. The charcuterie menu is broken down into seven categories: bright, herbal and floral, spicy hot, smoky, spiced, rich and smooth, and earthy. I sat at the bar and ordered two from the herbal and floral category: porchetta de testa (made from the head of the pig with rosemary, thyme, and fennel pollen), and the thin-shaved lamb leg with mint pesto. I followed that with an order of crispy nettles, shallots and ramps, and finished up with the squid ink bucatini.The meat products definitely shine here, and it makes a great fit for a space that a little off the beaten path. Worth your time and effort., A very sneaky batman overcharges on a couple of drinks. One I get, three is no good. The food we very average. The Brussels sprouts were awful and the scallop, yes just one, was undercooked and cold when served. A lovely hostess so she gets the star. Wont be back, Interesting cocktails, good wine list, great charcuterie (try the culatello), interesting sides. Service was friendly. One complaint was that they tend to go too heavy on the salt with things that shouldnt need too much (steak). Also the dessert list looked way too rich - how about a nice sorbet after three courses of meat?, The food here is excellent! I HIGHLY recommend the roasted mushroom and kale salad and the toasted fennel sausage. The salad is probably the best Ive ever had!, Great bar! Can speak to the full-blown restaurant because we only came here for drinks and snacks, but loved it, with a few caveats.First, the decor is very modern/industrial. It classy but not stuffy. The bar area is set in the back, and the restaurant is actually a bit smaller than I would have thought.Anyway, on to the drinks! The Amari on tap was... interesting. It a strange mixture of intensely bitter, herbal, and sweet. Plus it quite potent. Like a less jarring version of Fernet Branca. They have 2 cellos (think Limoncello but not) on tap too: when we went it was kafir lime and pomegranate. Finally, they have a score of wines on tap too! Cool idea, and the bartender kindly let us try a bunch before we ordered (amazing service!)-- I was not a huge fan of their reds, most of which I found to be way too young and underdeveloped (like pinots, even when they weren). That said, The Rule (Napa Cab) was a solid fall back.We also ordered charcuterie: the tete de pho (head cheese with Thai spices), culatello (their version of prosciutto, which the bartender comped us because he wanted us to try it; again, such awesome service!!), the foie gras and truffle bologna, sopressata (spicy classic), and lardo (pure fat!). Loved the tete de pho, which tastes like Thai-inspired pate. Loved the culatello (it prosciutto) and the sopressata (so classic). The lardo was interesting and came out basically fried - different from how Ie had t before, but good! And the bologna... I wanted it to be good, and love truffle and foie gras, but it just tasted like bologna. I would pass.All in all, a fun, great place!, The charcuterie was very good, especially the Red Menace. We also really enjoyed the carrot fusilli and the squid ink bucatini, although there is only one clam. The quail was good, but seemed a bit expensive relative to the portion, so I would probably try something else if we went back. Skip the brussel sprout slaw, it is really bland. Im not usually a dessert person, but the fried apple pie with bacon carmel was really great. The drink menu was very good, with some great beers on tap and interesting cocktails. The pour on the half glass of wine was also surprisingly generous. The back room where the bar is has a great atmosphere. If we went back wed probably sit back there., We checked out The Partisan for happy hour this week. We promised to order food as well as drinks so they gave us a table near the bar. They have a good selection of small plates which we shared. The highlights were the brussels sprouts, fries, and rockfish tartar. They also have a great selection of cocktails, beers, and wine., Came here on a trip to DC and was blown away by the menu! We started out with a great charcuterie board and a beer from their very solid beer selection. Our waiter then made some great recommendations and we tried a bunch of the small plates including scallops, beef tartar, and mushroom and kale salad. Then to close out the dinner we ordered massive pig head which you can pick clean! It was a meat lovers dream. Compliments to the chef!, I was looking to impress some out of town guests and this place really provided the Wow factor I was looking for. Beginning with the bartender, who mixed off menu concoctions based solely upon a favorite classic. Something very different yet strangely familiar. The food was great. The charcuterie, the Fred Flintstone sized pork chop, and the atmosphere made for a very enjoyable evening, This place makes me feel bad for vegetarians. The charcuterie and squid ink bucatini are highlights. So is the compressed melon salad - perfect for the hot muggy days of summer., As a diner who doesnt eat mammals, I wasnt sure if this place would be my proverbial cup of tea, but clearly I was mistaken. First, I love the location of the bar. Its in the back of the restaurant rather than the front, giving it a more intimate and special feel. Also, the bar has a ton of standing room, so even if you cant secure a chair, you arent in the way of servers, patrons, etc (a la Oyamel - the worst bar layout ever). The cocktails are pretty creative, and Im pleased with the newish popularity of speakeasy-quality drinks without the pomp and circumstance of the more established liquor bars. While our reservation was at 8:30PM, we werent actually seated until 9:15PM. Normally Id dock a star for a restaurants inability to manage reservations and table turnover, but the manager totally made it up to us (and our neighboring table) with multiple complimentary apps and a personal apology, which was way more than necessary. The menu is laid out smartly, which a small picture of the lead protein at the bottom of each individual page. This made it easy for me to identify the vegetable, chicken, and fish dishes. I tried the kale salad and one of the small fish dishes (I cant remember which one), and while both were excellent, the salad was so much better than expected. Im not sure if the green that I got was actually kale, but the portion was large, and each bite packed a lot of flavor and texture. Overall, Id gladly return for a drink or for a meal, and I wish this place tons of future success., The food, ambiance, and the crowd are wonderful. This used to be my weekly hangout with friends. This week there were eight of us there in the bar section ordering drinks and food. Three of our friends decided to leave so we settled the old bill which was close to $500 and started a new tab. The waiter asked the remaining five of us to move to a table for two even though we ordered more drinks. He told us the manager wanted us to move. After we protested, the waiter offered us a weak apology and let us stay. The manager avoided us altogether- no apology. I can understand if we were occupying a table for hours and not ordering food or drinks. The whole episode didnt sit well with us and prompted me to write this review. Well be moving out weekly happy hour to an establishment that appreciates our business. Too bad for poor management., The food, mainly the cutlery, was great. But thats where it stops. If you want to feel like you dont know anything about food or drinks, when in fact you do, then this is the place for you. You can explain the unique food and drinks you provide sans the judgment. It seems the staff is far from interested in educating or making sure you have a good time., Had an awesome meal last friday night, after some jazz in the garden. Service was wonderful, our waiter made great recommendations and was super friendly. We started out with some tasty charcuterie. Our waiter suggested one of the pates, which I was very pleasantly surprised with (neither of us are into pates). For dinner/our main entrees we ended up sharing some small plates (radishes & sugar snap peas, summer bean salad, meatball, 120 day aged carpaccio), along with the 21 day dry aged rohan duck. The duck was beautifully prepared and came out whole before it was carved up, lovely golden brown. It was also served with the most amazing pea shouts. The meatball was also a stand out. Im not a fan of radishes, so thats not something Id pick again (but based more on personal preference than quality of the dish). Id highly recommend for a special night out or happy hour. They have a great beer selection and very chill bar area. For sure Ill be back., Came to this place for the first time on Monday with a group of friends, a few of which were in from out of town. It was all of our first time there - a coworker recommended it. We really wanted to show our out of town friends a great time, and our server Jurgen made sure we did! Our drinks were always full, he was super knowledgable about the menue and suggested great food and he was absolutely hilarious (and easy on the eyes)! The ambiance, drinks and snacks were all great. I will definitely be back and will tell others! I work in the area and have been looking for a new happy hour spot - I think I just found it!, Super over priced considering the portion sizes. Maybe its because of the ingredients theyre using but the food wasnt worth it. The large size burger got a big thumbs down because instead of one juicy meat-filled party it has 2 very thin patties that had way too much cartilage. On the plus side the place is gorgeous inside, the womens restroom doorknobs are amazing! And the squid ink pasta was delicious, but again, tiny portion size., I went to Partisan on 8/8/14 to celebrate a friends birthday. I want to thank our waiter for all of his suggestions and accommodations. The pre dinner cocktails the bartender recommended were also delicious. Although the service was good to exceptional I was not a huge fan of this restaurant. It is very dark making it almost impossible to see the menu. I also thought the prices were a little on the high side considering we were ordering tapas. It felt like a place where I was paying for their rent and not the food. The exception to this feeling was the dessert which was excellent. In my opinion this is a great place to get together for drinks (it is very conveniently located) but my palate was not a fan of the food (except for the dessert) based on the size of the entrees and price., Service at the bar may be a little slow, but its worth the wait. They usually have at least a few sours on tap, and you cant go wrong with the charcuterie (especially if theyre offering a pairing!). No arguments with the music selection either., This is a new bar that has the feel of a classic DC bar thats been there forever. It has that old time bar feel with dim lighting and a gigantic bar that makes it easy to get a seat as long as youre there early. If you get there after 6, this place can get CROWDED. Unlike an old bar, theres no weird stickiness or odd smells so thats a plus.The bartenders are friendly and know their stuff, be sure to ask for their happy hour cocktail menu to get the best deals on some tasty and creative drinks. They also have a decent beer selection and offer a tasting price if you want to sample before you commit to a pint. As everyone mentions, the charcuterie is expensive but worth a try at least once. You can add a variety of meats which are fresh made at their butcher shop next door. The Spanish Chorizo and the roasted garlic + smoked pepper were especially interesting but they have quite the lineup. This place can be on the expensive side, especially if you stray from the happy hour menu, but its worth a try and a worthy addition to the DC bar landscape., My table must have been Baghdad , because the chef was dropping crazy flavor bombs on us!Whole pig head done! Rabbit squash blossoms hold up!!Plate of 6 different incredible meats !! Cray cray food heaven Dont forget the cocktails! Drink a few to many..... yolo!, Went with a chef friend who had high hopes and we were both pretty disappointed in the food at Partisan. The drink selection is great and I really enjoyed their Lost In The Supermarket cocktail. Service was also decent. We started with a selection of charcuterie that included Red Menace and a few others, none of which were very memorable. The cuisine itself was lacking big time. The Roasted Pig Head was a novelty at best, with barely enough meat to serve a single person, and covered in chunks of fat. Scary considering the price. The Bone-In Ribeye was backyard barbecue quality, nowhere near good enough to justify the price. The other items we ordered were not good enough to recall. I would only recommend Partisan for drinks., My husband I and dined at the Partisan tonight for date night. Overall, the restaurant was fine, though I wouldnt go out of my way to come back.The good:The atmosphere is cozy and trendy. Good for a date.The menu is inventive. Its broken up into different meats and veg, so you get a pork section, a beef section, a fish section, etc. Pretty nifty if you ask me.The cocktails were great. I got the Sailin On, which was creative and delicious. The wine list was good, too.The meatball, cod fries and arugula salad were awesome. Especially that meatball. We got the Snickers Terrine for dessert, which involved peanut butter and chocolate. If thats wrong, I dont want to be right.The bad:Not the restaurants fault, but the table next to us was obnoxiously loud. I did learn someone in DC got a vasectomy after impregnating a girl twice. Watch out ladies.The service was slow. We waited for a good 10 minutes before our order was taken. Probably because out waiter was dealing with Mr. Vasectomy next door, so I tried to cut him a little slack, but still.One of the dishes, the Bavette, was unpalatable. I am surprised when I find a dish I just cant eat. Bottom line: I wouldnt suggest the restaurant but Id come back again with friends. Their drink list was awesome and the cheese plate looked good, so what else do you really need?, I think the small plate works great. and Good pricing. however I find the charcuterie portion very small. at 5-7 usd per meat, some meat you basically gets what looks like 1 slice or something. maybe about an ounce worth of it. and besides the waffle-looking thing and mustard, theres no pickle or nothing that usually comes with charcuterie. I would come back here for the small plate but would not order anything from the charcuterie side of the restaurant., We got our table early which was nice and what not but the food was nothing fantastic at all and the wine selection was almost too much. Our server was great and the atmosphere was nice but I cant find a reason to go back. Nothing special., We were very excited to try this place. The atmosphere is cool, all the menu descriptions sound amazing BUT once you try them, you wonder where are the flavors you were expecting? Dishes are only ok... not bad, but not amazing, which is what we expect in this price range., We love love love Partisan! It seems like DC restaurants with innovative cocktails, great beer lists, and quirky food get overrun and/or snooty too quickly; weve stopped going to some former faves because we didnt want a bunch of drama from the hosts. We have never had drama at Partisan, we get great food and drink for the price point, and we arent rushed. I recommend: asking your waiter for food reccs, beer reccs and pairings. Every server/host we have ever interacted with has been really knowledgeable about the current list and menu. They wont just suggest the same things they have in the beer aisle at Whole Foods (although recently after trying a seasonal beer at Partisan, we DID see two boxes of it at Whole Foods, and bought four bottles). I see that another reviewer said the wine selection was almost too much; if you prefer a narrowly curated slate of options or prix fixe type menu, you might not like Partisan. It can take a while to decide what to order. :)On the food side, I am a fan of the mushroom and kale salad, baked paccheri, and for dessert, fried apple pie or fernet float. Some things (like the Lardo) you may not enjoy if you are not a big fan of meat, and I wouldnt bring vegetarian friends here for food. After all, there is bacon (fully disclosed on menu!) on the apple pie. (yum).Ok, after writing this review I want to hop on the metro and go to Partisan for dinner. I think this is our favorite place right now -- I hope it doesnt change., What a fun place. Food was amazing, we had the beef fat fries, the chicken and a squash dish. Each one was wonderful. Wait staff was friendly, place was relaxed, no rushing you here. But the highlight was the pear sorbet and fried apple pie, wow!
72|the-red-hen-washington|This was a nice place to have a date. Just opened today. Very friendly staff. Beautiful location. I enjoyed my pasta and my girlfriend enjoyed her scallops. But the servings were pretty small and the sides were expensive enough that having both would have made the meal substantially more expensive.Ill be back, Im sure, when I have guests in the neighborhood who want a nice sit down dinner. I will probably not go back all that often of my own accord, though., We went for opening night and were extremely impressed. Food, drink, service and ambiance were all excellent. My partner got the scallop/squid dish. It had a delicious, smoky aioli. I had the homemade rigatoni with fennel sausage (all their pastas are homemade). Also excellent. Our only disappointment was the portion sizes which are quite small. I notice from the other reviews that we are not the only ones to make this comment. Dessert was a pine nut tart which had a fresh honey taste to it. There was also an original tapenade served with the bread which was a very nice touch. We are very excited to have Red Hen in Bloomingdale and expect it to quickly become one of DCs top restaurants., I ate at the Red Hen last night for the first time. I went in a group of four so we had the chance to order five appetizers, four entrees and two desserts; therefore I had a chance to try a lot of their food. First, the bad...- The dishes are on the smallish sides (but realistically, we Americans have probably become accustomed to way oversized portions)- It is a little bit loud for my taste... which is far outweighed by the good...- EVERYTHING tasted good. We truly enjoyed every dish. The food had a light, intriguing and deeply enjoyable quality. - The service was excellent. The people who run the Red Hen are clearly pros in the business. This was their third night open and it ran like it was there for years. The service people were nice, attentive and we were never without a want or need.- The ambience is simple but elegant. It is a big open space with lots of real hard wood and the place has that great aroma of a nice camp fire since they use a wood burning stove. - I thought the prices were extremely reasonable. Were not huge drinkers and only one of us had a glass of wine. That said, the bill came out to only $144 for four in a really DC restaurant. While the dishes were smallish, we certainly were full and didnt actually spend that much so my first point may be mute. Recommendations:While I understand the menu will change quite often, the following really struck a chord for the group:- The grilled beef tongue was awesome. It was the closet youll get to foie gras without torturing a poor duck.- The roasted scallops was, in my opinion, the best thing anyone ordered. It made me not miss Cafe Atlantico as much (it was served with baby kale, smoked aioli and... drum roll... squid ink!)- The Gnoochi was was smooth and earthy- I ordered the Hen. I supposed looking at that painted Red Hen over the past few weeks made me want to chop a Hens head off and eat it. It was rich and paired with an excellent mix of vegetables which werent just thrown on the side, but placed under the Hen in a way that made the tastes all flow together. - The cream soda and chocolate gelato managed to be light and rich at the same time--really, really good stuff.I could potentially up this to five stars in the future--but I need to eat there a few more times and put my feelings in perspective., We just ate at Red Hen and are very excited to have a restaurant like this in the neighborhood.The d39cor is great, and the restaurant has a great ambiance. It would be a great place for a date, or with a group, however we went for an early meal with our two young children. We arrived at about 5.30pm on a Friday and it was not busy, but by the time we left at 7pm it had filled up. The service was particularly attentive (before it got busy perhaps a little too much hovering e.g. water was filled up again practically before I even put my glass down) and friendly. I had the scallops which was delicious - served with squid and spinach. My husband had the lamb sandwich which he enjoyed. They don have a children menu so we asked if they could do some pasta with a red sauce or with butter and cheese and they offered the latter so my 3 year old had a small plate of plain pasta with a little butter and parmesan which he devoured in a matter of minutes and then said he was still hungry. Unlike other reviewers, the portion size for our entrees (scallops and lamb sandwich) was reasonable to large and we were pretty full but still managed to order a tasty pine nut tart (delicious).The negative part -- when we got the bill they charged us $15 for the plain pasta with cheese for my 3 year old. FIFTEEN DOLLARS! Apparently the bowl that he ate was full size even though he small for his age and ate it in less than 5 minutes and then filled up on bread because he was still hungry. We eat out a lot with our kids and most restaurants are happy to make a plate of pasta for a three year old even if it not on the menu and typically charge $5-8 to do so. Up to $10 and I wouldn have blinked but $15 was practically the same price as the lamb sandwich. We had such a lovely meal - food was great, service nice, ambiance good, children well behaved - but I have to admit I felt ripped off when I saw this charge and it impacted my overall impression. I raised it with the waitress who admitted that they were still working things out and that she would pass on our feedback to the chef but didn reduce the bill.Bottom line, wel probably go back but not with the kids. (Unlike other restaurants in the neighborhood it not somewhere we take them regularly anyway because it fancier and more expensive than Rustik, for example, but they need to work this out if they want to appeal to the rapidly growing number of families in Bloomingdale)., I went on their third night and it was quite packed. I have to say that the interior decor is just pure class - theyve done a fantastic job with it. I guess thats to be expected from the talented team at Edit. Anyway, now for the food. The menu is definitely interesting and the portions are definitely on the small side of things, but that really didnt bother me. I had the smoked trout crostini for an appetizer and it was quite flavorful but way too salty. The caviar (?) sprinkling just made it worse. For the mains, I had the scallops and calamari, which was excellent - very smoky with a great texture to the sauce. However, there wasnt a carb to go with the dish. I had to ask for some bread to bring it all together. The semolina almond cake with the lemon butter and ice-cream that I had was good, very good for the most part, but the cake to ice-cream proportions were off. Semolina based cake is a bit dry and you need the ice-cream to go with it. Given that it was third day, Ill give them 4 stars. I plan on visiting them again in a few weeks and will update the ratings. Ohh..I thought the wine list was quite eclectic and well priced. I spent some time in Burgundy last year visiting vineyards, and it was nice to see quite a few familiar ones, including a chardonnay from Saint-Veranz (a must have on a sunny afternoon)., This is a great place to share a bottle of wine and light, flavorful small plates. The chocolate budino dessert was also outstanding. Beyond the food, Im really impressed with the transformation of this space. The room is gorgeous, with impeccable touches throughout. I highly recommend for a nice date night out, or for drinks at the bar., The ambiance, service, decor, etc. was fantastic, and that alone would warrant repeat visits. (We are also Bloomingdale residents and thrilled to support a good place in our neighborhood). That said, while the food was good, Im not sure it quite matched the price point. There were a few stand out dishes - the rigatoni was great, and the swordfish. Ill definitely be back, though. Thanks for coming to the neighborhood Red Hen!, The portions were definitely on the small side. I got this dish that was there take on Mac and cheese. It tasted like pasta with parmigian and pepper. Nothing special by any means. The design of the place was spot on. Very nice and cozy. My friend who was with me had to order three entrees and an app to feel full. I had high hopes but wont be going back any time soon., Some things were delicious. Some things were okay. I suggest getting the hot dishes because the salad dishes we ordered were fine - but nothing to rave about. The gnocchi and fish were fantastic though. The restaurant is very well decorated and comfortable. I also love the bar set up. It makes it so that the restaurant can get really busy but you still have space so you dont notice., Beauitfully designed space and really fantatsic warm service - perhaps some of the best I have had in the Distrcit for any memorable period of time. I concur with the previous posts about the small portion size. The wines by the galss were 5 oz pours, a slight improvement over many places in the District that have shifted to 4 oz. pours. The salads and appetizers lacked finesse and left one with the lingering feeling that something was missing. The rigatoni was a standout but the portion was far too small for the price point; we were three and shared the pasta but the pickings were pretty slim. I appreciated the gluten free offering of the pasta. The grilled hen was pretty good but, again, felt, that something else could have been added to enhance the flavor. The swordfish portion was as small as the lamb sandwich was generous. I really was hoping for more of a neighborhood place that provided a direct correlation of high quality food with value. I left hungry but with a reasonably good impression of the place, particularly the service., I dont usually write reviews. I love perusing through reviews of my favourite spots (and not so favourites) to see if I agree, blah blah blah, but have never written a review of my own. Until now. I have to say that I was extremely impressed with The Red Hen. I usually give a restaurant a chance to find its rhythm before I patron, as new restaurants need a bit of time to start moving like a well oiled machine, but a week in, The Red Hen knows whats up. The inclusive feel created by an open kitchen works well managing to not be intrusive to the dining area. The staff are friendly and the owner is mingling saying hello and getting to know the patrons. I was not surprised to hear that Sebastian worked with Ashok Bajaj, as thats his way too.. always mingling, always personable. I ate at the bar and only sampled two items, as it was my first visit and had to be on my way. The prosciutto crostini was delectable, the prosciutto almost like butter. The rigatoni with fennel sausage ragu was also wonderful and I found the portion size just right. Not the gluttonous American portions expected by most. All in all, I can say Ill be a regular and coming back often. Lucky me, its in walking distance. Welcome to Bloomingdale! Were so glad to have you., I am so excited that this neighborhood restaurant is open. The decor is warm and cozy, with interesting touches of color and class everywhere you turn. The staff and servers are nice, welcoming and very knowledgeable. Plus its nice to see friends and neighbors pack the place every night.Ive been a few times now for dinner and to sit at the bar for drinks. When dining with a group of 4, we got to sample a lot of the menu, eating and drinking through the night, leaving full and happy. For a lighter meal with my Mom we split 1 app, 1 entree and a dessert -perfect for late night dining.My favorite cocktail is the bourbon with prosecco and the orange wine is delightful- you should definitely try it. Sitting at the bar you get a better view of the open kitchen- which is super fun to watch. But every seat in the house is great- and comfy.While Ive sampled a variety of things on the menu, all delicious, the following were my favorites:-the smoky ricotta crostini is peppery and light-the prosciutto crostini with fig jam and tallegio is outstanding and so well balanced-the gnocchi with pesto are to die for! So light and fluffy covered in pesto with hazelnuts- a nice touch-the woodgrilled hen is so moist and falls of the bone. a great namesake-all the desserts are wonderful- but the semonlina lemon cake and buddino are my favoritesYou can make a reservation or walk in and try to grab a table. Its been busy and reservation are hard to come by, which is great for business, but if you go early or late- youll be fine. Im glad to see the newest place doing so well. Looking forward to whatever is in store- I hear rumors of brunch and eventually- outdoor seating., Came in on Sunday at 530pm and snagged the last two seats at the bar. We ordered the warm olives with pancetta and fennel, the crostini with ricotta and honey, the clams casino, and the gnocchi with hazelnut pesto. I have to say that they were all tasty and i would order them again. The food was fresh and well prepared. The service was professional and both bartender girls were very nice. The open kitchen was pleasant to look at and the open fire grills added a nice warmth to the ambiance. Great space and design. Overall good experience, Since writing my first review Ive been back twice and Ive been really pleased both visits. One time sitting at the bar with a friend-- the service wasnt quite as good as my first time (different server who didnt seem as experienced and interested in making sure we were well tended to), but I enjoyed the food and wine more. The beef tongue was amazing, and they seem to be revising their wine by the glass list, which is nice. I loved the rose! Then I sat down for dinner with two friends last night at a table by a window and had a wonderful meal and fantastic service. We shared the smoked trout appetizer (delicious) and I had the black linguini which was wonderful. I loved that the portion wasnt too big-- perfect size in my opinion-- and I thought it was fairly priced for the quality of the ingredients. We also shared the escarole (spicy and delicious) and the smoked olive salad (still love those smoked olives). The pine nut tart with creme fra3eche gelato was one of the best deserts Ive had in a long time. The sourness of the creme fra3eche was perfect with the mildly sweet tart. To drink I had more rose and then we shared a lovely bottle of reasonably priced red.Keep up the great work, Red Hen, and Ill see you again real soon!, Consistently great food, clever cocktails and skillful service. If you are walking in without a reservation, a one-hour wait is not unusual. But thats common at every restaurant thats doing such good things. So if you expect that, and plan for it, you will be happy., The Red Hen isn my favorite restaurant in the city or did it serve up the best meal Ie ever had, but it still deserves my five-star recommendation because it made me leave with a big smile on my face. And while some of that may be attributed to a nice time with great friends (or the several drinks I had consumed throughout the evening), the Red Hen definitely contributed to my overall happiness and enjoyment that evening.As Bloomingdale continues to bloom (see what I did there?), more and more restaurants are beginning to pop up as blocks slowly gentrify and the area begins to step into its up-and-coming neighborhood status. And the Red Hen is just another step on the road, with a spacious dining floor layout and open kitchen that feels welcoming the moment you step inside. And with friendly service, youe already well on your way to a good evening without having taken your first bite of food.But getting to that, I would say that my overall impression was of pleasant surprise. The food was really good! I don know why I was a bit surprised though...maybe because so many DC restaurants now serve average food at above average prices that when a place like Red Hen puts delicious food at fair prices, you are required to do a little double take. While our group of five each ordered several dishes, I would say a few definitely stood out. For me, the favorites were: the beef tongue, which was perfectly tender topped with a slightly tart dressing mixed with toasted pine nuts and cauliflower; the black linguine with clams, which provided just enough kick to match the flavor of the squid ink and seafood; and the semolina almond cake with the lemon butter and ice-cream, which flawlessly melds tart and sweet together.Granted it a bit out of the way for some DC residents (me especially), I can still see myself making the trek to Red Hen every once in a while to just enjoy their company and dine on some pretty good eating., I cant get enough of The Red Hen, and know its going to become a huge neighborhood draw, just like Boundary Stone and Big Bear already are.The windows in this place are enough for me to get gitty. Really, so much light pours into The Red Hen in daylight hours, that it adds for some amazing ambiance.Along with the light pouring in, there are really cool exposed wooden beams and shelves throughout the place. You feel like youre in a rustic barn, about to be served a chilly glass filled with a fresh cocktail. And youd be close to right.We went the first weekend they opened, and I cant say enough about the early training of the staff. With any place, staff takes time to get acquainted with the restaurant and the menu, but the bumps were so minimal here, that you can tell the managers took time to go after high quality folks.Everyone was incredibly pleasant and helpful, that I cant stop oozing my love for TRH.Their cocktail list is quite delightful, too. They are reasonably priced, all around $8, and arent just your run-of-the-mill offerings. They marry some your favorite staple liquors, with unique herbal and fruity mixes that give it a fresh Italian flare. The wine list, unsurprisingly, is also quite large. Not being a huge wine snob, I was happy with the offerings by the glass, which can be pretty scarce on a lot of menus.We started off orders a few of the crustinis. We had the smoked trout as well as the smoked ricotta with brown butter and truffled honey. What a start!Going all-in for a carb-centric meal, next came the gratis bread plate. Served with a bit of pesto, this alone is a perfect start to your meal, no matter what choices you made.After starting the deep dive into a food coma, we perused the drink menu some more. One thing that stood out was their unique offering of Italian beers. Not just the typical Peroni or Moretti, but some really unique ones that Im not used to seeing much of anywhere in the city.We went for the Italian blonde, served in true wine country style, in a 750ml bottle, it was quite the compliment to our main courses arriving.I went with the roasted scallops and calamari in squid ink and was generally pretty impressed. I always like when I can eat Italian food that gets off the path of typical pasta and pizza. While I love those things in their own respects, its always enjoyable to have some options.My dining partner went for the hen, which he was very impressed with also.As much as dessert was calling me, I stopped myself, knowing that I wouldnt be able to get up if I had done so.Another highlight is that they take online reservations and started doing so right at launch. Too often, restaurants dont offer online reservations at start, so its first come, first serve. Online reservations just make life for everyone easier. Theyre on City Eats.I cant wait to see what more is to come!, We arrived at 7 pm and were told wed have a one hour wait. 9:15 pm rolls by and we are still at the bar two and a quarter hours later. During that time, bartender was too busy to make time for me, I waited half an hour just to order a glass of wine. We ordered food well after 9 pm. Food was very average. Scallops had a Chinese style sauce - scallops themselves were ok and sauce could be better in Chinatown. Pasta, I wondered, was it something from a box? It was definitely al-dente, and a basic tomato-cheese sauce. Chicken was ok but lots of fat and bone. All in all, over-priced for the quality of service, wait time, and lackluster food. Ambiance - a ok. Bathrooms not acceptable. Only ONE each for men and one for women. Are you transitioning, and need a gender neutral? Sorry, its the usual binary male/female, no other options. I had a wonderful time with my friends - company with whom I chose to dine was great. But restaurant - keep looking for a better place!, I went to dinner at the Red Hen on a Friday night and we arrived without a reservation around 7pm. The menu is Italian inspired using mid-Atlantic ingredients. We were told it was going to be an hour wait, but we waited for a half an hour and a table opened up. We had started off with a nice glass of rose at $7 a glass. We ordered the smoked trout appetizer on grilled bread. The appetizer came with two pieces...perfect for my dining companion and I to split. We ordered the hen and the scallops to split from entrees. Both dishes were excellent and the grilled hen was perfectly cooked. We asked for extra bread to sop up the delicious squid ink sauce (scallop dish).We ordered the semolina almond cake with the lemon butter and vanilla gelato. Wow, at first I thought we were ordering a simple (maybe boring dish). The cake was lovely and packed with flavor. The texture was soft, yet crunchy and crumbly challenging my taste buds. I loved all the lemon in the dessert.Ill will definitely be coming back to try the homemade pastas!, Outstanding early dinner today! All four of us loved all courses - we had two salads (absolutely delicious) two hen dishes and two lamb sandwiches. All loved the meals as well as a bottle of very good and reasonably priced San Genovese (not sure of spelling). We shared a lemon cake with vanilla gelato dessert, which was also outstanding., I do want to say that my Scallops were amazing, but the odd tasting cocktails were a bit of a let down. not to mention it was hot as Haites in the restaurant and I was not a particular fan of seeing my server constantly wipe sweat from his face. There was a floor fan oscillating that helped a little, Ive just had much better., Another place Ive been meaning to check off my list, and it has been one of the best meals Ive had recently. I went with 2 other friends and sat at the bar and the bartenders were very attentive.Appetizers: smoked ricotta crostini, chicken liver crostini, grilled octopus with pesto, and chilled tomato soup. You get 2 large pieces of crostini and I highly recommended them. The truffle honey compliments the smoked ricotta really well, but Id say go for the chicken liver for flavor. Loved the octopus as well, came with a bed of salad which was a nice touch! It was a hot DC day so I definitely appreciated the chilled tomato soup. All the appetizers were homeruns for me.Main: I got the sweetbread with polenta, my friends split the rigatoni and Ive been dreaming about both all week. My sweetbread was perfectly cooked and although I was bursting from my appetizers and drinks, I licked off my plate.We unfortunately didnt have room for dessert but Ill definitely be going back, especially with their Saturday night deal: $22 for crostini, pasta, glass of wine, 9.30pm-11pm!, I decided to give this a try after I read Tom Siestema review in the Post a couple of weekends ago. His review was favorable and he gave a nod to the wine selection. Being a wine geek, I was curious. So my dinner partner and I ordered the dolcetto and that was the best part of the meal. The food, in general was bland. It lacked kick; it needed to make a statement saying, I here! But it didn proclaim this.Service was very nice. The place is attractive. I return to give it another try., Well worth the trek to the border!House made pastas with delicate yet savory sauces - coupled with great affordable wines and cocktails - we will be back!Our group of 4 were whisked to our table right away and introduced to the great drinks menu.Appetizers:Smoked ricotta crostini: Even someone who said they didnt like ricotta liked this!Chicken liver crostini: HeavenOlives: Generous portion of flavorful goodnessEntrees:Squid Ink Pasta with Seafood: light and delicateRigatoni with Sausage: Perfectly chewy with huge chunks of loose sausageGnocchi: Interesting texture with polenta ingredients - not purely potatoes!Lamb Sandwich: Very fillingDesserts: Chocolate Cake with Cherries: Food coma, setting in!Basil Panna Cotta with Blueberries: So fresh and so clean tasting!All this yumminess and the service was knowledgeable, polite and seemed to enjoy being there! Great seating arrangements - parties were not on top of one another (a pet peeve)., Really loved my experience at the Red Hen. Very cozy and warm atmosphere, makes you feel like you are in Napa Valley. Speaking of which, they offer a very nice wine and cocktail selection. The food is tasty, creative-but-not-trying-too-hard, and fairly priced. Very good service overall as well. A few of the portions could have been a BIT larger, that would be my only critique. Ill certainly be back., I lucked out to move into the same neighborhood as the Red Hen-what a spot! Great atmosphere and even better food make this a perfect spot for a nice meal. The portions are such that you leave feeling content but not overstuffed. Make reservations well ahead of time for weekend dining., The ambience is amazing! The smell of wood burning, the beautiful chairs, and awesome bar is absolutely worth the price of the food. We had Orange Wine and it was delicious! The food was just outstanding! Get the halibut or the pasta dishes all of ours were amazing! We will beBack again and again! Our friend who was from Cincinnati loved every minute!!, After trying Red Hen twice, I dont recommend the place. My first visit was a let down. We stopped by for a late dinner. The restaurant was full but not packed. The service was rushed and unfriendly. The crostini appetizers were small and under seasoned. The pasta entrees came in small bowls and werent flavorful. We left hungry and disappointed. I hoped for more, being a resident of Bloomingdale. The second visit wasnt any better. Im worried Red Hen wont last, after the hype wears off. That would be unfortunate because Bloomingdale needs restaurants, stores and nightlife., Holy molly...what in gods name happened to Bloomingdale? This neighborhood has transformed across more than one spectrum. Alas, this is not the place to discuss the social justice implications of gentrification, only the culinary ones and the Red Hen is a perfect microcosm.The ambiance makes this place. A large square bar dominates the room and with it comes a host of bartenders serving delicious cocktails and wines from a significant wine list. AS for the food, the chicken liver crostini was delicious and though the roasted chicken and home made gnocchi were also quite good, they were a tad heavy handed with the salt.This place would be great for a date. Hurry and check it out before Bloomingdale becomes a neighborhood where you have to wait to get a table....sheesh, This place is amazing! It has raised the bar for food in the area. Ate there opening night and its my go to place when people are in town and I want to show off DCs culinary scene. You should ask yourself why havent I eaten here yet?, The Red Hen is one of my favorite new restaurants. On an aesthetic level, it just looks gorgeous when you walk in. Its a casual but intimate space, with an open kitchen and a central bar. Eventually they say there will be patio seating when the city approves it. There is certainly plenty of space for that. And there is a small herb garden that will eventually be put to use.First: alcohol. I started with the Take The Easy Way And Give In because Im a sucker for anything involving gin and lime. It was tasty and I would like to drink this for breakfast if I could. They also had a really interesting beer menu with drinks from all over, including several from Italy.For an appetizer we got the chicken liver crostini. It was amazing. If you like chicken liver at all, just order this and thank me later.I ordered the veal sweetbreads and Wifey got the garganelli with braised duck. The pasta was really good, as was the duck. We said we were going to share each dish but she ended up taking the lions share of the pasta because she liked it more. I cant really blame her.The veal sweetbreads were really good I thought. This is a richer dish with all the egg, polenta, and fat. Id never had sweetbreads before but this dish was a winner. It wasnt as good as the pasta and Id probably try something else next time, just because I like variety. She liked it too but was a bit put off by the idea of sweetbreads.We got the fried artichokes as a side. These were good but actually didnt have as much flavor as I hoped. Im not really sure why this was, because usually I think artichokes are quite tasty.Wifey demanded we get the panna cotta. She liked it a lot, but I didnt have much., This place is AMAZING!The ambience is great, it is decorated so beautifully.The food is absolutely delicious. I started with the chicken liver as well as ricotta crostinis to share for the table, delicious flavor combos for both. Then I had the Alaskan halibut for my main dish, also really yummy and cooked to perfection. Finally, we split the panna cotta for dessert and we almost licked the plate clean, it was THAT good.Just a great dining experience overall, HIGHLY recommended!, Everyone says it is awesome, and it was. Im echo-ing most of the other reviews - the service was great and they can direct you to a fabulous yet inexpensive wine. Place is cute and rustic and not pretentious. Volume was good and I see how this is now the neighborhood gem - there are enough seats around the large bar to come hang out on your own and enjoy the ambiance!As for food, this was the best halibut dish Ive ever had - I am going back just for that. The gnocchi was awesome. Flat bread with ricotta was yummy if you like smokey flavors. Too full to try dessert, will have to hit that up next time!Overall, amazing dinner, lovely service, great place, super excited to go again., You ABSOLUTELY need a reservation. Call in advance. The food, bar scene, and ambiance are worth it! I was lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar on my first visit. After a couple of cocktails, I was ready to dine. Scallops and polenta filled my belly in a marvelous way. These sea scallops were in squid ink over spinach and delicious. Eventhough the dish is black (no, seriously, I mean really black) I managed to look away with each bite. This dish goes in my personal DBU* category (*delicious but ugly). I knew it would be ugly when I ordered it and I am just so glad it was absolutely delicious. Thankfully, the side of polenta provided more visual appeal. Yes, this wedge of savory cornmeal was topped with the loveliest tomato compote ever. My eyes and palate were simultaneously pleased with this. Top that with the vibrant bar scene and a birds eye view of the busy open kitchen and Im a fan of the Red Hen. I hope to return one day soon and take a seat at the table., Believe the hype.This review will be, like most others, a rave for the Red Hen. The ambience is vaguely barn-like but in a homey and inviting way. The bar is large enough and offers a good selection of wine and cocktails. There were only two beers on tap which seems odd, but the IPA I had was tasty indeed. Our waiter was a highlight of the evening: he clearly loved good food, good beer, and good wine. His enthusiasm for the dishes on the menu couldnt have been faked. The menu is small-to-medium, but everything is innovative and made from very fresh ingredients. Our table shared the bean salad, corn and mozzarella salad, and octopus, all of which were super-fresh, simply prepared, and with innovative preparations. I had the gnocci pasta which was unlike any Id had before; I would recommend it. The deserts looked great, but by then we were stuffed. The prices are more than fair for the offerings: about $40 each with one drink.Red Hen suffers from the new-restaurant in DC buzz: make a reservation and do so far in advance. It will be worth it. A final note: I recommend cab or driving if youre going to be out after dark. Just sayin., I really, really, really wanted to love this place. Its been on my list for a while, and I was excited when we finally got a reservation. The place itself is gorgeous. We waited a little for our table to clear, and after we were seated, we had to wait for our server to acknowledge us. We started with:Drinks: the cocktails were tasty, but tasted more like mocktails. Switched to wine because it was a better deal and didnt taste like a glass of mixed juices. The drinks also took a solid 15 minutes to get to the table.Appetizers: the smoked ricotta crostini was good and had a unique taste. The fried artichokes were also unlike what Ive had at other places; Id say this was my favorite dish I had. The salt cod brandade was far too salty to be enjoyable, but I ended up eating more than I wanted to because the entrees took so long to both be ordered and arrive. In regard to service, it seemed like our waiter had pegged us for just a drinks/appetizers type, and didnt bother to stop by much because he was seemingly interested in more lucrative tables. Entrees: When they finally arrived, I was starving. Since part of my reason for living is eating pasta, I was so excited about the reviews Id heard about their homemade goods. The pasta itself was of an incredibly high quality. However, the dishes themselves were not. I got the duck garganelli, which had about 2 little bits of duck, marinara, and a ton of olives. It didnt have that extra savoriness that I had heard so much about. The other pasta dish on the table was the cacio e pepe. The pasta itself was very good, but the dish was also a disappointment. It was very basic and didnt evoke that primitive rustic sentiment it was trying to. The non pasta entree we had was the sweetbreads. My friend said he really did enjoy them, so I guess thats good.Dessert: I prayed that the final sweet note would redeem my dashed hopes. I took two bites of the chocolate cake with blueberries and wish I hadnt taken either. The dish was made in such a way that the two tastes didnt blend together, like they should. My friend ordered the egg cream and asked for a shot of Jack in it, because why not. This was definitely a good call. I enjoyed this dish too. All in all, Id come back one more time because, again, I really want to love this place. However, the service really has to step up its game. Id like to say Im always really patient with waiters, because I know it can be a sucky job, but this dining experience was notably frustrating., Went for dinner on a Sunday. The waiter was very knowledgeable and nice. Drinks were good, we opted for different wines. Food was fine - honestly, didnt really feel worth the price and the portions werent very big. Its just completely...fine. Ambience was good. Dont really get the hype., Pasta dishes are fantastic as are the crostini appetizers. My friend had the lamb sandwich once and loved it. The brandade was also delicious. Fried artichokes were simply ok. Nice wine and drink selection. Easy and comfortable design. Great new place.One of my favorite places in DC, With all the glowing reviews I was expecting more. The ambiance was very enjoyable. We sat at the bar and service was friendly and efficient. We enjoyed the wine selections by the glass, but the food wasnt that great. We had the rigatoni and gnocchi dishes but they were average in my opinion. No bread served, no pepper offered.Id go back to try the entrees again and to support a neighborhood spot that can only help to enhance the neighborhood., I had heard mixed reviews about service and the food, but we had a great night. Service was well paced and we never felt rushed. We shared a few appetizers I especially enjoyed the salads, so flavorful. The pastas were great especially the gnocchi, rich and delicate at the same time. Sebastian (owner/sommelier) chose a great and off the beaten path wine. He has a great wine list that is different yet affordable. Cocktails often change and are not to be missed. Ambience is open and loud, great place to go with friends., As with others, I want to like this place. Id say 4 stars for service and ambiance. The decor looks great. But unfortunately (based on one visit, 5 dishes) I cant give the food more than 2. The food is extremely rich but yet the flavors arent anything spectacular. And if youre used to eating something remotely healthy youll find the food here to be so rich as to be unappetizing. We ordered the sweetbreads and maybe both of us are just not sweetbread fans but we basically left the dish mostly untouched. The gnocchi was pretty good but half way through the dish it felt like too much (maybe too rich). The brussel sprouts were quite good except I was not a fan of the sauce. The desert we ordered (Brooklyn something) didnt work either. I did get an excellent glass of riesling (and ordered a second one, and will look it up online). So overall, everything was good except for the food. I hope the management can improve the food -- bring in more flavors and tone down the butter/cream/oil. If Id heard the food had improved Id definitely come back, but as it is Im going to hold off on going back for dinner, but would go for drinks. In summary: 2 stars for food, 4 stars for everything else, overall: 2.5, narrowly rounded to 3., Went back for the third time in a month and I havent been disappointed once. What a gem!The grilled octopus appetizer is strange but delicious. Flavorful, not at all fishy or chewy, and served over whipped pesto potatoes and frisee. Mmmmm.The duck ragu pasta is my favorite but the rigatoni is fantastic too. Best part is, both are under $20 (I think theyre $17 and $16 respectively). The Brussels sprouts are a MUST. As is the burrata and the short ribs if youve got room. It helps to have a reservation but if you go early enough (Im talking, 5:30 pm) you can usually get in just fine. I really cant speak highly enough of this restaurant. Oh, they started to serve bread too, so for anyone complaining, now youve got something yummy to nibble on when you sit down. Bloomingdale is lucky to have Red Hen., i went to The Red Hen because I live in the neighborhood and always walk past it. I think it is peculiar that there is such minimal signage outside as well. I didnt even know the name of the restaurant until I was inside. I was with one other friend and even though there were empty tables they said the wait was an hour, so we sat at the bar. The food was good and not too expensive but it wasnt anything I hadnt tasted before. The ambiance was very nice and our server was prompt. I didnt have a bad time at The Red Hen, but I also didnt have a good enough time to understand the raving reviews. I am not really in a rush to go back, but I probably will eventually., I had high hopes for Red Hen. Nine of us went for a birthday, and half the dishes were underwhelming. I arrived 90 minutes later, but my dining companions told me the service was slow. 30 minutes after they were seated, they had yet to order. By the time I arrived, the entrees had not arrived yet. My husband ordered the roast chicken. Not only did it cost $23, it was overly salty from the first bite. For that price, it had better be perfect.Another fingerling potato and greens salad was also salty. Why does a salad need salt in the first place?We should have sent the chicken back but it so awkward to have to wait and we didn want to break the festive mood. My biggest gripe is when I arrived later on, my husband asked owner Sebastian if we could add an extra chair. He just shook his head and said, Nope. That why we don make reservations for more than 8, but his tone said, Nope, youe just shit out of luck. So I sat in my husband lap as he ate his salty chicken. Then one our dining companions offered to share her chair, so we three sat on a makeshift bench of two chairs for the rest of the night, numb thighs and all.It would have been nice for Sebastian to explain why we couldn have an extra chair without coping such a drag queen attitude., Overall pretty good, but not out of this world... certainly some dishes better than others. The grilled octopus appetizer is definitely a must try! It was surprisingly delicious, I have no idea how they do it. Had the this smokey kind of flavor to it and did not taste fishy at all. I got the Halibut, it was good, but not too impressive. The ribs were alright, but probably the even less impressive. On the other hand, the roasted chicken was so good! The chicken was perfectly tender and the seasoning was right on. I also tried a bit of the mezze rigatoni which was good, but not really my style. Save room for dessert because the chocolate cake was absolutely delicious!! For the most part, I liked the simplicity and freshness of the meals. They are not huge plates either, so just keep that in mind!, Love this place. The atmosphere is cool and the food and drinks are spectacular. Order anything on the menu, and be sure to try the orange wine--you wont be disappointed.Highly recommended. Will definitely visit again., I love the look and feel of the place: the wood stacked everywhere, the heavy wood tables and chairs (though maybe a little too heavy to move easily) and the exposed brick. Its a bit dark if you dont sit by a window (Im prematurely old and really enjoy good lighting) but since we were in a window, everything was lovely. Its nice that they offer complimentary still and sparkling water. The waitstaff was a little overzealous with the water refills, but its not such a bad thing. We started with the clams casino ($12), which was good though nothing particularly special. We got the rigatoni and sausage ($16) and the short rib with barley ($24), and both were really good. The rigatoni had good chew and a generous blanket of cheese, and we got a good portion of short rib over a nice risotto of barley and mushrooms. I got the brussels sprouts ($8), which were fried and fine, but Ive had better/more interesting versions of this type of thing at Zaytinya and Ardeo + Bardeo, where they add some pomegranate seeds or nuts to make it pop a bit more. The dessert was the most disappointing part! I was pretty happy through the whole meal, but this really made it end on a blah note. We got chocolate cake ($8), which came cold, kind of weird and crumbly (not soft and spongy), with gelato that was not creamy at all but kind of sorbet-like. It came with a lot of chocolate sauce, which helped, but still didnt give me that rich, lovely chocolate cake I craved. I think Ill come back at least one more time to try out more things, but I know I wont be getting dessert!, If you had told me five years ago that the one of the most sought out restaurants in DC would be located in Bloomingdale, I would have told you you were crazy. And how wrong I would have been. The Red Hen brings style and good food to a corner of the city that is on fire these days.This corner space is airy, with exposed rafters and an open kitchen and an interior dominated by the large v-shaped bar. The food is Italian influenced, so I started with prossecco with baby octopus served over whipped pesto potatoes as an appetizer. The nicely charred octopus showed off the kitchen skill with their signature wood-fired grill. For a main I went with the Creste di Galli (cock comb) pasta with duck and black olives and finished with chocolate cake with cherries, chocolate sauce and roasted vanilla gelato. Perfection!A dozen wines by the glass (all European), including two that owner/wine maven Sebastian Zutant calls orange wines (I think we used to call these ros39, but hey, they are kinda orange colored!) Beer is not overlooked either, with 16 choices, some by the glass or bottle, including three Italian microbrews and four meads/ciders. They also have an interesting collaboration beer made with DC Brau that been aged in red wine barrels.They keep about 50% of their seats open for walk-ins, but be warned, there will be a long waiting list at peak hours, but you can leave your number and mosey on over to Showtime Lounge or Boundary Stone for a drink while youe waiting., I don know how this place gets any negative reviews! Like Pearl Dive, for price to quality ratio, The Red Hen is one of the best restaurants in the city. It won bankrupt you, the food is consistently good, the place has a nice vibe, and most importantly -- they make their own pasta. Ie been three times now and haven been disappointed in anything.Is the Red Hen a Michelin Star restaurant? No. But it doesn advertise itself as being one, either. If you go into it expecting that because the place is popular and has been getting a ton of buzz, youe setting your expectations incorrectly. Recalibrate. What the Red Hen is, however, is a great neighborhood restaurant where you want to go for a modern take on comfortable food. It isn necessarily the special occasion dinner, it the we want great food and a good night out without putting on a sport coat or dress.Of special note is that the pastas are all really really good and I think are the best value around (theye better, IMO, then many of the Italian restaurants downtown that charge twice as much). Clams Casino and the namesake Hen dish are also strong.Don be afraid to come here if you can score a reservation -- they have a huge, really nice, U-shaped bar (that faces the open flame grill) area that you can probably score a pair of seats at if youe willing to linger for a little bit., Delicious! We went on a Thursday night and were able to score seats at the bar. DC Brau was offering a collaboration beer, that was delicious! A porter aged in bordeaux barrels that had a smokey, fruity flavor. We ordered lamb meatballs and a pasta dish of some sort, both were absolutely incredible! We were still hungry though, and ordered the chocolate cake and egg cream, both of which were very good as well. This is definitely the kind of place where you need to order courses in order to leave feeling full. We will be back to sit at a table, order a bottle of wine, and enjoy the whole experience., At best its average. Went midweek so we were immediately seated. The service was pleasant, but the food was just ok. The menu was dated so will try again in November., The service was great. I had a pretty good cocktail. it was a little expensive but I knew what I was getting myself into. A bottle of wine that was pretty tasty too. I kind of regretted my dinner choice - carmelized scallops - but my dates pasta was delicious. Mine was good, but there was other good food on the menu. Ill go back for sure, but not before I explore DC a bit., So first let me say I enjoyed going to dinner here AND would recommend it to others to try -- however I have to say that overall the meal was a little lacking.Ive read on this board that its important to taper expectations of this place: its a good local restaurant, but not a 5 Star kind of show. Thats absolutely the truth. First off, the cocktails -- I had a bourbon based drink and my partner had a unique French cider, both delicious. We also ordered a bottle of Orange wine (white wine with extra notes of tanins and dryness from the skin which is left on during fermentation), which was delicious; the sommelier knew his stuff.However, the meal itself was a bit disappointing. The burrata starter was very one dimensional offering a bland cheese over a bed of mushrooms that were barely seasoned, as a result it was a very quiet and uninteresting dish. The celery root soup was very good, on the other hand, though a bit awkward in that it had 4 different flavors going on at once (celery root, maple, halibut, and cream).As for the meal we ordered the Grouper, the cresti di gallo with duck, and their side of brussel sprouts. The Grouper was overcooked (were not talking just a little bit, it was simply dry...) and the bed of beans that it sat on was so al dente that it verged on rawness. The cresti di gallo was overwhelmed by olives which were not even mentioned on the menu and the duck was completely tasteless: saying it tasted like chicken would be an improvement. The brussel sprouts were delicious, salty and buttery and tasted like roasted popcorn -- however the between the butter used to cook the sprouts and the aioli sauce it was served with, just a few bites left my stomach full of fats and salt that just didnt feel like a good meal, let alone fine dining.Overall Im glad I went and tried it out -- the atmosphere is wonderful, the location quaint and quiet (calm neighborhood feel, but surrounded by people) and the menu seems full of possibility. A few of the items need to be seasoned differently and perhaps a little more attention should be paid to taking a decent dish and making it memorable. Try it for yourself, but for the money Ill be going elsewhere next time!, Maybe the best meal weve had in DC ( the bar is low but The Red Hen would be successful in NY or SF). Cool ambience and really spectacular food. Great service., I cannot say enough about the food and wine here. I am a picky eater and there were tons of things on the menu I wanted to try. We started with the yummy truffle honey bread, brussel sprouts and orange wine. Gotta try the orange wines. Last night they had two by the glass. Tasty and perfect with the menu. Moved on to pasta- you cannot go wrong. Friend got the lamb meatballs. The spaghetti squash was tasty. Completed dinner with more amazing wine and Carmel corn. Very good dinner. Amazing bar service. I love eating at the bar. Attentive and wonderful service. This is a Bloomingdale gem., This place is so lovely. My husband and I dropped in on a Sunday right at 5pm to check out the menu and grab a drink. We had planned on going somewhere else entirely, so we were a touch underdressed with tshirts and jeans, but we sat at the bar and were welcomed well. We looked over the menu, and although everything looked delicious, my husband was just craving a pizza or bar food, so we ended up not eating there. But we most definitely will. Instead, we just had a drink each. I opted for the red ipa fromo North Carolina, and the husband selected the DC BRAU and RED Hen colloboration beer called Dorcia. It was the Penn Quarter Porter but aged in red wine barrels. They were both good, but naturally I liked mine better. The inside was very lovely and inviting. The bathrooms were cute, and our bartenders were sweet and soft spoken. I wish I could provide more information, but even without sampling the food, we would definitely return., Ive gone multiple times and love this establishment. The food and wine are inspired and delicious. You cant beat the atmosphere, clients and vibe of this local neighborhood restaurant. The prices are reasonable given the quality of the food and experience you will. Highly recommend if you want top notch foodie experience in DC surrounded by locals with out the insane lines, prices and clients of 14th St/Logan Circle., For a reminder that you live in DC (read: a developing, improving food scene), look no further than Red Hen. The food is better than youl find at several new DC restaurants, absolutely, and the ambience is incredible... but be prepared to suffer through the staff rudeness and unwarranted arrogance that goes along with, Hey! Wee a new DC place that doesn suck! (or big-fish-in-small-pond syndrome).We all have different priorities when dining out. If you can put up with the a good degree of conceit, go have a decent meal here. If not, steer clear. I live nearby; I so desperately want to like this place. However, I can seem to justify throwing any more money (and not small amounts of it) at a place where the management and staff pretension makes a stronger impression than the food., I have been to this restaurant a few times, and each time I dine there, the service and food seems to get worse. The first time I went there, I was impressed by the ambiance, food and service. I thought it was a little pricey, but was completely willing to overlook that because I enjoyed the service and atmosphere so much and to a slightly lesser extent, the food. However, this past experience was far from impressive. I ordered the scallops, which were cooked quite well, but the bed of couscous was very bland. My girlfriend ordered the short ribs, which was much better. The crostini with ricotta cheese was on point as usual. I just felt like something was lacking in overall quality of food from my previous two experiences. But these things happen and it could have been an isolated incident.What I couldnt really look past however was the pretentious attitude of the server. I tried and tried to give him the benefit of the doubt, but his arrogance was very difficult to ignore. Ive never understood why some people feel like they have to be condescending toward customers. I thought at first that we may have gotten off on a bad foot because I had immediately pointed out a mistake on their beer menu, but it continued throughout our dinner. I will give him credit for one thing; he did recommend a very good wine. Anyway, I dont think Ill be going back there...well maybe for drinks as I do really enjoy the smell of the burning wood and the decor is spot in my opinion. Plus I live in the neighborhood and there arent too many other options., Was SO happy to be here and didnt want to leave! The ambiance was very cool, just dark enough and just quiet enough to be the perfect Saturday night spot to have a good conversation but also be surrounded by others. We were at the U-shaped bar, which very coolly faces the open fire and kitchen. We had great service and didnt even have to wait for a seat, despite not having reservations. Great beer and wine selection as well--I had a red from Serbia that Im pretty sure is not widely available at other restaurants, and my boyfriend had a DuClaw beer, which we think is the best unknown brewery in the country!For the food, the squash soup was hands down the best thing we ordered--so creamy and fragrant with sage, and textured with the pumpkin seeds to give some bites a little crunch! We also got the ricotta & honey crostinis, which were perfect little appetizers, and fusilli with butternut squash and bacon--which was simple and not overpowering, but still so delicious. I dont normally get dessert, but after the amazingness of everything else, I had to go for the maple custard, which did not disappoint--soooo creamy and perfectly sweet, not over-the-top at all--you could tell it was made right there, probably that morning. I understand the menu changes frequently though, so the menu on its website from June is NOT the same menu we had last night. I cant wait to go back and try something else!
73|the-riggsby-washington|I love this place. Seriously. So if you dont know about it, its in the Carlyle Hotel, which was recently taken over by Kimpton who is phenomenal. The chef behind the Riggsby is Michael Schlow who also owns the Tico on 14th and U as well as other restaurants in Boston. I had read that he was looking for it to be a neighborhood place, and boy is it ever. The feel of the place is like a restaurant your parents took you to growing up. It just feels classic, like its been there for 35 years, which is a testament to the designers. I sat at the bar and was expertly served by Nico and Alex. Theyre still working out their bar selection and Im hopeful that the bourbon and rye choices expand, though they had all the favorites. Had the deviled eggs with chicken skin, which were terrific, followed by their house chopped salad which was an awesome combination of green beans, eggs, bacon in a house thousand island dressing that wasnt too heavy. Then I also had the burger with a bacon jam and that was perfectly cooked (medium rare, because if you get it well done you clearly hate America).Schlow who I actually met when he sat at the bar said he was going for comfort food and a neighborhood place. I think the vibe, plus the current bar hours ending at midnight will keep the douchebags away. Its perfect and I want to go back. If Alex is there, and you like dark liquors, ask for a vieux carre. It was complicated and amazing., Sitting in the inviting interior of the retro styled Riggsby, I kept expecting Kevin Costner and Sean Connery to burst in with shotguns al la The Untouchables and ruin everything. And, even though seeing Sean Connery and Federal Agent Elliot Ness would have been awesome, Im very glad they didnt interrupt because the dinner we enjoyed turned out to be fit for a 1920s mob boss. The look and feel of the Riggsby is a throw-back to be sure. The bar dominating the front of the restaurant is invitingly secluded and just steps from the lobby of the beautifully renovated Carlyle hotel. The bar itself makes you feel right at home, even if youre not wearing a double-breasted wool suit and toting a Tommy Gun. But, after warming up with a classic cocktail (served up in style, of course), the food takes a modern approach to classic dishes. The menu is extremely approachable and offers excellent preparation of some classic dishes - including a NY strip, a roasted chicken (delicious), and schnitzel (also tasty). Portions are generous and flavors were spot-on. Desserts were highly recommended and included a goats milk cheesecake which made leaving that much harder. The overall experience was made that much more enjoyable by the open-window kitchen that let you watch the action while you waited, and a restaurant seating area that isnt cavernous enough to let some prohibition agents sneak up on you while you enjoy a delicious dinner., The Riggsby (located next to The Carlyle) is a welcomed addition to the competitive DC restaurant landscape. We had an amazing dining experience at this restaurant thanks to Joe, Eric and Daniel. The meal started with appetizers of jalapeno tater tots, chorizo stuffed mushrooms and deviled eggs. These bar snacks are unlike anything wee ever eaten. The jalapeno tater tots are peppers wrapped in potato and perfectly fried so that they were ever so tasty and not greasy. The mushrooms were cooked so that the restaurant-made chorizo complemented the juicy mushrooms. Finally, calling them deviled eggs does not do justice to these works of arts which included just the right amount of crispy chicken skin. Our entrees of seared scallops, slow cooked salmon and NY strip filet were EXCELLENT. Each was accompanied with vegetables that completed each dish. These were not the seasonal vegetables that you get at many restaurants. The vegetables were strategically selected so that each entree was an experience in taste. Be sure to go to this restaurant with friends because you will definitely be picking at each others plate!, I found out the restaurant opens at 5 pm and no sooner when I slid the pocket doors to the sides and found no one at the hostess stand a few minutes before. After walking through the key shaped door frame to enter The Riggsby, I was immediately struck by the retro styled restaurant with its open kitchen, wood tables, deep leather booths, oak panels, wonky pictures, and white tablecloths. The restaurant is definitely larger than one would expect with plenty of bar area seating (some near a window) and plenty of dining room seating.For awhile, a friend and I were the only ones there so we were careful not to speak too loudly as the number of workers outnumbered the diners. To my surprise, when we left around 6:45 pm last night, the number of people at the bar was quite large. I believe our servers name was Sam. He promptly greeted us and welcomed us and offered the drink and dinner menus. He came back a couple of times to check on us and asked if we had questions. I asked how large the NY strip filet was, and he told me it was about 8 - 9 ounces. Complimentary bread and butter was offered with the bread being offered one slice at a time. Its a typical rustic bread: porous with a good crunchy crust. I ended up eating three slices! :-(My friend and I shared the chorizo stuffed mushrooms, which came in a group of six in a cast iron pan. Sam came over to ask how things were, and I told him it was very hot, but good. He asked if that meant temperature or spice level, and I indicated the former but noted there was some kick to the mushrooms. Our dinners came out at the same time, with Sam pouring the cherry tomatoes, sausage, onions, and potatoes onto the pork chops at the table. I thought that was unusual and did not understand the rationale for that. My friend, who ordered the entree, did not either.We traded a couple of bites of our entrees. I really thought the pork chops and my steak were fantastic. Although I ordered the steak medium, it looked a little more medium rare, but no problem as it was juicy and tender and paired well with the spinach which had large and thin slices of garlic. The b39arnaise sauce was an overindulgence. I could have done without the French fries and did so for the most part, as they were cold pretty quickly and before I could get to them, which is a good thing because I wanted dessert.My friend and I split the old fashioned chocolate chocolate cake although he took two tiny bites, and I devoured the rest.Dessert is my favorite course, and The Riggsby do not disappoint. (I wonder if I can come here and just eat dessert?) The chocolate cake had three layers interspersed with chocolate mousse and was coated with a chocolate shell. On top of that was a toasted coconut topping and a mint garnish, which Sam pointed out was the only thing left on the plate when he cleared it. The plate also had some caramel sauce, almonds, more coconut shavings, and a vanilla gelato. Note, its not ice cream and is slightly icier and more refreshing and light than ice cream. YUM! Everything is very flavorful and service here was great. People came over to fill our glasses throughout our meals (I think things were a bit of a salt bomb for me. I ended up going home drinking more water and forcing fruit down to counter the salt intake); bread crumbs were swept away; plates were swapped; utensils changed as per our orders. Sam came over and asked us how things were and it was clear he was watching us without being obtrusive. Plates were cleared promptly, and only once, because I had cut a larger piece than I should have, was I caught with food in my mouth and did not answer right away.Other random tidbits: We saw Chef Michael Schlow being photographed for the Post. I did notice the mismatched plates, and someone in a suit, whom I presume to be the GM, came over to check on my friend and me towards the end of the meal. I was very impressed with our experience and quality of food and service., This place is a stellar addition to the neighborhood. I almost dont want to write this review because it will only make it harder to get a table there. The place sets itself apart from the lobby of the Carlyle (which will be revived thanks to this place) and has a great looking bar--will be especially perfect in winter. The food, from appetizers to entrees to dessert, was really great. Had the chorizo-stuffed mushrooms, roast chicken (cleaned a very large plate) and then ordered the lemon blueberry goat cheese cheesecake for dessert. The wait time for food was a little long (assume its just kinks being worked out during week 2 of operation), so they comped our table another round of wine and beer, and they also brought everyone the cookie plate to double down on hospitality. Great place all around, cant wait to go back., Wow, wow, and wow! I REALLLLY liked this place. If you read my other reviews, I a stickler for service. The Riggsby has incredible service on every level and from all we interacted with. When you combine such refined service with an amazing ambiance (great decor, perfect background music) and extremely delicious food... what else can you say but, WOW! (Yes, that is my fourth Wow in this review!)I hate to spread the word too loudly, but this place is going to be difficult to get into as the word gets out. I sampled the delicious Deviled Eggs and Jalapeno Tater Tots -- both with enough kick to make spicy food lovers happy. The Butter Lettuce Salad was light and refreshing... and very tasty. The Pork Chop entree was huge. I loved that it was completely sliced off the bone after grilling. The spicy sausage and scrumptious potatoes really made this more than a single meal.I highly recommend this spot... I will surely be back..., Simply exceptional. I will gush about the food momentarily but it is worth calling out first the incredible service. Attentive, friendly and so thoughtful without being stuffy in the slightest. Cocktails were fantastic and memorable. Now for the food--smoked trout was fabulous, burst of flavors and textures on one plate. Jalape31o Tater tots were a total tasty surprise. Caesar, often over looked, but this was a surprise. Every entree on the table was notable--from presentation to flavor. I wish I had leftovers so I could eat for lunch today but it was clean plates all around. The chicken, the pork, the shnitzel, the barrel cut steak...you simply cant go wrong. And though Im not a dessert person, it was a similar story for dessert. Strawberry shortcake was a show stopper, cheesecake savory and delicious, and the plate of cookies was both fun and addictive. Point being--if you havent been, you must go. I know every member of our 6 person party is sharing the same message this morning. Raves all around!, I don give out 5 stars too often, however, after discussing our meal here, my husband thought that The Riggsby was deserving when it came to 5 stars.I subscribe to Zagat newsletter for DC. In the latest issue, they had a feature 8 Must Try Chicken Dishes in DC. On that list was The Riggsby roasted chicken. That convinced me to give it a try. I normally don order roasted chicken when eating out because often it is dried out and flavorless. The way the dish was described by Zagat had me wanting to try it.We made a reservation for 5 p.m. on a Saturday. It turned out that a reservation wasn necessary because at that hour, most people had gravitated to the bar for drinks and food items that are on the bar menu.As other Yelpers pointed out, The Riggsby is in the Carlyle Hotel. Upon entering the hotel, walk up a few steps and turn right. The entry to the restaurant is shaped like a keyhole.The friendly hostess seated us immediately. Shortly thereafter, our server came to our table. He was friendly, efficient and knowledgeable about the menu. More than once, people who worked there asked if we had been here before. We told them it was our first time and how we came to know about the place.We started with drinks. I had a cocktail called Last Frontier. It consists of: bourbon, amaretto, lemon and cinnamon. I was impressed with this drink as all the flavors were there and worked very well together. My husband ordered a French Chardonnay called Nicholas Potel, Pouilly Fuisse (from Burgundy). He said it had a bit of a bite in the beginning but became smoother after a few sips.For an appetizer, we chose Creamy Burrata. It consists of: with summer tomatoes, good olive oil and bottarga. After getting home, we looked up bottarga. It either grey mullet or tuna roe. It was grated over the burrata and gave it a somewhat fishy taste. The server was thoughtful enough to have the burrata served to us in separate plates which made it easier than having to divide it up ourselves. The heirloom tomatoes were at their peak and very flavorful. A piece of toasted bread was served with it and when the burrata was put on top of the bread, it cut down on the fishy flavor of the bottarga.Of course, I ordered the roasted chicken and it was amazing! The skin was crispy and flavorful and the meat was tender and juicy. This dish also has in it: with broccoli rabe, roasted potatoes and mustard. In addition, there were also a few pearl onions, some thinly slivered garlic and black peppercorns. The roasted potatoes were small ones that were perfectly roasted. The broccoli rabe was sauteed, and of course, on the bitter side. Yet I found that taking a forkful of chicken, broccoli rabe and potatoes caused the flavorings to meld together very well. My husband tried some of my chicken and he, too, was impressed.My husband ordered seared scallops. There are 5 scallops per plate. This dish also consists of: with mushrooms, onions and peas. However, instead of peas, his dish had asparagus, which he didn mind. While he enjoyed the scallops, saying that they were cooked to perfection, he said that the veggies almost put the scallops to shame, they were that good. As he put it, they could have stood on their own.We actually had some room for dessert. My husband had his eye on the strawberry shortcake which comes with Chantilly cream that is put between 2 biscuit halves. He said that the strawberries were ripe and flavorful and that the cream didn appear to have been sweetened but he liked it that way.I had the Tahitian vanilla creme brulee which was good with lots of vanilla beans. It also came with 2 strawberry slices, 2 blackberries, 2 blueberries and a sprig of mint. While Ie had better creme brulee, I found no fault with it here.Service was excellent. The manager even stopped by to see how things were going. Our server was attentive without being obtrusive. Our table was cleared of dishes as soon as we were finished. We, of course, took photos and our server wondered about that and asked if they would be put online. I told him that they were going on Yelp and let him know that they needed more photos of their food put on the page.We really enjoyed our meal and I recommend that if you like roasted chicken, head on over to The Riggsby! The decor brings the 30 and 40s to mind. The background music tended towards old Spanish and Cuban songs. Some of the dishware was colonial in design---so the design features weren very consistent but somehow it all worked out well.Before the tip, dinner was $127 + change. A splurge to be sure but you can eat more cheaply at the bar or order less items than we did!, Limited menu that is not vegetarian friendly. As Jose Andres noted, chefs are turning to the various flavors and textures that can be unlocked from vegetables. A nostalgic setting but not one I would want to go back to., Excellent, start to finish. Generous and delicious pork chops. Great sardines. Cool place., Went for a labor day brunch with my husband and another couple. Great ambiance with their fun retro decor (made for lots of conversation starters). Brunch plates were very reasonably priced for their portion sizes and quality. I loved my pancakes! They were light, somewhere between crepes and traditional pancakes, with a hint of citrus. Couldnt help but devour them! My husband felt the same about his egg sandwich which was loaded with prosciutto. Service was also incredibly attentive., Speaking only of brunch, I would not recommend going to The Riggsby. The menu is uninspired and the quality of the dishes was weak. The crab on the avocado toast with Maryland crab meat, jalapeno and pickled red onion shared plate lacked any favor and seemed pretty poor quality. The morning after sandwich with eggs, prosciutto cotto and pecorino was just OK (you can find far better egg, ham and cheese sandwiches at nearly any greasy spoon in the metro area). And the side of potatoes that came with the sandwich were under cooked and under seasoned. The egg white omelet was served with toast that was so hard it could have been used as a weapon. I will give some props to the deviled eggs with calabrian chilies and crispy chicken skin. It also important to note that the least expensive brunch cocktail, a small mimosa, will set you back $8., The food was amazing. We had the scallops and the roasted chicken. The chicken was probably the best chicken dish Ive ever had at a restaurant. It is the same chef and owner as Tico which is another favorite of mine in DC. The jalape31o tots were delicious, and surprisingly not spicy. The Devils eggs were equally delicious and mildly spicy. The scallops were cooked perfectly. The ambiance of the restaurant is also great really gives you an old time feel. Service was excellent also., Staying at Kimpton & stopped in for a salad at the end of a long day. Couldnt believe what we got for $16. It fit into the palm of your hand. To their credit, they took it back & refunded the money. Its hard to believe that people are willing to overpay - we are not among them., We live around the corner, and went back for a second look - same stellar service, amazing food and all-around dining experience. Add the stuffed shrooms, chopped salad, spaghetti, NY strip and chocolate cake to the list of excellent dishes. 100% that we will be back again soon to try the remaining items on the menu. Staff loves locals and management obviously wants to make this more than just a hotel restaurant/bar., So much yes for dinner. Meh for brunch. So I won even go there. The ambiance is very inviting, and would be great for a date, parental dinner, or girl night. Buzz without being too loud. There were an eclectic mix of patrons here, from tourists, to families, to dressed up 20-somethings out for a group dinner, to dressed down 30 somethings on dates-- that us-- and a table of disapproving 70 somethings who gave our khaki and sundress-clad selves the up/down. We had amazing, attentive service from Natalie who was one of the best servers Ie encountered recently in DC. She was absolutely lovely. Attentive without being overbearing and a huge help about the menu. I loved the combination of recognizable, unpretentious dishes done well. A few menu pointers: Yelpers are NOT KIDDING about the chicken. Don think to yourself Meh, it roasted chicken and I can just pick of those up at Nando or Whole foods and I should get something I wouldn cook at home. Just order it. I did not, but my dining companion did, and I spent the entire meal coveting his dinner. This might be my new death row meal along with a Brown Butter doughnut from District Doughnut. sidenote- it big enough for two.  Please do not overlook the chorizo stuffed mushrooms which were the best things Ie put in my mouth all summer That what she said? Save room for coffee and dessert. I had a delicious strawberry shortcake. One of the more memorable meals Ie had of late. Welcome Riggsby- I hope you do well., Excellent dinner in such a retro cool atmosphere. The professional wait staff was en pointe! Really liked Natalies engagement. The back wait staff were attentive and accommodating also. Our Bulleit rye perfect Manhattans were cold and smooth. We started with the house made jalape31o tater tots and grilled sardines. Delicious and beautifully placed. Shared a chopped salad with house made Thousand Island. Deelish! Entrees were the scallops and a duck special. Both wonderful and beautifully plated. Only complaints..... A little skimpy on the carrot pur39e with the duck and the butter was WAY too cold both times we were brought some. It was plated nicely with a sprinkling of sea salt that was lost on the butter temperature. Its the little things too. Will be back....want the burger., Excellent! Not a surprise, given the team behind this spot...lets meet the players involved:The Food and Drink:Owner Chef Michael Schlow, the mind behind TICO..so already you know it is going to be first rate. Everything coming out of the kitchen is fantastic here.The Atmosphere:Edit Lab of Streetsense created the space. If Im being honest, usually if Streetsense is involved, the location is going to be great and so is the aesthetic.If your in Dupont circle, this spot could easily become one of your favorites...and the location in The Carlyle is a bit hidden, which is nice.It may seem simple but you cant go wrong with a sazerac and burger...perfection., Wow! WOW! This place is ON POINT. Excellent food that is made quickly and expertly. Interesting dishes with not too much food on the plate. You will go home satisfied and not bursting. Great wine selection and excellent wait staff. I really appreciated seeing each member of the staff checking on all the tables consistently and moving quickly to get water filled, plates cleared, and checks run. Everything is a well-oiled machine! Try the chorizo stuffed mushrooms and the strawberry shortcake with chantilly cream! Im ready to try their breakfast!, After a long flight & drive, hubby and I were starving and we inquired about grabbing some food at the Carlyle restaurant, The Riggsby. On Wednesday nights it closes at 10:30pm (the kitchen, NOT the bar). Uh Oh, it was 10:20pm. We swiftly entered the keyhole entrance to a loud & happening bar scene. Hostess sat us immediately to the restaurant portion and I was grateful that the restaurant portion of Riggsby was quieter and intimate.Our server, Natalie, immediately greeted us and we grimaced telling her that we needed to eat STAT, although the kitchen was closing shortly. She assured us it was not a problem to get us some food before the kitchen closed. AWESOME. She put in our food order right away. As each item was brought out, we were delighted with each dish. DELISH.What did we try that first night (I specify first, because we returned several more times.)Deviled Eggs: ExcellentJalapeno Tator Tots: I only got to try one, hubby took these downMussels Mariniere: Great. Broth had a bit of a kick and the standard shallots, butter & chivesBarrel Cut NY Strip Filet cooked Medium Rare: Hubby told Natlie we wanted to split this and she had the kitchen split it in half on plates. NICE! (Usually, places just hand you an extra plate.)Drinks:Mule on the Mind: Excellent. We loved this twist on a Moscow Mule. Glass of Bouchard Pinot Noir: Very Good and paired nicely with the NY StripOur dinner experience was definitely 5 stars. Service & Food was Outstanding.However, we returned for breakfast & lunch and service wasn as spot on as it had been at dinner. Plus, I found a few items that I didn like from the menu.Favorite additional items:Breakfast: Maryland Crab Hash & poached eggs, crispy potatoes, piquillo peppers & old bay hollandaise. Excellent.Beef Carpaccio-shaved mushrooms, lemon arugula: delicate & light & tastyClassic Caesar Salad: Lots of shaved parmesan & 2 anchovies. Yum.Also, they carry a great Sancerre.Items to pass on:Avocado toastCheese plateCappuccinoThe bar scene is happening and loud. Lots of people like to stop here and grab a drink. Because The Riggsby was just named as food critic, Tom Sietsema Top 10 restaurants in DC in the Washington Post, reservations strongly recommended on the weekend., Disappointed! The four of us shared calamari and mussels as appetizers. The calamari was interesting and good although not exceptional. The broth accompanying the mussels was way too salty and too spicy. The schnitzel was OK but the side potatoes were uninspired. With a relatively short menu, would would expect everything at The Riggsby to be amazing but it was far from that. Service was good. Value for the money was not there., If I could, this would get a 3.5 for the food and drinks, but our very excellent waiter bumps it to a 4. The mixed drinks were excellent (especially their version of a Moscow Mule), but our bottle of red was not remotely the quality it should have been for the price point.Appetizers were great - definitely get the mussels! Easily the best thing we ate. I was excited to try the pork dish after reading so many positive comments, but found it undercooked and underseasoned, with toppings that just tasted like pickle juice. It was very disconcerting. Id go back for the mussels and drinks, but not sure Id give full dinner another shot., I had a limited breakfast experience here, but I will be back and potentially update the review. I suggested this as a place for brunch after all of the stellar reviews its been getting. We showed up at 10:45 on a Saturday and were told that breakfast was over and that brunch was ony on Saturdays. My friend managed to sweet talk them into getting us the breakfast menu. They were very kind about it and attentive. The restaurant was basically empty when we were there, which was a bit surprising, but it might have been because we were there a few days after Thanksgiving. Its a beautiful space. A lot of light. Lots of dark wood. They have mismatched plates which could seem a bit cutesy especially because each table has the same mismatched plates, but overall, its a beautiful space. I ordered the mushroom, asparagus & goat cheese omelette. My friend got the typical eggs with sausage and potatoes. They are quite good with the condiments. Each plate came with potatoes, bread, jam, and butter. The omelette was well prepared, had a lot of cheese with veggies that had been sauteed beforehand. I found the prices, for breakfast at least, to be quite reasonable., Restaurant is a throwback to the dark wood panels era. Feels a bit stuffy, and definitely classy. Service was great, here are two examples: my partner spilled a bit of sauce on the table from the calamari dish, and the server came along and laid a clean napkin over the spot, so we could continue holding hands. Another was when we got the broccoli rabe removed from the check, because we both took a bite and disliked it. It might have been the vegetable itself, I was expecting more of an EVOO/garlic flavor. That was nice of them to do that.We got the heritage farm pork chop and the scallops. The pork chops were surprisingly spicy, but both of us liked that. The sausage in the dish was also very flavorful. I dont eat seafood, but I enjoyed the vegetables in the scallop dish. The bourbon pecan pie was rich and we tasted the bourbon. I was glad we shared the dessert because it mightve been too much for me to finish by myself. It was a good meal overall., I came here for a friends birthday. The service was great and the place was quite stylish. The food was decent, but I only had the deviled eggs., The Riggsby is a fine establishment., I stumbled in late at night after getting off a plane. I wanted a hamburger and a beer; the Riggsby delivered!The Riggsby seems to be a popular eating place and watering hole. Even well past the usual dinner hour, almost all of the tables were taken. The bar was busy as well.The burger, with bacon-onion jam, cheese & french fries, had a surprisingly small diameter but was reasonably thick. It was still somewhat on the small side for a $16 burger. It was cooked to my specification (rare) and was very tasty.The beer, a Belgian-style ale from Virginia, was almost boring. I expected something a bit more assertive from a craft brewery.The service was OK, but I had to ask the server who brought out my burger to chase down my beer -- it was poured by the bartender after I ordered it but was languishing at the side of the bar until my second request.I liked the experience and would be happy to repeat it. I was going to put down four stars until I realized while writing this review that I had several negative things to say., The new husband and I were finally in DC on a Friday night and looking for somewhere new to check out when I remembered seeing the Riggsby on a few different local blogs. We didnt have reservations, but its down the street from our apartment so we risked it and went ahead to check it out. Surprisingly, at 8pm we were able to sit almost immediately. The restaurant had a great vibe - not super loud but busy and full of people enjoying dinner. Our server was also really great, always there when we needed her but not around too much.We ordered a couple specialty cocktails to start - I went for Mule On My Mind, a play on a Moscow mule and he went for the Champ. Both of us were really pleased with the drinks, which were well mixed and tasty. We also opted to start with the jalape31o tots. While waiting on our app, we were served sliced bread thats brought around by a server along with some butter. The butter was realllllly good - it was super creamy and had been well salted. I know, I know, its just bread and butter but we both agreed it was delicious and better than the average stuff. We were slightly disappointed with the tots - you only get 8 and they definitely lack any kind of -spicy punch. Theyre clearly homemade, so thats nice but Id skip them next time. For dinner, we split the burger and fries. This was a much more impressive plate. The sandwich was big enough to split, easily. The patty was tasty and the bacon was a great addition, plus we loved the tomato jam. The fries were also delicious.Overall, wed definitely come here again. Its not the *best* burger in DC (that still goes to Dukes), but the food was still tasty and we liked the ambiance so well be back to keep exploring the menu. I would give it 5 stars but $6 for 8 small tater tots is kind of ridiculous, even for DC., Wow, this place was fantastic, totally exceeded our expectations. The Cote de Bouef is out of this world. In addition to amazing food, the service was incredible-- knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. Well definitely be back., Ate at The Riggsby for brunch today. Great service especially considering how packed the restaurant was for brunch (at 11:30 am). I had the breakfast burrito without chorizo (vegetarian) which was pretty decent, but needed a little something extra. My suggestion would be to offer a vegetarian meat substitute if someone asks to make something vegetarian. The breakfast potatoes / home fries on the side were cooked very well, though some of the pieces of onion and pepper were huge and should have been chopped smaller. Both my Riggsby Bloody Mary and Paloma (made with vodka instead of the typical tequila) were excellent. My only real gripe was how jam-packed the seating area was - our table was maybe less than a foot from the tables on either side of us. Im only trying to enjoy my friends company, not that of the table next to ours as well. I cant fault them for capitalizing on the popularity of this place, but it just makes for a slightly less than ideal dining experience. Our server - cant recall her name - short brown hair/tattooed arms and very cool oversized watch - was very friendly and tipped us off to the great weekday happy hour / cocktail party The Riggsby has. Cant wait to come back and enjoy some of the evening offerings. Great addition to the neighborhood!, a nice addition to the neighborhood., I was excited to try this place because it popped up as a new business on Yelp. I got there and was much less excited when I realized it was a hotel restaurant. But, you never know -- so onwards we go.The dining area was really quite nice, very picturesque dining room.However, the food was just very sub-par and with small portions. Usually the appetizers are indicative of the quality of a restaurant, and more likely than not, they are also the most creative/innovative dishes -- to me, the best. So, on we ordered some of the more interesting sounding bites.Deviled eggs with chilies and chicken skin -- rather bland. Im a deviled egg fanatic and really these were just sub-parJalapeno tater tots. Meh. They werent even crispy. What the heck?Chorizo stuffed mushrooms. Again, meh. Nothing very interesting.Also had the scallops, and again, not good. How do you screw up scallops? Theyre honestly one of the easiest dishes to make well. You dont even need to do much to them, theyre even delicious raw, as sashimi. The one thing you can do to screw them up is overcook them. And thats what they did.Their drinks were also weak, weak sauce.We decided to cut our losses and head somewhere else for dessert., Absolutely superb place! Great ambiance/decor, exquisite food and service, and, most importantly, it is way better than Lupo Verde (they are super rude, dont ever go there). The drinks were unique and great tasting. Brunch menu hit the spot; perfect for our Sunday morning woes. Natalie, our delightful server, was great. Bloody Mary, something I am very picky about, was beautifully made. We used DC-made gin instead of vodka. I hope the hipsters dont ruin this place*. While we were there for brunch, the bar seems like a perfect place for the end of your 17th Street, Saturday night fiesta. This place will help you deal the deal.* - Hipsters: go to Lupo Verde on 14th Street. I highly recommend it for you., We had a lovely time and a very good meal. Loved the Caesar salad and scallops. The shrimp entree had jumbo shrimp in an interesting sauce. The service was very attentive without being overbearing. Well definitely go back!, Some of THE best French toast Ive ever had with wonderful service in an amazing atmosphere. This restaurant makes me want to stay at the Carlyle. Frech toast was so delicious. Nice and custard-like in the center and tasty toasty on the outside. Coffee was good and hot and continuously topped off by the helpful and friendly staff. Cant wait to come back for more breakfast and lunch and dinner and cocktails., A great restaurant -cozy with great food and great service on New Years Eve. We decided to try their fix menu. The price for 3 course meal was $85 and additional $45 for wine pairing. We decided not to do the wine pairing and ordered bottle of wine. My wife loved her Cosmo and said it was AMAZING. Our service was excellent. Our waiter, Sam, was great. He provided much of his recommendations for our selection. For appetizers, we had oysters, carpaccio, and trout. Carpaccio and trout were excellent. They both melted in our mouth. For main course, my wife and our friend had their roasted chicken. It was HUGE and both really enjoyed it. Our other friend had their NY fillet, was good. I decided to try their famous spaghetti. My sis-in-law raved about it so why not. I expected red tomato sauce spaghetti, but it came out in Alfredo sauce. It was excellent. The noodles were so fresh. The Alfredo sauce was great. Deserts were good. Would I be back? YES!, Spent NYE here and enjoyed from the Pre fixe menu. I had the calamari as appetizer, steak for entree, gelato for desert. I really enjoyed the calamari. It was well balanced, yet bursting with flavor. The steak was good, but nothing to write home about. I didnt like the fries that came with it. It was pretty soggy. I have had better steak. The gelato was ok too. I mostly enjoyed the moscow mule. They make pretty good strong drinks in there. The ambience is swanky. I recall walking in and stating that to my boyfriend., I cannot wait to come back. Not only a delicious experience but the service was outstanding. Unfortunately we were running 20 minutes late for our reservations we were reassured they would hold our table, during the holiday season this was pretty generous. My friend and I split many dishes. Starting with the jalape31o tots that were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I do wish they had a kick to them but still delicious. Next, we had the deviled eggs which the chicken skins were perfectly crisp and made me want more! The stuffed mushrooms were good as well.We ordered and split 2 first course dishes. First the beef carpaccio; refreshing and citrusy. My friend who isnt a huge carpaccio fan absolutely loved it! It was a large plate so there was definitely enough to share. Then out came the saut39ed calamari. Oh the calamari. I think I would go back for just that. In a delicate and flavorful tomato broth, I wish I had a bowl just to dip bread into. The kitchen very kindly split this dish into 2 for us. Finally we finished off by splitting the scallops were were amazing, perfectly crusted on each side and melted in my mouth. Again, the kitchen also split this dish for each of us to enjoy. Overall the food was amazing but the service also made eating here a relaxed and enjoyable experience. The staff works as a team, not leaving the responsibilities to only one server. Our plates and silverware were cleared after before new dishes arrived. Our waters were filled and I truly loved eating here., We came to The Riggsby for an early NYE dinner to celebrate my hubbys birthday and NYE. We were five people, his parents, his sister and two of us. We were sat at a table everyone thought was awesome (I thought it was ok, normal table, didnt understand their hype lol) in the corner of the restaurant, a round booth, you know, where two people have to scoot into the middle. The table was beautifully set, with adorable non-matching bread plates and butter knives, so cute. We sat down, were given the menus and immediately noticed that NYE comes with a prix fixe dinner menu, at $85 a pop. I was not expecting this. I booked our reservation on OpenTable and nowhere said it would be a prix fixe menu...I also went on their website (at the time of booking the rez, early ish December), browsed their standard menu and saw nothing, I went back to it after the dinner and it was promptly displayed, so my guess is they added it in mid-late December. I got a call to confirm the rez 3 days before and the lady mentioned the charge on the credit card if we dont cancel within 24 hours but did not mention the nights special menu. Now, I know its a big night, and perhaps I shouldve expected a prix fixe menu, but weve done a NYE dinner every year for the past 3 years and not all restaurants have the mandatory 3 course menu, so I was still surprised. It wouldve been nice, I thought, if the lady who called to confirm our reservation also mentioned the different menu. But lucky for me, I wasnt the one paying, and his parents seemed cool with it, so moving on!We started out with drinks and they brought us bread and butter. They serve the bread per slice on your bread plate and came around often to offer more, which was great! Yes please! (diet starts in the new year!) The food was absolutely delicious, everyone agreed. There were a few course options for each and everything everyone ordered looked amazing. Heres what I had:- First course: beef carpaccio: very good! Super well seasoned with lemony taste and a ton of baby arugula and capers on top. - Entr39e: NY strip steak and fries: it came with two steak medallions, with some bernaise sauce on top, they were delish! and the fries were good too. - Dessert: goats milk cheesecake: wonderful! YUM! They brought my hubbys dessert with a candle, which was nice, but our poor awkward waiter just placed it in front of him and looked at him. So we all looked around, will anyone sing? Nope, no one around, ok, so I improvised and started singing happy birthday! lol the waiter slowed backed away 2f(334)_/2f The food and the nice ambiance of this fancy place made this a very special evening. Im not sure if its fully worth the $85 price tag not including drinks for the prix fixe, but it was a very nice experience. I want to go back, though, and try their regular menu, which I had extensively browsed and was excited about!, I dont get the hype of this place. Its really overpriced. My appetizer, jalapeno tater tots were delicious but my main course, grilled shrimp was okay. I can make better shrimp at home. Underwhelming experience., Dupont Circle. Not the ultimate destination for the developing food scene in Washington D.C. Especially when a restaurant is situated in a hotel. Rarely do I eat at hotel restaurants and it is even more rare when the food is good and the service is impeccable. The Riggsby obviously destroyed all of my assumptions of hotel restaurants and food scenes in particular neighborhoods.I feel we ordered every bites - including the chorizo stuffed mushrooms. The mushrooms like many reviewers have said are great. My expectations coming into trying them were high and although it didn exceed expectations it met them. The mushrooms were good. I am not sure if any of the other bites were memorable - the crispy chicken skin on the deviled eggs were good but the egg filling was not the best.The chef special chopped salad with the homemade thousand island dressing was good. Different. It had a lot of different textures and things that are typically in a chopped salad like eggs were replaced with another similarly textured food items that I wasn sure what it was. But it is an evolution of the original chopped salad.My main course was the chicken. You get to large pieces of chicken on a bed of a sweet/savory sauce with pearl onions and potatoes. The chicken was amazing until the salty sets in. But it is good even though it was a bit salty.The side of french string beans (I don know how to use the french words that was on the menu) was chock full of garlic and was amazing with the chicken.Instead of putting a basket of bread on the table they have bread service. Water seemed to be filled up always. If I took a sip it was filled momentarily. This was great. The waiter that we had was also fantastic.Overall it is good restaurant. I am pleased to have been able to discover it., Just good. Everything about it is good. A a modern take on mid century. Mad Men could have filmed an episode in this restaurant., Had a really fun dinner at the Riggsby this weekend. I love the decor of the restaurant and the feel of the bar. I would definitely recommend arriving a little early before your reservation to enjoy some fantastic cocktails at the bar. The food was good as well. I loved the deviled eggs and burrata appetizers. As for main courses, the pork was excellent. The burger was good too but I wasnt as awed by it as I was expecting to be. Overall the Riggsby is a great place to enjoy a nice meal or cocktail., I have been to Tico, and didnt have the best time or service, but to the restaurants credit it was VERY new when i went. I tried this place out, and had a very different experience. The seared scallops are mouth watering,and please, please try the strawberry shortcake!!! You WILL NOT REGRET IT!, Have been here 4 times now since it opened last fall (Fall 15) and am waiting for the other shoe to drop, but this place keeps getting better. Quietly tucked in to a boutique hotel off New Hampshire Ave. in DuPont, this place has it all. Bar scene is always lively but approachable. Great wines by the glass, and the bartenders really excel at the often overlooked basics like a Boulevardier or Manhattan. The bar, and the restaurant, feels like it is right out of the roaring 20s. Awesome decor, but not in an artificial way. Dishes are amazing, from the tiny (deviled eggs done right), to the moderate (best ceasar in the city), to the big (Pork dish is to die for in cold weather). One of my favorite spots in DC yet., Went to the Riggsby last night for the first time and had a great time - great food, good vibe, reasonable prices.Arrived around 7pm for an 8:45 reservation hoping that we could maybe either be seated early or try to snag seats at the bar. The former didnt happen, but after waiting for about 10 minutes, two seats opened up at the bar and thats where we ended up dining. The bar (as well as the restaurant) is designed as a supper club and I really liked the cool, casual, yet polished vibe. Our bartender was Alex who was helpful and friendly all evening.Started off with a glass of bubbly for me, a gimlet for my husband, and an order of the chips and green onion dip and deviled eggs. My husband loved his cocktail and my bubbly was great. I really enjoyed the homemade chips, which were crunchy and not greasy at all. The dip was smooth with a great flavor. I also loved the deviled eggs, especially the hint of pepper on top. The filling was really smooth and flavors spot-on.We continued by ordering appetizers - the sauteed calamari and Caesar salad. I didnt try any of my husbands calamari, but he loved it and it looked fabulous. I liked my Caesar (if youre not an anchovy fan, ask for them to leave them off, but they were fresh) which had great parmesean flavors. We decided to split the NY strip filet at Alexs recommendation. It was plenty for two (especially given all of the other food we ate). It came with crispy frites and the steak was cooked beautifully. My husband loved that the bernaise came on the side, which is nice so you can control how much you used.The restaurant was busy all evening, and bar crowds ebbed and flowed. I can see why it is popular! I would definitely return., What a lovely snow day at Riggsby! Bruce was a great host and food was great. Enjoyed half price bottle of champagne....good tip. Will be back!, An excellent bar. The happy hour is terrific, including some classic cocktails like the Nick and Nora Martini and the Nick and Nora Manhattan for $6 each. Traditional glassware adds to the ambience. French fries and potato chips and dip are also very tasty. Bartenders are courteous and knowledgable. One downside is no wifi except for guests of the hotel. The bar will not provide an access code., Being from Jersey, I like to think that I know good pasta. The Fresh Spaghetti flavored with bacon was the Truth!, Lovely atmosphere and top notch service., The Riggsby is really a hidden -- or not so hidden -- gem tucked into a boutique hotel away from the hustle and bustle of Dupont. Its a relatively simple menu of American/new American classics that is executed very very well. The cocktails are properly made and the service strives to be very good. My last dinner here consisted of the delectable deviled eggs and the pork chop. The eggs have a great salty crisp with the chicken skin and nice heat with the chiles. The pork chop is a massive feast. Pork on pork with some sausage, onions, peppers and potatoes. Enough to share just a little. Previously I enjoyed the Holstein Schnitzel. I love the idea of throwing a fried egg on everything/anything. Very good.Desserts have been good. I was not overwhelmed with the goat cheese cheesecake ... but more of a personal preference.The decor and lighting are great. Its like a step back into the 20s or 30s, especially the bar. Its a little late to address, but the noise in the dining room is very, very loud. If you are sitting in the middle of the room prepare to yell across the table. Overall, though, a great addition to the DC dining scene., DC Restaurant Week - Brunch ReviewBefore I begin my review, I have to acknowledge the horror that was Twist, which inhabited this space last year. This was a groupon scam that would not stop. I actually think the Georgetown location is still running...But it was the worst dining experience of my life. So I was so excited when I showed up to a last minute brunch, at the same location, to find that it was Up. Graded. I tried to talk to the hostess about the space, but she and her colleagues were uninterested in engaging us in conversation. I wasnt able to get much information about Riggsby, other than confirmation that they used to be Twist. It wasnt very obvious, because the place was completely gutted and transformed. I wanted to get some information (for my review obviously) but they were being jerks. What I do know is that this is the same owner/chef? as Tico. So this is a professional operation. Which to this I just want to add - this strange trend of Hosts and Hostesses in nice DC restaurants acting bothered by customers... you need to get over yourself or get a new job. You are ruining the first impression, and it damages the hard work that every single other staff person in the restaurant is doing for the customer that you just pissed off. Anyway - take a look at the Riggsby photos - the space is gorgeous. We opted for the restaurant week brunch so I cant speak too much about the general menu. But the food is good enough. One of the appetizer options was a smoothie. Thats pretty unique! So nothing melted in my mouth but its good, solid food with good solid service. I recommend this to anyone looking for a relaxing semi-upscale restaurant experience. I would absolutely come here again for a date or group dinner., I came to this place for brunch during restaurant week after working out all morning so I had an APPETITE. I was ready to chow down on some serious grub, however, my bubbling excitement was met with swift disappointment. To begin - the entrance was so crowded. There were groups of people just blocking the small entrance and cutting each other in line to talk to the hostess. I waited patiently behind one couple only to have another couple cut in front of me and take the next available table. Rude. When we were seated, we were met by a friendly waiter who was energetic and boisterous. We proceeded to order the granola and greek yogurt, deviled eggs, hangover sandwich, the morning after sandwich, and the all american tavern burger. We had a very nice and knowledgable sommelier help us choose a sparkling wine which is a great deal since it was half off. Everything was looking up until.... we actually ate the food. Greek Yogurt- you can really eff this upDeviled Eggs - boring and under-seasonedMorning After Sandwich - good quantity of meat here but forgettable All American Tavern Burger - disgusting. The patty was dry and flavorless, the bun tasted stale. It was akin to eating cardboard. As Donald Trump would say: pathetic, lightweight, or a total loser!We decided not to have the dessert and boxed them to go. The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because the service staff were extremely kind, friendly, funny and knowledgable. The kitchen, however, needs some serious work., My husband took me here for my birthday last night. From start to finish, the service was wonderful!! The whole evening felt like such a treat, with multiple staffers stopping by to wish me a happy birthday. We started off with perfect classic cocktails, then moved on to super-fresh deviled eggs, then shared the schnitzel--which was a delicate and fancy version of one of my husbands favorites--the burger and the incredible broccoli rabe. We finished everything off with a beautiful ice cream sundae. This is how you want to be treated at a restaurant. Thank you!, I wasnt sure if I wanted to like this place. Old school leather seats, huge seemingly out of place chandelier, keyhole shaped entranceway. But I did. Its got a very energetic buzz, an awesome bar area, friendly and attentive staff very familiar with the menu and with a good sense of humor without the airs of most new places, a couple of managers swinging by to make sure all is well. And of course, most importantly, awesome food. It was one of the most enjoyable and friendly and welcoming restaurants Ive been to in awhile! The best of the best:-The lusciously bacon-y spaghetti which I normally would not have ordered because spaghetti as an entree normally wouldnt jump out at me, was a surprisingly complex and spectacular entree. -The lightly smoked trout was just perfect: delicate and not overly salty and not overly smoked (just as advertised), with roasted beets. - I really enjoyed the light deviled eggs with crispy chicken skin and chiles. Just enough to give it the extra oomph! -The cookies for dessert were delicious: slightly crispy on the outside, then soft and chewy inside, with tons of punchy flavor, and nine small, rich cookies in all with three flavors so perfect for sharing. The sardine special for people who dont like sardines: it was good but tasted not like sardines, missing the usual brine. Since I love me some sardines, this wasnt my favorite but itd be perfect for a first time sardine eater. The other dishes (which I didnt try but looked great):-The schnitzel of veal which my dining companion had with a fried egg and capers (he went without the anchovies) was beautifully presented and looked delicious. -Both of my dining companions enjoyed their cream of celeriac soup but I was eschewing the cream so I cant comment. It looked and smelled awesome. I think youve gathered by now that Ill be returning., The multiple hosts and hostesses that manned the hosted station and answered the phone were pleasant, truthful and accommodating as they could be. I had made a reservation on Opentable for prime time on a crowded Friday night but due to circumstances beyond my control, had to call several times to move it. I started off with a drink at the bar (standing room only) while I waited for the table. It was worth the wait- my drink and the table were excellent.I had the Final Frontier cocktail, a bourbon based drink with amaretto, lemon, and cinnamon. I would get this drink again. Delicious and it and other drinks were served in fancy glasses (next time Ill bring a bigger purse- just kidding!!). The place was full of people mostly in the 30-40 year old range. Once seated we were served classic chewy Italian bread. The butter had salt on it. I tried to resist...We had brought our own wine and that went seamlessly. Our waiter (Sam?) brought big glasses out immediately and offered to open the wine. There is nothing more annoying than waiting for the opener or glasses as I have at other places. But not here- Sam was on it! I started with the creamy burrata and it was heavenly! I would get this again despite that, even splitting it, it was filling. I got the bass for my main course. My fish was really good but the skin a little fishy.The Chicken was delicious- big portion as Sam warned. The bourbon pecan pie with extra ice cream was delicious. Thin- not much of the gooey center. Ice cream awesome Overall the place is a little loud but in a good way. There was music but I couldnt really hear it. But it sounded like good music. Valet parking., Im so thrilled that there is another dependable restaurant in the neighborhood. And what a pleasant surprise The Riggsby is! From the atmosphere, to the great service, to the spot-on food, I will definitely be back to try more from the extensive menu. I had the mussels as a first course and the pork as my main course. The portions are very generous. Enjoyed the bar special of the night, too., (4.5 stars) The Riggsby is an excellent spot for dinner with lovely service and a super swanky atmosphere. (It the kind of place I imagine where Howard Stark would hang out.) From the outside and the hotel in which its set, you wouldn imagine it having the decor and jazzy feel it does. Given how classy it was, I was leaning toward getting one of the nicer dishes on the menu. But after seeing how massive the burger was and asking our waiter how it was, to which the response was simply phenomenal, it was an easy choice. It was crazy good, as were the French fries. The sweetness of the bacon-onion jam contrasted the grill flavor of the burger beautifully. The meat itself was juicy and shockingly large. The bun was grilled too and actually added to the burger as opposed to simply being a placeholder. Although it may not seem like the place to get a burger, itl surprise you just how enjoyable it is.Of course we had to get dessert, so we went with the old fashioned chocolate chocolate cake. It was better than most chocolate cakes but a bit too rich for me. It was large enough for two or three to share, and the almonds added some nice contrasting texture. A nice way to cap off the meal but not the best choice if youe not a fan of sweet desserts., Came here for drinks and a snack with a friend during our recent visit from Boston. The decor was really nice. Lower ceilings made it feel cozy and tons of really nice touches. I had a couple gimlets, they were delicious, not too sweet and my friend got some sort of spicy tequila drink that she liked enough to order a second. We also split and order of the burrata. It wasnt the best Ive had but it was a good size and they served some bread with it as well. Everything was reasonably priced. Ill probably stop back on my next visit., I bummed to write a not so positive review of the Riggsby. I had high hopes because the space is so cozy and it just a few blocks from my place. I was hoping it could become a regular neighborhood place. Here was our experience: drinks at the bar are good but pricey. They aren so out of whack with other DC bars, and my general annoyance with DC $15 cocktail is not limited to the Riggsby. But, nevertheless, like many places, they are on the bandwagon of price gouging for alcohol. our table wasn ready for at least 20 minutes after our reservation time. We enjoyed the bar so we weren too bothered by this until... we sat down and were then ignored for at least another 20 minutes. Finally, another waiter came up and apologized for our waiter absence. Apparently, she was tied up, which seemed odd... Like did she just have too many tables? Both waiters were actually super nice so I feel bad faulting them, but it was kind of ridiculous. Drinks also took a really long time to come, with us having to ask twice about where a drink order went. but... The real reason I give the place 2 stars is the food. Maybe my hopes were too high but-everything was just eh if not worse. And wee by no means really picky eaters. The mushrooms with chorizo had zero flavor. I liked the jalape31o tator tots but everyone else thought they should have been described as croquettes (I agree) and were disappointed. I had the bass, which, while cooked well, tasted very fishy. My husband had the schnitzel, which was just ok. The anchovies were a bit much but without them it had essentially no flavor. The potato salad and Brussels sprout sides on these dishes were the best part. For 2 starters, 4 entrees, 8 drinks (dinner for four), we spent almost $300. There is no way I would ever pay anything close to that again for that meal/experience.
74|the-rye-bar-washington|Very nice addition to Georgetown. I come here occasionally for work and typically go to only a few places, however this place was recommended to me. The place is itself has only been open a few weeks and is extremely nice. The bar and seating area are very nice with large seats and couches creating a lounge like atmosphere. There is also an outside seating area which is really nice sits on a stream that runs through Georgetown. It makes for a very relaxing atmosphere and an awesome view.The bartender was a classic gentleman and made sure to introduce himself to all guest at the bar, remember their names and strike up friendly bar conversation. Most people who came here appeared to be business travelers and they all appeared to like the place as well. They have a wide variety of whiskeys as is their focus, but they also had a few interesting rum selections, one of which was an American made rum.. Not nearly as good as the Caribbean stuff, but interesting. They also had Eldorado 21, which brought it home for me. Didnt try the food, but I did overhear a few people remarking how good the potato skins were (apparently they add braised oxtail to them)I really liked this place and judging by the turnout for a place only having been around 3 weeks, I think their gonna do pretty well. Classy place, nice atmosphere, great view, thumbs up., I came here excited by what I had read about its specialty drinks and oak aged cocktails but after a few visits I have accepted that it is unable to deliver on its advertising. Setting aside that a place named the Rye Bar has a tiny, and pedestrian, selection of rye whiskeys to choose from, the cocktails were not particularly well made or tasty. The service was meh. And the bar nuts looked like they came from Costco (who serves Brazil nuts?) It is a wholly adequate hotel bar but has a ways to go before its a destination on its own., While Rye Bar may be a hotel bar, it is a truly great hotel bar: comfortable leather chairs, fantastic service, a quiet atmosphere, and well-made drinks. Posh is perhaps the best description of the Rye Bar which, based on its location within the exclusive Capella hotel, is not too surprising. Thankfully, although I had my fears, pretentious is not a word that describes Rye Bar. Although we were not hotel guests, we did not feel out of place at all and received prompt and friendly service (and I was even wearing sneakers!). Rye Bar is just far enough away from the Georgetown crowds to make the bar almost feel like its in a different part of the city altogether. Sitting with an expertly made sazerac and quietly talking with friends, while looking out over the canals, makes for a pretty relaxing bar experience. One that I hope to repeat soon.Tips: try the warm doughnuts with meyer lemon cream. Sooo good., I finally got a chance to check out Rye Bar and wasnt disappointed. I particularly liked their seating outside along the canal. Its perfect for hanging out after a long work day with low noise level yet able to see all the buzz going on inside.We ordered a few signature drinks including Manhattan and Old Fashion and they were really good. I will definitely go back and try a few more including their food., Expensive, but justified. Excellent bar. Stupendous service. Great drinks. Amazing people watching.The drinks are expensive, but they are very good, you get complimentary bar snacks and the bar menu is solid. If you enjoy knocking back excellent drinks while watching gold diggers and international business folk get their Rolls Royces valeted, in a dark marble lined room, this is the place., This is your Gatsby, your 1920s, your perfectly chilled old fashioned served in the right glass... sleek leather and dark wood, solid deep chairs, white marble, amber, dimmed light, impeccably dressed bartender, interesting mix at the bar. This is not an everyday place, but something that should be taken in small dozes. Rather short, but well thought through bar menu and a great selection of cocktails. No rush., This is a five star place and I am so happy I was able to try it out on my bday.First, a disclaimer, yes, it is a bar in hotel, no it is not cheesy. If you are going to be a snob about hotel bars then stop reading now.Anyways, the bar nuts were nice and spicy and many varieties. The drinks were awesome. The bartenders really know what they are doing. They make an amazing szerac. My boyfriend has lived in NOLA for many years which is the home of the szerac, but the one we had there was able to rival the classic NOLA cocktail. I would highly recommend having a drink or two here. It is expensive, but it is worth it. We sat inside, but there is outdoor seating on the canal. Also, it is a pretty small place, but luckily the crowd rotates quickly enough and you are rotate into one of the huge, plush leather chairs. Enjoy!, The Rye Bar is located in the beyond-swanky Capella hotel, and our entire experience here was top-shelf. Although we were not hotel guests, the bartender greeted us graciously and we received outstanding service, and the most perfect Gin Rickey I have ever ordered. This is not your neighborhood bar. This is where you woo the love of your life as you watch the fireflies light the air over the canal on a warm summer evening, lift perfect cocktails to your lips, and try to forget that soon you will have to return to the real world., Great atmosphere with service to match. The wine list is extensive and their drinks are pretty decent, especially the aged manhattan. The snack manu, while small, is solid especially the crab cake sliders., Great place if you appreciate rye as much as I do., The Rye Bar was so chic we felt at ease once we sat down it was such a pleasing looking bar to get away from the 90F heat. At first we wanted to be outside next to the canal but that was told to us that its for dining only. We didnt mind the bar though it was so comfortable. We ordered 3 mojitos though he didnt have mint he made sure to inform us that he was going to obtain some from another restaurant - thats the difference in service between a hotel such as Capella and others that simply told us they didnt have any and like mojito was out of fashion. The mojito had a nice surprise element of a splash of sparkling water in it made it all the more refreshing! It was $15 a piece but well worth it., Some friends and I went to Rye Bar before seeing a movie at the Georgetown theater, and overall I felt that while the decor and location is great, it definitely needs to work on service.This is a hotel bar, so I think it really has to do itself up in order to get locals to ever come here. The inside is plush and luxurious, with big couches and a very intimate setting. The outside, where we did not actually sit, is right along the Canal and would be great for a nice drink during any season except winter.But looks can be deceiving, and the service was just not up to par. I think there was only one waitress for the entire inside section, but she was naturally overwhelmed. We sat for a good 10 or 15 minutes without even a menu, which is not acceptable. I grabbed a menu from an adjacent table, and we shared it among the party of four. Then the waitress comes over to tell us about Rye Bars drink specials, but we already decided on what we wanted to get without her input. What is the point of a waitress in the first place? So two of us order craft cocktails and the only girl in the group orders a vodka soda - imagine our surprise when the waitress brings out our cocktails and leaves the girl with nothing for a good 10 minutes. Then the waitress says that the bartender was busy and couldnt make a vodka soda, but that makes absolutely no sense. To make the drinks that we were served, you had to zest lines and do all this other involved stuff that is much more complicated and literally putting vodka and seltzer in a cup full of ice.We decided to order the charcuterie board to have a light snack, but when one of the runners came out to serve it, we asked her which meat was which, ...she tried to make things up, but after about one or two meats, she feigned ignorance and said that she would go back to ask and then come back. Then about five minutes later, the waitress comes over and asks everything is okay, and we ask her to explain the meats, ...but she didnt know all them either. At the end of the day, neither of them ever told us the meats that we were eating. For the runner to not even bother to come back after she said she would is really annoying.Anyway, we hightailed it out of Rye Bar because the service was way too slow. The waitress naturally comped the vodka soda, and for good reason. Since my experience was so dependent on a certain server, I dont think thats enough to not recommend going to Rye Bar, since service can be hit or miss depending on the day. The inside decor and location is great, but it definitely has to work on service issues if it wants to be a go-to hang out for locals., The Rye Bar is a classy, low-key bar in the Capella hotel on 31st Street and the Georgetown canal. On Sunday night, my boyfriend and I went to a pre-theater dinner at Il Canale, and crossed the street for a pre-theater drink at Capella.Our bartender Andrew served us two unique cocktails, the Blueberry Ryejito for me and the Vermont Shrub with whistle pig rye for my boyfriend. Despite the tacky name, the Ryejito was great. Comprised of white rye, blueberry and mint, I was surprised by the presentation and versatility of white rye. I would order the Ryejito again on a warm spring or summer day, and opt for the Vermont Shrub for the winter. Andrew is a fantastic bartender, and answered the various mixology-related questions I had, including the history of white rye! Oh, and dont be afraid to ask for something off-menu if you are feeling daring- he comes up with the most fantastic concoctions without a recipe!The Rye Bars atmosphere is one of the best in DC. Low lighting, dark wood paneling, and lush vintage furniture enhance the low-key intimate environment. Capellas staff is noticeably attentive, and are happy to help with any of their guests needs. The Capella bar is not to be missed, but unfortunately it is so much off the beaten path -- or the canal -- that most visitors, especially Washingtonians - who dont explore the cobbled streets of Georgetown and inquire whats inside the well-lighted brick building might just miss the best drink experience theyll ever have., Very elegant high end hotel bar. Havent had the pleasure of staying at the Capella but had two rounds of cocktails inside The Rye Bar. Andrew was a fantastic server and offered great recommendations. The couches are comfy and the bar was nice and quiet. If youre looking for a good drink Ive give this place a try., Excellent bar, wonderful atmosphere. The staff are all great and very accommodating. Angel is the best bartender in all of DC. A great place to meet friends for a drink and snack., Im a huge fan of bars that make a great cocktail. I was a bit disappointed by their barrel aged manhattan. Ive had quite a few manhattans from bars all over the country and this was sub par at best. The price was quite insane as well for the lack of quality at $22 a drink. The vibe was very nice and modern and upscale., My favorite date spot in Georgetown., The Rye Bar is a great place for a t3ate-30-t3ate. Its a dark, intimate space and great waitstaff make it a perfect place for an after work meeting or in preparation for a dinner or a movie at the AMC down the road. My wife and I met there after work and really enjoyed it.The small plates are not to be overlooked. Its seasonal, but their bruschetta and pastas are otherworldly and could stand completely alone at a full restaurant.They serve excellent old fashioneds and martinis. Get one of the latter extra dirty and all your worries will melt away., Rye may have gone up in our estimation had seating been available in the chic bar area. Instead my wife and I were seated on a narrow patio beside a creek--a secluded and potentially romantic spot, except for the Middle Eastern businessman sitting at a table directly behind me who was talking at the top of his lungs on his cell phone to someone we would learn was the daughter of a business associate, and with whom he was apparently involved.YEAH, YOU GOTTA PUT THE PHONE UP TO YOUR FUGGINEAR. YEAH, YOU A WOLF, I A WOLF. WE ALL WOLVES. BUT YOU FREAKING ME OUT! YOU FREAKING ME OUT! YEAH, YOU BEAUTIFUL, YOU MAKE LOVE LIKE A GODDESS. BUT YOU FREAKING ME OUT!And so it went. I thought we might get a reprieve when his sandwich arrived, but on he went between and during bites. YEFF. I WOMM MAKE RUV WITCHOO. YOU A SHARK, ME A SHARK. WE ALL SHARKSHHH. BUT CHOO FREAKING ME OUT!Meanwhile, as my neck was likely being pelted by the occasional partially chewed French fry, my wife and I tried to enjoy two of the signature cocktails. Both disappointed. The Manhattan, mixed and then aged with housemate bitters, had an oddly funky aftertaste. The cranberry gin and tonic was more pleasing, but rather ambitiously priced at $18 for a drink that was half tonic water. All things considered, memorable but not for the right reasons., **update** I reviewed this place while I was still at the bar. As the night progressed, both the bartender and one of the waitresses became frantic. We werent really sure why because the place wasnt exactly swamped. It took about 15 mins for us to get our tab and there was only one other couple sitting at the bar. I left feeling a bit stressed out myself...not exactly a relaxing experience in Gtown. Solid stuffy bar in Georgetown. If youd like a beer they are out of everything but goose island and boddingtons. Middle aged scene with great mood lighting. Also we were pretty sure Rafael Nadal was sitting next to us. Limoncello seems to be popular here for some reason., I did enjoy my old-fashioned, but I found the atmosphere at Rye a bit too uptight and pretentious for my liking. Everyone there looked slightly uncomfortable, including the staff. The drinks are pricy at around $20 each, but I was expecting this, and this wasnt the off-putting part. I might come back here in the daytime and see if the tone is a little more fluid. Definitely an older crowd., This is quite a nice little kept secret rye bar in Georgetown. Ive been 3 times now and each time has been quite fun. It is nestled inside the boutique Capella Hotel, which is quite nice to stay in. Its also is next to their restaurant called the Grill Room... Be forewarned, the drinks here are very expensive. I dont see anything on the menu less than $15. However, if you do chose to get one of their specialty cocktails, they are a treat. The menu changes every season, so I would advise the more seasonal cocktails. A little tip: the bartenders here are exceptionally talented mixologists. I asked them to make me a random vodka cocktail. He served it with a mint sprig in a lemon and it was sooo delicious and refreshing...Anyways, I gave this place 4 stars because the cost is 5 stars, but I wish it was just a tad more lively. A great quiet spot for the night, however....Additionally sitting in the big leather chairs by the bar gives this place a grand feeling. Def recommend for a date night., Good for a cocktail before or after dinner. cool ambience and view! Very small though., The drinks were weak and two mysterious charges came up on my credit card. I called them and the person on the line was dismissive and not helpful., I went here for a special night with a friend, and we stopped by after dinner to grab a drink. We only had one drink so I cant complain about the expensive prices...we knew what we were getting ourselves into. The space is small and intimate, and if you feel like shelling out some cash for a fancy drink in a fancy bar, this will do the trick. It is inside a hotel and there were some nice hotel patrons in the place as well., If you want to visit a bar that practices the real, true art of mixology, this is your spot.I was visiting DC for a few days and yelped a couple bars in the Georgetown area and this seemed like it was worth paying a visit. Sure enough, I was right. The drinks are pretty pricey (~$15 each) but for how carefully and articulately they are hand-crafted, I would say its worth it.My friends and I ordered a hot toddy and it was pretty awesome to watch the bartender make them. My drink felt like a royal concoction: Some whole cinnamon sticks submerged in some whisky, topped a dash of cloves. It was super yammmy, too! My friend ordered a whisky sour and we saw the bartender grab an egg from the fridge and crack it in the drink (uhhh wtf). But, we soon learned that REAL whisky sours come with a dash of egg white to add to the foaminess of the drink. Mindblown*Overall, Id say this place is pretty badass. It is fancy place with a speakeasy type atmosphere. Pair that with some good drinks and good company and youre set. I highly recommend this bar, if youre ever in Georgetown!, This is a fantastic bar tucked away on one of the side streets in Georgetown! The decor is very Old World, dark wood and big leather chairs. Great for a cocktail with friends.We were celebrating a friends birthday and, without prompting, the bar tender acknowledged this and gave her a free glass of champagne. Thanks!The mixed drinks were really good. Our group had the Moral Hazard, Oaxacan Winter, Old(er) Fashioned and The Cure (be warned, it tastes like licorice) and liked them all. They are a little pricey but the perfect place for a celebratory birthday drink!, Dont get me wrong, this is a swank bar located in a beautiful hotel but these doooshy bartenders (aka mixologists) always irk me.Bro, Im already paying $18 for your stupid drink, just be normal.These dudes are one step up from Starbucks baristas.This aint even New York. Pssh, I was supposed to head to the Four Seasons Bar to meet my friends, but got sidetracked with another group of friends at the Rye Bar. Needless to say, I stayed at the Rye bar and it was my second time here. The drinks are good and the crowd is varied depending on the hour of the night. I had a blast here with their decent selection of beer and craft mixed drinks., Im not a huge bar fan, but this one is quite charming. With the beautiful ambiance to the superb mixologist, this is a great spot for a low-key night., Very elegant and fancy place. Good drink and good services. My martini was superb, Beautiful bar. Amazing bartenders who were on top of their game! Sat at they bar and ordered the Older Fashioned. Hands down, one of the better Old Fashioneds I have ever had, so I was impressed.Will definitely be adding to my regular stops when I come back to DC!, Had drinks and appetizers on Saturday 21 May to celebrate our sixth wedding anniversary. The ambience was traditional, soft lighting, upscale, and you had a sense that Ernest Hemingway would be sitting there having a drink with you. The brown leather high back chairs are more than comfortable. We ordered the Rye 75, which was a delicate infusion of sparkling wine, bitters, top shelf Rye, and various other spirits. It was so delicious that we were compelled to order a second round. To compliment our spectacular cocktails, we ordered the cured meats plate, oysters, and finally a deletable burger and fries. The cured meat platter was substantial and delicious. The oysters tasted like someone had just pulled them from the ocean, fresh and Briney. Our mini burger was perfectly cooked and served with shoestring fries. We mentioned to our wonderfully attentive server Frances, that we were celebrating our sixth wedding anniversary. We were presented with a complementary platter of delectable mini desserts, to include mouthwatering homemade Caramels. Frances informed us that the chef was a former White House chef, and the food definitely reflected that caliber of excellence. I highly recommend the Rye Bar, it is definitely pricey but worth the experience., Went here for cocktails for our anniversary. Its pricey, so Id save this for special occasions. Beautiful setting and great intricate cocktails. Very good for intimate conversations., This was a beautiful bar in a beautiful hotel, but I was really turned off by the bartenders attitude. She could not have been more rude my my friend and I. We stayed for one drink and left, because I do not appreciate being treated like I cant afford a glass of wine in your bar when I most certainly can., Wonderful cocktail bar and a rooftop in the evening. Ordered the LastWord with green chartreuse and they nailed it perfectly., Its a hotel bar with a small rye selection. The staff is friendly and the vibe of the neighborhood is fun., We were staying at The Graham Hotel on Thomas Jefferson, one street over from the Rye Bar. and although our hotel promised a roof top bar with DC views, the weather promised evening showers and late night rain. So with a quick scan of yelp, i saw this bar nearby with good reviews and texted our friends the change of plans. sadly i hadnt looked at the menu to see that the drinks were on the very pricey side!that said though, the bar is really nice, swanky leather chairs and a sort of plush smoking lounge feel without the actually cigarettes. the waiters are attentive and friendly, the menu is good by having a nice selection of the classics but a decent selection of different cocktails as well. prices are a bit eye-watering (for me at least) a cocktail for $18 seems extortionate but maybe thats just Georgetown prices?! anyway i enjoyed by cocktail-something like a peach tea, cant quite remember, and the overall experience but i probably wouldnt rush back for a quick drink if i was tight on cash., Initially stopped by on a whim. Service was excellent and cocktails good. Ordered a burgerand whoa! Best burger. Had to come back the next day to make sure it wasnt the cocktails that made it so good. ., Beautiful setting for an expensive drink. Id say this bar is probably best reserved for special occasions. I did not find the servers to have attitude problems as some other reviews suggest. They were helpful and were not pushy about additional rounds. Solid choice., Been in here for 10 minutes and makes me feel like I am in Manhattan. Love it beautiful decor well stocked bar and a Tender that is on his game. Drinks are not cheap so if you are tight dont come here. Can look a bit uppity however keep it real amongst yourself. Bring your wife, girlfriend, jump off or side peace., It a hotel bar. With prices to match. With a name like Rye Bar I expected a decent Old Fashion, but their Old Fashion is less whiskey and more fluff., Love the place, the widest variety of Rye menu ive ever seen ! Nt exactly everything was there thou ! But nice place, the barman really knows whats hes doing and can really give you a good background and differnece on types ! Althou the prices can be a bit softer bur would definitely be there again !, A hidden little secret. There are two bars in the Rosewood hotel. The rooftop bar has a nice view but its not open all year long. They play classic music in the small lobby downstairs. Of course drinks are $$$, As far as hotel bars go, this is a solid option and clearly a cut above the norm. Just look at the pics! Its a sleek and spacious place.The problem is that it is still a hotel bar and feels like one. That means you get slightly generic, staid atmosphere and unnecessarily high prices. As you might expect, the rye list is solid. I had a dads hat white rye, something I have never tried. It was good stuff. Still, I cant imagine feeling pulled back in for more.
75|the-source-washington|This place just opened last week and they have a few kinks to work out, but all in all I would say not bad. Give it a couple more weeks and I think they will have their wait staff trained better. One good intentioned water boy must have asked us about 6 times if we wanted more water. And when we asked the waitress what she would suggest she said everything on the menu is good. Thanks, but that doesnt help us. Everyone was friendly though. It seems uppity but for the most part service was up to par and the food was great. A tad bit on the pricey side but very flavorful and of course the presentation was great! My friend squealed when she saw the little burgers and the crab cakes were very pretty too. Go for the tuna tartar, the steak one isnt as good and the eggrolls were yummy as well. Haven eaten upstairs, but the lounge area wasnt bad. Just expect to pay a little more than the quantity of the food. All in all a good edition to the area., hmm, Asian Fusion? wasn that so two years ago? and by Wolfgang Puck, who has been losing credibility what with the decline of Spago popularity and his catering to the masses? still, he managed to sell me with the Source (right next to the Newseum). i generally skeptical of Asian fusion but it was done really well - portions were not super tiny, it tasted good, and there were definitely unique touches. loved the lamb chops with eggplant, the braied kobe short ribs, and also the appetizer crab cakes. and of course the dessert ($10 a pop) of mango souffle or chocolate purse with caramel spice ice cream.BUT ack! the prices! entrees range from $32 to $60. i would mainly recommend the upstairs dining room as more of an occasion place, unless you are okay with regularly paying $38 for your main course.note: reservations are needed for the dining area upstairs but not for the lounge downstairs (menus are different with lounge being more pizza and pasta). the price difference is also at least $20 and the food is diff.next time, going to try the lounge and see how it measures up..., I knew the prices were going to be high, so I really, really wanted to love this place. I didnt get my wish.The ambiance is just so-so. Its a fairly cool-looking space -- very little lighting, minimalist, clean lines -- but it lacked some focal points, decor-wise. I would have liked to see some funky art to make me feel like I was in a really cool space worthy of the $350 my group of four was about to spend. The crowd was well dressed.The chefs sample of Szechuan green beans was extremely tasty but unoriginal. The tuna tartare appetizer was fresh and delicious. The curried prawns were very good, but maybe $20 good, tops -- not $30 good. My husband got the Szechuan beef filet, and it was extremely tasty -- but again, totally overpriced. The wine list was extensive. Portions -- except for the suckling pig, which was tiny -- were decent.Another thing we noticed is that they seem to still be working out the kinks from a recent opening. (We asked and learned they opened six weeks ago.) Three times before we even ordered, a cadre of waiters came to our table with plates in hand, only to be physically pulled away and redirected by a manager (I assume) who knew the plates were meant for a different table. Our entrees arrived and we all started eating before one of us realized that the entrees were all missing the rice they were supposed to come with. The rice showed up a few moments later. On the other hand, our servers were all extremely polite and had commendable knowledge about the menu.Bottom line: The wait staff will hit its stride eventually, but the food will need a *serious* injection of inventiveness if it is ever to merit those silly prices., Well MERCI Monsieur Puck!! The Source is without a doubt the best food Ive ever put in my mouth, period. Id gotten a $250 gift cert at an auction and decided to give his new restaurant a whirl, and now Im going to have to refinance my house so I can eat dinner there every night of the week. It is THAT good. Truthfully I was not impressed with Spago or Pucks frozen pizzas, so I wasnt expecting all that much from The Source. WOW is the only word that really accurately describes this place. The decor is stunning...sort of like Calvin Klein minimalism meets fancy hardwoods and MoMa design schemes. Youll feel like a celebrity just walking in the door. We were seated upstairs, and noticed the 2-story glass wine cellar as we ascended. The amuse bouche was a dish of spicy green beans with sesame seeds... fellow green veggie haters unite, because this will make you want to eat green beans every single day. We ordered two pork appetizers that were phenominal, and our waiter was well-versed with the menu and made great recommendations. For dinner we ordered two entrees. The flat iron steak, which was more tender than any filet and more flavorful than any NY strip Ive ever had! The lamb chops were out of this world - superbly grilled, perfectly seasoned and came with a fabulous mint chutney. Again our waiter came through as our sommelier, recommending the perfect wine pairings for our dishes. For dessert we had a trio of gelato, all three flavors were outstanding. From the decor to the waitstaff to the food, The Source is amazing. The ONLY downfall is the price - dinner for two with wine and apps came to $300. However, its completely worth it. Try The Source for a special occaison or a stellar first date - its very impressive and set up so that no matter where you sit youll get an intimate feel and can actually talk. Id give it ten stars if I could!, I went here on Thursday night for happy hour. If I was paying from my own pocket I dont think Id choose to come here. But thankfully, I wasnt. The decor was actually pretty cool, in my opinion. It has a nice, open feel, and I really like the bar set up. I just had a couple drinks, and we all shared some appetizers. It was nice that the chef brought us out 4 mini, mini-burgers made with kobe beef. They were very tasty and probably the best thing I had there. The General Tsos chicken wings were pretty good, with a nice hint of spice. I also liked the onion rings as well - theyre very thinly sliced. While the food was great, and the ambiance pretty nice, my problem was with the service. The bartenders were just too busy and it took way too long to put in an order. Also, the prices are probably too high for the offerings.Overall, not a bad place, especially if someone else is paying., Thank you Wolfie! Albeit a bit expensive, The Source has definitely been added to my DC top 5 list. The atmosphere is nice and very hip and it is not too loud. The service has been amazing on all 3 of our visits so far. The servers are knowledgeable, well trained and friendly. I dont personally care how Asian Fusion is not a new concept. No one in DC does it quite right so I welcome a GOOD Asian fusion restaurant. The food is really top notch...and the portions are generous...you are definitely not going to leave hungry! Instead of bread, each table receives a small bowl of spicy stir fried green beans with carmelized walnuts to share...delicious! For starters, weve loved the lamb lettuce cups, the tuna tartare cones, the suckling pig, the chicken salad and especially the tiny dumplings of pork belly with black vinegar...delicious! For entrees we loved the spicy prawns (and yes...this probably is the spiciest thing on the menu and it is in fact spicy...love how you can get it with brown rice!) , the diver scallops, the chicken with sausage fried rice, the absolutely divine short ribs, the lamb chops, and the steak au poivre. The desserts are amazing as well. We especially loved the cookie plate (big enough for a table of 4 to share for a little something sweet) and the chocolate phyllo dessert.We love the wine list and the sommelier Malia is awesome. The wine list is California heavy which we greatly appreciate instead of French heavy as are most restaurants in the DC area. She is friendly, down to earth and entertaining and has picked spectacular wines for us to match the food and our taste. Havent tried the downstairs lounge area yet, but am eager to eat down there on a future visit., What do you get if you cross a California Pizza Kitchen with a Park Hyatt? Yeah, thats right....this restaurant. You knew that was coming. I went to an event here last week. The decor is stylish, with glass panels, high ceilings and subtle spot lighting. Floor-to-ceiling wine bottles as room dividers. Modular furniture. Lots of clean lines. A gorgeous dining room hostess dressed in black, with a stylish Beckhamesque platinum bob. The finger food was pretty tasty, with these adorable little Kobe beef sliders, the original California-style pizzas (CPK!) and some sugared sesame cones filled with tuna tartare, the last of which was mealy-textured and felt macerated rather than chopped. Really crappy tuna. The thing that grossed me out and kind of put me off for the whole event was the fact that the taps in the upstairs bathroom didnt work. So my finger-food was covered in trace amounts of urine and hair grease and whatever people do in the bathroom. I know I didnt wash my hands--I couldnt--so I doubt anyone else found a way to either, and that really, really put me off for the rest of the night. On a more general note, I tend to really dislike Asian fusion. Especially when its kind of like Jean-Georges Vongerichtens Spice Market, where Asian fusion just means taking stuff I can get in Singapore for $2, smallerizing the portions and making the presentation vertical, and then charging me $27. Apparently fusion just means taking traditional recipes and fuuusing them with a high price tag. One day, when Im feeling expensive and frivolous, Ill try the food at The Source but seriously...GENERAL TSOS CHICKEN? So take my review with a grain of salt because Ive already kind of written this restaurant off in my head., A pharmaceutical rep was sponsoring a dinner last night. I usually skip these things, which involve listening to a 45-minute lecture and choosing from two or three entrees on a set event menu... but this one promised to let me order off the menu at The Source in exchange for listening to 3 minutes of why their new antihistamine kicks all the other antihistaminesasses. They had me at order off the menu.First, staff was attentive, offering to take our coats while we waited for our table (which took about 10 minutes for them to secure, even though it was only 6:30pm on a Wednesday and the reservation was made over a month ago). Wait staff was also attentive and knowledgeable.We started with wines by the glass (extensive list to match the walls of wine that decorate the restaurant) and some delish appetizers: tuna tartare in a sweet crispy sesame cone (this married sweet and salty perfectly, and was my favorite), steamed pot stickers, and lobster-filled rolls that tasted similar to pot stickers... all were excellent.For the main course, my friend and I decided to split two so as to gain Maximum Exposure (in capital letters) to the food here. I ordered the Kobe NY steak (medium rare), and she ordered the flash-fried whole sea bass. The steak was obviously flavorful and not nearly as tender as I expected (but I believe this was simply the cut of beef, since NY strip is known for flavor at the expense of tenderness). It was good, but I wouldn get it on my own dime (about $64, and served without any side dishes -- just a steak on a plate with a touch of garnish). The sea bass was amazing -- flash-fried and *extremely* crispy, infused with the aromatic ginger and cilantro that they stuff into the scores before frying, and only made more delicious with two sauces (one sweet, and the better one slightly spicy but still sweet). And the best part: they filet it for you tableside, so you don have to deal with the head and tail yourself! This one I would go back for!Dessert included a pane cotta (wonderful) and a chocolate purse (molten chocolate cake with a twist -- baked into a crisp phyllo purse), also wonderful. Overall, I really enjoyed the food and experience here. I would give 4.5 stars if I could, but I can bring myself to grant that coveted 5th star since we were seated late and the pricey entrees came with nothing on the side. But I really did enjoy The Source, and plan to return soon to try the salmon and the Kobe ribs...., Tyler Cowen recently wrote that this was the second best restaurant right now in DC (He ranks CityZen as numero uno) -- and a couple of friends had been and really enjoyed it -- so I thought it was worth checking out.The menu online looked amazing. So I have to admit that I was a little disappointed to learn that the actual menu does not include all of the items included on the website. Our meal included the following:- The complimentary Szechuan Green Beans -- served cold, quite good.- Tiny Dumplings of Pork Belly with Black Vinegar -- the black vinegar was a bit too dominant, but still very good/excellent.- Scallop & Shrimp Sui Mai -- I must confess that I am not a huge Sui Mai fan, these were very good (but didn change my opinion on Sui Mai).- Wok Fried Whole Sea Bass, Yuzu Ponzu or Spicy Thai-Chili & Fragrant Herbs -- they do filet it table side -- it was excellent, but really would have been enhanced if it was served with a little Asian cucumber salad or something. A whole fish with nothing else just gets a bit tired by the end -- it could have used some crunch or a complimentary flavor -- just a little something would have really made this memorable.- Kobe Short Ribs, Slow Cooked, Indian Spices, Masoor Dal -- good, but lacked a little focus.Staff were friendly and seemed genuine, service was good but not without some lapses. I like the space -- nice atmosphere, but the noise from downstairs lounge certainly does make its way to the dining room.Decent selection of wines by the glass -- and not sure if it was that they initially forgot to bring me my wine, but was a generous pour (maybe 5.5 ounces).I would return, though it is certainly not a great value -- and at these prices ($78 for a glass of wine, an appetizer and an entree with tip) there would be other restaurants ahead on my list -- but certainly worth a visit. The next trip I might be inclined to opt for a couple of drinks and the small plates downstairs., i only had drinks and food at the entry level bar and lounge. the first impression was that this place to LOUD/NOISY. the noise level felt like at a Who concert. it was close to impossible to ask the door people for a seat or hear what they were saying. after that thought (not that it actually got quieter) things turned better. the staff was really nice. they let the two of us sit at a table that could have easily sat five. the wine list was/is impressive and you can get some good wine for a reasonable price (although you can also go overboard, if you like). the food was great. the kobe beef mini burgers were great, the asian chicken wings were just right, and the hummus was only topped by the olive paste. i have to say though that my highlight of the evening was the ginger mojito, i havent had a drink this well mixed anywhere else in DC. for the lounge i wish they would make the room a bit less noise (maybe use some carpets and room dividers). but the food and drinks at the bar certainly make me look forward to a visit to the restaurant., I would actually give this 3.5 stars if I could, but alas.I thought the food, while pretty good, was vastly overpriced for what it was. The little green bean amuse bouche was delicious. For appetizers, we got the char (which was incredible, Im not a big fish fan but I devoured every bite of this, the cardamom raita was stunning) and the tuna tartare (which was good but not as great as most reviewers thought, the flavor of the crust overpowered the tuna). For entrees, I actually got two more appetizers, the tiny pork dumplings and the suckling pig. The suckling pig wasnt that great; it was on the dry side and it just didnt have much flavor. The tiny dumplings were great, but still, not much better than dumplings you can get at a lot of Asian restaurants for less than half the price. My boyfriend got the lacquered duck, which I had some of. The duck was ok, but super fatty. It came with chow fun, which at first taste was delicious until you noticed how very oily it was. The kind of oiliness that sticks around in your mouth for awhile after you finish eating it. We didnt get dessert and the service was solid, if unmemorable. I have no problem paying a lot of money for great food and going to expensive restaurants, but I really dont think this one was worth it to the point where Id want to go back., This is currently one of my favorite restaurants. As this is a restaurant review, Ill limit myself to a few central reasons to love it: Food. The food here is tremendous. I would give the bar level food 3.5 stars, because it nothing special. I would however give the dining room food five stars because it divine, unique, uplifting, and savory. Decor. I always find myself wanting to go here. The atmosphere is great; if youe at the bar level the space is airy and clean, and the larger communal tables are a distinct feature which just may encourage you to meet some new people in a town full of ill ignore you ause im cool. The restaurant upstairs is very well laid out; i just feel like I am eating in a cool California type place. It simply a breath of fresh air from a town with one too many chains and steakhouses. People. Lots of pretty faces to look at while youe eating. The bar seems like sort of a scene (think Cafe Milano) in a neighborhood without many scenes. So again it a welcome change. Wel see whether the opening of the Newsuem overruns it with tourists, hopefully not, Reasonably priced for lunch. The atmosphere is awesome. The service was somewhat slow, but very enthusiastic., The service was so bad that for us, last night,(8:30 on Saturday) it could not make up for how great the food was. We sat there 40 minutes with just water, the wine took that long. The food was amazing, but there are other good options in DC. Maybe if we lived downtown or got down there more often, we could sit at the bar and eat and just prepare ourselves for the wait. For a special event, skip it, you might be talking more about the the service and less about the food., A good effort, but by no means a home run.A stylish Asian fusion restaurant is certainly welcome in the conservative DC scene, but for these prices, and with that pedigree, I expected a little more. We had the 7 course chef tasting menu in the upstairs dining room, and left full, content, but not wowed.The Good. Service - the service was terrific. From the gracious hostesses, an attentive server, informed runners, and a theatrical wine pouring, the service was great all-around, and refreshingly unpretentious.Presentation - all the dishes were plated beautifully and served with a decorous touch.Innovation - Asian-inspired fusion cuisine seems a little New York -- circa 1995; alas that makes it cutting edge DC in 2008. However, the chef gets credit for drawing upon a wide range of influences (Indian, Thai, Chinese) and creating truly interesting combinations.The Bad.Relevance. When any new thing (be it a gadget, a fashion or a dish) is invented, one must ask what is the point of the creation. Certainly the dishes were creative, but I was often doubtful that the all preparations or seasonings helped the dish. In my opinion, randomly throwing microgreens and dashes of 5-spice powder onto multiple dishes demonstrates an unthoughtful shortcut attempt to be trendy and fusion. The microgreen garnishes were rarely strong or crisp enough to contrast with the rich meats or heavy sauces. And I just couldn understand the point of adding pinches of unincorporated 5-spice straight onto the plates -- this is a very potent seasoning, that works best when simmered into the essence of a dish. A small dash goes a long way in a giant of stew, so to leave that same amount in a tapas-sized portion overwhelms one nose and interferes with the already complex combination of flavors on each dish. (In general, each dish suffered from about 2-3 too many too-strong sauces/flavorings). It seemed it raison dtre was merely to shout at the diner Look! I exotic! So, while the chef certainly shows off a broad bag of tricks, it not obvious that any clear style emerges, or any signature dish that will influence the wider Asian-inspired culinary genre. Ie, there is no black cod miso that launched a thousand spinoffs. Case in point - the mini calamari in Thai chili sauce. This tasted sadly just like the cheap fried noodles with duck sauce that come with your average Chinese takeout - there was no reason or purposes for this dish. And why someone would drown crispy little calamari rings in such a thick sweet glaze only makes sense if the chef ran out of new sauces because he put 3 too many on each of the 4 prior courses.Fusion Inchoate. My biggest complaint with the style of preparation was that it was Western protein with a hodgepodge of Asian toppings, almost like a kid gone crazy at the sundae bar. The beauty of so many of the original Asian dishes is a flavoring/seasoning that is fully married into the meat, such that the meat itself is subtly transformed. With the arctic char, the suckling pig and the lamb chops, the meat - while cooked to the perfect heat and texture, was just so plain. One really had to work hard to combine the flavors of the meat and the sauce as you ate it. It just shouldn take so much effort and imagination on the diner part for the flavors of a dish to combine.Decor. I understand where the Source is trying to go with its inimalistdecor, but minimalism (over since the turn of the millenium, at any rate) without a strong design or purpose just looks boring. The dining room upstairs looked look the half-renovated on-premise restaurant of a national chain hotel, whose standard issue artwork and flowers were delayed in shipment. A richly sensuous Spice Market feels so much more de rigeur these days, and the dazzingly white and spacious Zaytinya is a better execution if you want to stick to the 90 minimalism, but the Source (along with other places like Harry Tap Room, BLT steak, Central) suffer from a distinct lack of inspiration, like they were all appointed from the Banana Republic Outlet of restaurant furniture. To borrow from Project Runway -- there was just no point of view.The Ugly.Music. Who on earth thought it was a good idea to pipe in their older brother party mix tape from the 80? Pink Floyd, Van Morrison, U2 and other rock favorites from the dorm party / Bennigan set serve only to distract and irritate the diner. At $40/entree, Puck should be able to afford to commission his own soundtrack. But if he wants to save money, even one of those Putamaya world music CD from any corner Starbucks would be a vast improvement over the completely thoughtless playlist., OVERPRICED! I love trying new places and will spend money for a good overall dining experience but Source just doesnt match up to what it is charging. I tried it for dinner first. The space is interesting and the service was good. The portions of food are VERY small and pricey! While I would say the food was good, I would put Source on par with Proof, Westend, Blue Duck, etc - all of which are more affordable and more filling (and I am a pretty little person). I went back to try eating in the bar downstairs and really walked away with the same feeling - I could have had a full sit down dinner at many of my favorite places (Bourbon, Old Glory, Tacklebox, etc) for much less than the bar at Source. It just isnt worth it in my opinion!, After letting the hype and the crowds die down about the new Wolfgang Puck restaurant in DC, I finally got to experience The Source on a Tuesday night. Although reservations werent made to eat in the hoity toity dining area upstairs, the greeting was prompt and we were told that we could choose any open table in the lounge area.Our server was on the ball, we didnt wait at all and she was super friendly. Drinks were excellent... Ginger Mojitos, oh yah! Mildly sweet and a bit of spice - the perfect summer drink!Now for the good stuff: Mini-Burgers, Pizza and Fries!!!Kobe Sliders - Matchbox, you have some real mini burger competition! The meat melts in your mouth and the mini, sesame seed topped buns, were perfectly toasted.Pizza - good, but not as good as I expected. Sorisso still has the best for me, but WPs had a delicate crust with real buffalo mozzarella, tomato sauce and fresh basil. Finally, the Fries! Oh my, these fries rival Les Halles frites.... which are my favorite in the DC. I wont give the Source first place until Ive gone a few more times and make sure theyre consistent. But no worries Les Halles, Ill still eat your frites... youre much more affordable!, omg. this place was BANGIN i was stoked to finally go. i sent a co-worker right after it opened and he said there were a few mistakes, but not on my go. i had the veggie option (of course) which consisted of an app-a-teaser of veggies in a hard crepe-like shell and a noodle dish with some awesome seasoned tofu.others had: rockfish, i think crab and halibut (just for the halibut as he said)dessert were so-so, but who needs a dessert when the entrees were so awesome., I meant to review this place earlier, but absolutely forgot! I guess that kind of speaks to the experience....Anyways, I came here with two co-workers for a working lunch (gotta love the working lunch). We were all very excited to try the new restaurant, as we had heard good things.The ambiance of the restaurant is very cool. We sat upstairs where there is lots of glass and light. Our waiter was absolutely fabulous; my boss had tons of questions as he is very food-curious and our waiter was very accomodating. Our appetizers were very good. We had several, the sui mai, lamb lettuce cups, and the tiny dumplings. But the main course was pretty much a big snore. Two of us had the Maine Lobster Club (which came highly recommended from other co-workers) and it wasnt that great. We agreed that there was something really off with that walnut bread. Our other friend had the kobe burger, which he said was good. I dont think our main courses really blew any of us away.For dessert, I had the Banana Brulee Tart. It was really interesting! I love creme brulee, and while this was a tart, it was still easy to taste the creme brulee flavor. I would probably go back to The Source, but I certainly would hate to pay for it out of my own pocket. Its incredibly expensive and the food is not that memorable., One would think any restaurant in Washington, DC would know the meaning of a power lunch. Not so. While the food, ambiance, and natural light were worthy of 5 stars, the service -- when we actually got it -- was rather disappointing. Dont expect to eat lunch in less than 90 minutes., post modernist design... straight lines.. dimmed lights..music..just bubbling below the water surface... a well mixed cocktail.. light banter at the bar... a few more cocktails... did I notice a t.v screen..... time melts away.. forever twilight... nice mix of folks in the space.. some with wisps of grey... others considerably younger.. the food looked tasty.. ordered from the bar menu.. lovely personal pizza.. flavorful.. well done.. left into the rain.. feeling pretty good.. a nice well made drink.. good service.. nice ambience... smooth and sophisticated...., The Source was able to wow me with their entrees, which I consider the most important part of a meal. Thus, it gets my 5th star. The fact that they gave us complimentary tuna tartar for my fiancee birthday definitely helped their cause too.American Style Kobe Short Ribs, Slow Cooked, Indian Spices, Masoor Dal = amazing!Ie had my share of good short ribs from eating kalbi and kalbi-jim over the years but this dish takes over as my favorite short rib dish of all time. Short ribs were super tender and the flavors were spot on. The ribs by themselves are great as is but it placed on top of Masoor Dal and it makes the dish even better. My fiancee got the Pan Roasted Rockfish, Red Thai Curry Shrimp, Pineapple Sambal. Another excellent dish. The rockfish was super fresh and it was cooked to perfection. The top layer of the fish was caramelized somehow and it added wonderful texture to the dish. It was one of the best fish dishes in recent memory. The appetizer and dessert were very good too but it paled in comparison to the main dishes.Crispy Tempura Calamari, Jalapeno, Cucumber, Ginger Vinaigrette:The sweet cucumbers went well with the calamari. We wished there were more cucumbers.Spicy Tuna Tartare, Sesame-Miso Cones, Shaved Bonito, Tobiko:One of their signature appetizer and I could understand why. It served like a hand roll and what makes the dish is the Sesame-Miso Cone. Very crispy and unique. A minor complaint about the dish was that the miso flavor from the cone conflicted with the sauce that was used for the tuna. The Source also provided complimentary string beans and candied walnut appetizer to all patrons that night. I really enjoyed the slight spiciness from the string beans. Warm Chocolate Souffl39, Whipped Cr38me Fra3eche, Chocolate Sorbet :We would have loved it if the souffle was a bit darker. We both agreed we like Roy souffle better.Blueberry Almond Crumble, Vanilla Salted Streusel, Ginger Ice Cream:Ginger ice cream did not go too well with the crumble flavors. The Asian theme failed here for me but the crumble itself was good.The service was good as expected from a high end restaurant. We ordered mostly from what our server told us as their signature dishes and he was spot on about the entrees. His recommendation for the wine with the short ribs was excellent also. Wine by the glass come out in a separate miniature carafe and it is quite big.I would definitely go back for a special occasion meal here., When I first heard of The Source, images of Chinois on Main floated in my head. It probably my favorite restaurant (located in Santa Monica) and it a Wolfgang Puck does Asian eatery. If you find yourself in Santa Monica, you must go there.Alas, The Source wasn quite as spectacular as Chinois on Main. The menu is so delicious-looking, but the cuisine did not live up to the menu. Food is designed as appetizers or small plates, and entrees. It mainly Chinese-influenced, although other Asian countries are represented as well. We tried the pork belly dumplings, scallop and shrimp sui mai, lamb lettuce cups, and crab cakes to start. The pork dumplings were by far the best and the accompanying black vinegar sauce was spectacular. While all the starters were solid, they were missing that je ne sais quoi that makes your meal great. Ie had better dumplings at my favorite Dim Sum joints.Our main entrees were also disappointing. My mom ordered the Wok Fried Whole Sea Bass, Yuzu Ponzu, Thai-Chili & Fragrant Herbs, which looked nice but was molested and destroyed by the guy who was in charge of deboning it at the table. It wound up pretty bland and the accompanying sauces couldn salvage the fish. My father and boyfriend split the Grilled Double Cut Bone-In Prime Beef Rib Chop For Two with Gai Lan, Garlic Chives, Wasabi-Armagnac Peppercorn Sauce, and Pan Fried Noodles. It was also bland, which seemed nearly impossible. Nothing but the noodles really screamed Asian, and the noodles were very greasy with a burned taste. I wouldn recommend this one.I ordered the Lacquered Chinese Duckling, with Lo Mein Noodles, and Blood Oranges. It was Peking Duck... plain and simple. It was good- the crispy skin was very yummy and the duck was moist, but it wasn outstanding. I would have preferred a more traditional presentation with buns, green onions, and hoisin sauce -it kind of weird just to eat the Peking duck plain. The accompanying lo mein is too aggressively flavored to combine well with the duck. Desserts were similar to all other foods... good, not great. My dad loved his carrot cake, but I just thought it was on par with our whole meal... ok, not fabulous.What really tipped the scale from very good to good was the service. Our waitress was great, but there appears to be a very inexperienced staff. As I mentioned, my mom fish was assaulted tableside by some novice. Another guy repeatedly cleared plates while we were still eating the food on it! The first time he took away our complimentary green beans we let it slide, but when he did it again with our appetizers, we had to quickly exclaim, Wee still eating that! Weird.If I came back, I stick to small plates, but overall it was a bit disappointing. The menu made it sound like heaven, yet the experience fell short., Im not usually a Wolfgang Puck fan because I like my asian food cheap and gritty - but he did a great job with The Source. Got the roasted suckling pig appetizer and thai style salad. Pig was melt-in-my-mouth awesome. The Thai salad was less peanut-y than expected but a nice mixture of flavors. Oh...and the coffee. YUM! I dont drink coffee often but if this was more accessible...(not 3000 miles away) I might be converted. Must find out what kind of coffee they use/brew., The service was perfect and the food was amazing..We ate the a pork appetizer which melted in the mouth...The Kobe beef with Dal Makhani was a great.. Highly recommend to celebrate a special occasion., One of my favorites in Washington - good food, great wine list. Short ribs are excellent.It is located in the Newseum.The room can be a bit loud, so if youre looking for a quiet spot, its not here. But the food is quite good., I had been wanting to try the Source for a while, then my parents came to town and it was close to my birthday, so I asked them to take me to celebrate. Its a pricey place and an appropriate place for a special occasion so it was the right time to go. The atmosphere is sophisticated and modern with a few retro-chic touches (like the light fixtures). The space was more intimate in size than I expected (after seeing pictures) which was nice. We sat on the second floor which was more quiet than the more laid back bar downstairs. Our table was flanked by two couch/benches that were very comfortable. We has a lack luster view toward Judiciary Square, not an ugly view, but not fantastic either. WOW, the food was amazing! I tried the duck which was cooked to perfection and had a sweet, crispy skin that was incredible. I highly recommend it. My family seemed to all really enjoy their dishes, too. Desert was not that great. My mom got the chocolate mousse which was nasty, no one liked it. I got the chocolate cake which was pretty good, but not that amazing. My dad got the ice cream sampler. The vanilla one was amazing! If you get a desert while there, get that one.Service was great too, and over all we had a 5 star experience. It was a great place to have my birthday dinner! Ill be back next time I have an excuse to!, I have been to Source twice and both times sat at the bar.I went to the Source for the first time in Dec 2008. I had the Kobe sliders and quite a bit of saki. They have a great selection and I remember enjoying it so much that I kept ordering more. That said, I wasn blown away by my standard sliders. When the Source won the Rammy for best restaurant, I really though the RAMW was really getting caught up in the Wolfgang Puck hype. On my second trip I indulged in a smorgasbord of dishes and some made to order cocktails on an early Saturday evening. The entire staff is so charming and talkative, you wish they could take a seat and hangout with you. Pete the bartender got creative and made me a cantaloupe cocktail and then a cucumber cocktail. I felt very sex in the city with my martini glass and it was a nice personal touch. The service and presentation here is top notch.As for food, I had the American Style Kobe Sliders with Smoked Onion Marmalade (much better this time!), the Organic Chicken & Wild Mushroom Dumplings with Shishito Peppers and the margherita pizza. The dumplings were exceptional and the sliders have a combination of flavors best described as a mini gourmet American barbecue in your mouth. In my experience, the crowd is a bit older and more sophisticated compared to most places. Obviously, the newly graduated twits can afford this place unless they are packing mom and dad credit card and some refined tastebuds. I appreciate the lack of riff-raff since I see enough of that in my own Arlington neighborhood. I would definitely go back to the Source for a delicious meal or to the bar to just enjoy the chic atmosphere. It would be a great place for a special night and well worth the price tag., Psssssstttt!!!! Want a great place for fabulous lunch. You got The Source! Check out the Tiny Dumplings with scrumptious pork belly and the scallop and shrimp shu mai to start. The Japanese Glazed Salmon Salad is a joyful palette of primary colors with the wonderful, complex flavors of Japanese pickled vegetables. My friends are sworn suspects who love the Kobe burger. On one occasion, I had the pan-roasted chicken. Its sausage fried rice reminded me of New Orleans but only this side of the Yangtze and that side of ol Miss... The Rockfish is among the one or two best I ever have eaten. And while the prices are not inexpensive, you can shop the menu and get wonderful value for fabulous food. Wolfgang and Scott we love you!, Modest portions, stellar options, gorgeous scene, great location. The Source is a winner.I ate there (expense account) on 5/19/09 - Chris Matthews was there! I used opentable.com to secure a reservation, and it was an easy process.THE SPACEModern. Open. Lots of glass and light colors. Mod right-angle furniture. The bar was spacious, with plenty of open seats around 6:30 on a Wednesday. There are loveseats and chairs in open spots surrounding the bar area.THE DRINKS$15 per cocktail. They make their own simple syrup and sour mix there. I had a drink with blueberry vodka and fresh sage leaves that was excellent.A half bottle of some oddly-named variety of Chateauneuf du Pape was about $42. It was just ok.THE FOODTried the Crispy Suckling Pig.. appetizer. There were three domino-sized squares, that looked sort of like petits fours, that were served. They were good but not great. We also tried the Spicy Tuna Tartare and it was OUTSTANDING. Probably the best thing we had there. For entrees, we tried the Kobe Short Ribs and the Grilled Lamb Chops. The ribs came in a silver bowl and were inishedtable-side. They were falling off the bone and had good flavor. The large lamb chops were a bit charred and overcooked for my taste. I wouldn order the chops again but would recommend the short ribs.DESSERTSWe took Yelpersadvice and went for the ice creams. My faves were (1) 50 Bean Vanilla; (2) Espresso Chai; and there was a tie for (3) Ginger; and (3) Strawberry Rose. The intense vanilla ice cream puts all others (except Amy exican Vanillain Houston) to shame. I not such a vanilla fan, but this was pretty special.The verdict: it #10 best in DC, according to Washingtonian Magazine, and the title is well-deserved. Don go if youe poor, or youl end up washing dishes.I recommend., Very trendy and pricey place. Good service, clean place and bathrooms, food was above average but nothing to go crazy for. Would suggest as a good starting place as the bar is awesome - maybe apps - but entrees left me wanting more., Went again, and was equally impressed. This time, for starters, we took the kobe ribs in korean bbq sauce, daikon hot lobster roll, and whole softshell crabs fried and served with a grainy wasabi tasting mustard. All fantastic, especially the short ribs. We both had the duck, as good as the first time around!The real standout was a passion fruit cheesecake with a dollop of creme fraiche and a raspberry coulis. Quite possibly the best dessert I have ever had., ***1/2 Choosing a business lunch spot near the office is tricky business when the boss is coming along. His taste in restaurants is unpredictable, so I was taking a bit of a chance when I suggested we take a 10-minute walk from our building all the way down to the corner of Penn and 6th where The Source is located. Ie been hearing good things about The Source and its ranking high up in the Washingtonian Top 100 had piqued my interest for some time. Our 12:30 lunch reservation was easily accommodated (a sign of the down economy?). The menu had many appealing Modern American options, with Asian influences. I was somewhat disappointed by the absence of simple starter salads and/or soups - most of the first courses were really appetizers, and fairly expensive ones at that. Following the bosslead, I started with the Asian Dumplings, which were very good, but still don hold a candle to real dumplings purchased in NYC or SF Chinatown for a buck or two. Just so I didn go into a carb coma later in the afternoon, and at the suggestion of our server, I had the Spicy Thai Chicken Salad for my entree. The chicken was finely chopped (almost to oblivion) and despite my misgivings when it was placed in front of me, actually worked well. The salad was fine, with good flavors, but not extraordinary. It was just a salad however and probably didn showcase the chef talents like other more gluttonous options on the menu probably would have. The boss commented that his salad was just ok and pronounced it a bit rustic. After seeing the large stem attached to a frisee (or some other salad leaf) in his salad, I inclined to agree. All others at our table seemed generally pleased. The place was busy, though not packed, but it was still quite loud - probably a few decibels too high for a business lunch. The contemporary decor is sleek, although unappreciated by some in our party. I think it probably a sexier space at night. Our service was pretty disappointing. Very distant and inconsistent: sometimes water glasses were refilled right away, sometimes not. Our server almost seemed bored with us on the infrequent occasions she visited our table. She wasn rude and didn make any mistakes, but service was still not especially attentive. So, as the boss asked, What does Wolfgang Puck name on the door get you? The answer: an acceptable business lunch, but a few areas needing improvement. I want to go back for dinner, since I sure that when the A-Team is on - maybe then no improvement would be needed., Came here a few months ago for a lovely anniversary lunch. While I would not probably go out of my way to come here normally because it feels a little unnatural to me to pay so much for even high-end Asian food, it is great for a special event or for a power lunch on the company. Overall the food was good; I especially liked my duck curry. The creamy and peanutty curry sauce was full of shredded duck, which was not fatty luck most duck curries. I especially liked how the cool coconut cut through the richness of the curry. My boyfriend enjoyed his huge stack of calamari (yelp.com/biz_photos/4FaH206) for an appetizer and salmon entree. The only thing I was underwhelmed with was the pork belly dumplings I had heard so much about. They were fine but not that different from freshly made dumplings I have had at other Asian restaurants for a fraction of the price. I liked the sleekness of this restaurant and their patio. Even though the Source is in the middle of the city, it felt so tranquil outside. Finally, the service was great. Our waitress was very attentive even though we were the only couple outside and everyone else was inside. When we made our reservations, my boyfriend mentioned it was our anniversary so they personalized our dessert, which was cute. (yelp.com/biz_photos/4FaH206), For the month of August from Monday to Thursday, there is an unlisted 9 course meal deal called the Chinese banquet. For 45 dollars a person you get a 9+ course meal. It was very confusing at first since we learned about the special through some blogs and the waiter told us that there were only 3 courses. But as the food rolled out, we counted not 9 but almost 13 courses! Green beans with almonds, fried rice with Chinese sausage, lamb lettuce wraps, salmon filets, chicken salad, shrimp rolls, dumplings, curry chicken, slow cooked ribs with noodles, 3 different sorbets, 3 different ice creams, chocolate molten cake, and a cheese cake. As we stuffed ourselves beyond belief, we were betting each other that there was a typo with the price since the regular 7course menu was $125. The check came and it was indeed 45 a person. This is by far the greatest bang for your buck deal in DC. Service was great but slow., The Source offers its patrons exactly what we have come to expect from Wolfgang Puck. The food is very well thought through and consistently prepared well.To the extent I take issue with The Source, it is with the pricing. It is priced fairly high and I am not of the opinion that it is worth it. While I still return from time-to-time for the sake of variety, I usually opt for one of the many better options DC provides. Indeed, each time I sign the credit card slip, I suffer buyers remorse wishing I had chosen differently., The Tuna Tartare may make your head pop off it is THAT amazing. A VERY solid cocktail menu too!, I very close to this place. So, essentially, it could be gas station that sells Colt 45 and I frequent it. Overall, The Source serves delicious food and tasty drinks, but youe charged handsomely for the privilege. A couple of people with a couple of cocktails and a couple of appetizers easily sets you back $100.In fact, we always hang out at the bar because we think itl be cheaper and more convenient, but when we get the bill, often wonder why we just didn do it proper-style upstairs.Here a mini-rundown of the small plates:General Tso chicken wings: Effindelish. You will secretly lick this sauce up with your fingers when no one looking.Kobe sliders: You get four on small brioche buns with pickles and an onion marmalade - theye good, but can be hit or miss (Ie had them served way over-done and pretty rare).Pork belly dumplings: The vinegar sauce is great, but the dumplings themselves are pretty heavy and not extraordinary.Tuna cones: Tartar in a crisy cone - tastes just like it sounds. Fresh fish with an interesting presentation, but nothing remarkable.Short ribs: Wee only ordered these once and they were pretty dry.Fries: Crispy and delish, but the bearnaise was watery.Pizza: Nice chewy crust - we prefer the margherita to any of the other options.Heirloom tomato salad: The picked shallots are amazing and the dressing and fantastic.Scallop and shrimp sui mai: Interesting and complex flavors. The lobster-enu emulsion is great. Get these instead of the pork belly dumplings.Crispy suckling pig: Tremendous. Cut into little squares, the bottom is crunchy and the middle is soft and tender. A great dish.Unfortunately, none of the desserts wee had have been outstanding. I mean, don get me wrong, put a bowl of sugar in front of me and Il eat it with a smile, but so far, these selections have just been so-so.The blueberry crumble is nice, but takes like something I could make at home. The chocolate truffle cake is like any other lava dessert Ie had, and the carrot cake is pretty standard. The high-point to each is the ice cream that served with it (ginger, espresso, rum raisin).On an atmosphere aside, the music they play in there can either be really amazing or really terrible, depending on the mix. Theye got a great classic rock mix with all of your 70s favorites and a couple of really embarrassing pop and rap mixes that seem out of place in such a gorgeous and refined space., Another Wolfgang Puck delight! We ate there twice in one week, the food is incredible - spicy tuna in sesame cones, arctic char with chutney are divine, as well as other dishes. Save room for dessert - carrot cake, chocolate fondant, chai ice cream and much more. I cant wait to go back. The staff are friendly as are the managers Adam and Rika who are warm and lovely. The chef came and met us, we love this restaurant., The restaurant is very modern with stark colored walls and an emphasis on clean lines. The decor is contemporary and sleek without being cold. Our server was friendly and charismatic, and his charm helped us relax as soon as we were seated. My husband and I ordered a few appetizers to start with and we were not disappointed. My favorite was the crispy suckling pig. The meat was tender and the skin oh so crispy and delicious. We also had the arctic char with pickled cucumbers which was tasty. The only blunder was the spicy tuna tartare which was more sweet than spicy. The tartare was served in bite-size sesame cones, but the sweetness of the miso glaze on the cones overpowered the flavor of the tuna.As for the entrees, we took the recommendations of the server. I ordered the Kobe short ribs which were cooked to perfection. The meat fell off the bone and the robust flavor was almost overwhelming...maybe it was the saffron? My husband ordered the duck with lo mein noodles. His dish was flavorful but a tad bit too sweet for my taste. I liked the duck and the chewiness of the lo mein noodles but it tasted like the sauce was a little too heavy on the hoisin sauce. Overall, it was a great meal. Ill be back!, The first time we went to he Source there were quite a few things that did not go well. After discussing the matter with the management, we were invited as guests back to The Source for a second visit (a pleasant surprise). The following review is from our second visit to The Source.We were pleasantly greeted by the manager. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. The food was excellent. However, one of the complaints we had from our first visit lingered during this visit as well - lack of a sommelier.In a high end restaurant, we expected there to be a sommelier who could tell us a little bit more about the wine besides just the type like chardonay, port etc. The wine did not come with the courses. It was either too early or too late which takes away from the whole wine pairing concept.Also Wolfgang Puck has very little to do with the restaurant and appears to just sell his name to it. Will I be going back? Sure, but mostly for the food. The Kobe Beef entree was perfect but came with a high price ($50+)., The Source is pretty expensive, but also pretty good. Service was excellent and I loved the decor. The noise level was very good- not too loud, you can actually converse with your dining companion- loved that! Food-- I had heard that the appetizers tended to be better than the entrees (also that eating in the lounge was better than the dining room), and I would agree with that. We had the pork belly dumplings, which were awesome! Also the crab cake appetizer, which was delicious. I also liked the freebie sesame green beans and candied walnuts they give you when youre seated-yum! For entrees, hubby had the lamb, which he said was very good, and I had the special, which was a Hong Kong-style lobster. The lobster was good, but the way the waiter had described it, I thought it would be more spicy and flavorful. I actually didnt think the lobster was overpriced- $52, but thats for a whole lobster, shelled-not bad IMHO. For dessert, we split the carrot cake, which was out of this world, but at $12, was a stingy little piece of cake for that price (which didnt bother me at the time because I was so full!). So, the appetizers and dessert were amazing, and the entrees very good. All in all, the Source lives up to Wolfgang Pucks reputation. Next time Ill try eating in the Lounge (bar), though., This was all that everyone had told me it would be and more. We were a party of eight and did the tasting menu with wine pairing that was phenomenal. Let me start off saying that the entire experience was five star from the first phone call. The manager Adam, handled multiple changes in this reservation meticulously from start to the completion of our meal the level of service he provided was phenomenal. Our Sommelier, Christiana was incredible! She was so knowledgeable about wines, grapes and vintors we actually not only enjoyed her perceptive pairings but learned a few things over the course of our elaborate dinner. The entire team was engaged in our having an over the top experience! The food and preparations were phenomenal and our server Olga was on top of her game. I am not going to get into all the food we had, just go and learn what fine dining can be in the hippest setting in DC., I came with two friends, and we tried the 9-course banquet menu (9 courses, selected by the house, served family style, for $45). I like to give this review 2.5 stars, because I wasn impressed by anything I ate. (And I not one of those people that takes pride in being unimpressed by things--hey, I rather be able to say I had a great meal.)The courses came out in 3s. None of the trios seemed to work well together. The flavors sometimes actively competed with each, but for the most part they just didn do anything to enhance each other. Several dishes were over-cooked.I chose to give this 3 stars instead of 2, because I know you always take a risk when you go with the special menu kind of thing. Maybe if we stuck to the regular menu, I woulde been happier. As is, I have no desire to go back., Great service, wonderful food. Try the pork belly dumplings and order dessert, both were highlights., The lunch menu is accessible, fairly interesting, and not overly pricey. Fantastic service. We were the first table for lunch, and for some reason we didnt get the amuse bouche, which was disappointing., Wow. Rock on! After passing this place by for over a year, we tried it and found it supremely satisfying. The tuna tartare was particularly awesome. You pay for what you get, but the two dishes we had were pretty darn good., I had considerable reservations about visiting The Source, just blocks from the Capitol building in downtown Washington, DC, however, with so many positive reviews, we decided to give it a try, as we were craving Asian fusion fare. My concerns were centered on the name Wolfgang Puck. Many mass celeb chef establishments tend to be somewhat sub par, in my opinion, as the patrons tend to be tourists who are hooked on Food Network programs and other cooking shows who rave about the food on review sites. Examples such as Emeril Lagasse Tchoup Chop in Orlando, Emerils Miami Beach and Emeril New Orleans Fish House in Las Vegas are some such examples of tourist dining heavens that are quite frankly, not worth the visit. My exposure to eating at any Wolfgang Puck restaurant is limited, but with airport pizza shops, branded cooking merchandise and frozen dinners, I was very leery about this trip. Given its location in DC, a very tourist heavy destination, I could not help but have somewhat low expectations as did one of my dining partners. We arrived to find that the restaurant entrance is actually on 16th and not on Pennsylvania Ave, although the address is noted as such on OpenTable.com. The warmly lit first floor was sleek, with floor to ceiling windows. We were seated upstairs. Service was mixed - not terribly professional by both the waiter and the gent who deboned our whole fish sea bass, who rolled his eyes when he asked if we wanted to debone it or have him do it. At $40.00 for a fried fish, we opted to have him do the work, which prompted the circular eye movements. The tiny dumplings that were so highly rated were quite frankly somewhat disappointing. Expecting a tender skinned dumpling, the exterior wrapping was tough as were the chicken dumplings, which we also ordered. The sauces were quite good and consisted of black vinegar, chili oil, ginger and cilantro leaves. Had it not been for these garnishments, these dumplings would have easily been sold at Trader Joe at the frozen food counter ... come to think of it, they probably are, given that this IS a Wolfgang Puck resto. The creamy onion soup was well prepared with chunks of apple or pear which added a nice texture. Large chunks of spicy tuna tartare in sesame miso cones were a fair value. At $17.00 for three cones, they appear somewhat overpriced, however, generous portions of diced tuna are tightly packed in each cone. This is not a unique dish to The Source, as Ie dined on it before at another establishment.Other dishes ordered included the Lacquered Duck, which was described as one bite yum, another bite not so yum, but we attributed this to the high fat content of duck. Scallops were just so-so, with the coconut peanut sauce being the highlight of the dish. We opted to to skip dessert, given the mediocre quality of our dinner. I should have gone with my instincts - avoid mass chain celeb chef restos., Unless you are coming here on some major discount or on a work funded trip, skip it. DC has some great restaurants that dont float on the fame of an absentee celebrity executive chef. I will say that the space is stunning. Gorgeous architecture, very sleek... but I am not licking the walls for dinner, so at the end of the day its a crazy, overpriced place with tiny portions and a huge name to carry it all. If this werent a Wolfgang Puck joint it would be out of business stat. Thank god for tourists., Let me get this off of my chest: great food is great food. Period. If that great food doesn fit your budget, I completely understand. There are certainly restaurants that I haven tried yet because it is beyond what I would spend on a typical night out. So many comments Ie heard about The Source are along the lines of it was really good, but not worth the money. It is a splurge to be sure, but every part of our experience was exquisite. Also, whether the name on the restaurant is Wolfgang Puck or Ronald McDonald, great food is great food. I don care if Wolfgang serves me the meal or if he visits every February 29th on leap years. What difference does it make? It like, if I playing an Arnold Palmer designed golf course, to I really expect Arnie there mowing the greens daily? The answer is I DON CARE. With that said....I would go back for the creamy seven onion soup alone. It was in incredible way to start the meal that raised my expectations, which were met by each new course. My entree was a special that evening (and was amazing) so Il skip to the dessert. Their trio of homemade ice cream was a fun game of which one do I like the best. There is no right answer. Is in socially unacceptable to go to a restaurant to order soup and ice cream only? I hope not, I might have to do it. I can only imagine that everything on the menu is equally impressive. My ONLY commentary about the restaurant that I found, well, weird was the music that was playing. I kid you not that while in the dining room the playlist went from Huey Lewis to Tone Loc back to back. It didn seem to fit. I not going to let it go that I find it funny that somebody would post a review along the lines of I went here for a work event, it was great, but it too expensive so I not rating it well. YOU DIDN EVEN PAY FOR IT! Let put it this way. If your place of business is doing a work event at The Source, invite yourself. Make sure youe a part of that field trip. If your family is in from out of town and suggests treating you to dinner here, go. And if your budget allows you to treat yourself once or twice a month for dinner on the weekend, that fantastic. In any case I think youl agree that the food and experience is fantastic., Crab cakes were the best Ive ever had and Ive had lots of crab cakes. Tuna cones are amazing. Suckling pig is a perfect appetizer. You wont believe how good the short ribs are. Crispy duck had unbelievable taste. The presentation was perfect. The service was perfect. The ambience was perfect. Next time im back in D.C. I will definitely come back here., This is a Wolfgang Puck DC restaurant venture - its kinda cool that celebrity chefs are establishing good restaurants here in DC no matter what people say about the name and all. Its located at the News Museum and to me that look like a posh apartment building as well. Its very inconspicuous I wouldnt have even notice it if I was driving past. The first floor is the bar area, dimly lit, very stark and a bit clinical. The bartender was very pleasant - the pear martini was great and the Sancerre Sauvignon Blanc was fruitily gentle. The restaurant was on the second floor - it looked very posh and spacious. The crowd was different from what I usually see in DC, its touristy or family with children or older suited well dressed couples. Apparently Mr Puck has a eclectic taste for music - I was sipping sauvignon blanc with 80s electronic music like Bizarre love triangle. I heard later in the night they play Pink Floyd. The style of cuisine is asian fusion - a szechuan spicy green beans with walnut was served - it was very flavorful. My friend commented how salty the food is in general. I tried to bear that in mind while tasting the dishes. Somehow I ended up with a crispy-skin-trio experience. The waiter recommended the artic char which we tried - it was cooked perfectly crispy on the outside and medium inside. It was tandoori rubbed it tasted mildly of indian flavors with some strong tasting indian-infused vegetables as well as a yogurt. All I can say is its odd but it tasted good. I had to ask for the suckling pig just to see what its all about. The skin was nicely roasted, again very crispy it was served with a pearl or cipollini onion and the meat was marinated and served under the skin in a cube shape. It was good in first few bites but the skin would get stuck on my teeth as I chew it - I dont like that feeling. For entree I had the roasted duckling - the third crispy skin. Like Arcadiana it was half a duck. Its got to be the best deal ever to order duck in DC! The duck was cooked perfectly and the skin was so crispy and it came right off the duck. The duck was thoroughly cooked chinese-style. It was served with a side of lo mein or yellow noodle as I know it. It was extremely salty I did not eat it. Less carb for me! The lobster that my friend ordered was also cooked to a nice tender but comment of the saltiness from the sauce again surfaced. The last thing that enticed me was the 20-min wait souffle. I was planning on going to watch a film but it was already 830 PM and I decided to have the souffle instead. The souffle came out faster than 20 min it was topped with fresh made ice-cream and creme fraiche. The top has a nice crunch and the inside was chocolatey and moist. It was most worth it.....even though I was very full, the souffle was absolutely worth the calories. Yum!! Overall, the restaurant is more on the high end. The service was very good that night - I like the european trained hospitality that I am accustomed to so that was great!, Excellent food, service and atmosphere. Great for special occasions., I dont want to reinvent the wheel here, but here are the salient points from other reviews Id like to concur with:1. Whoever developed the menu (Wolfgang) has no input into its preparation, cooking, plating, etc. We were a party of ten and sampled five other plates...nothing inspired or interesting.2. Downstairs music: Lounge/Techno. Upstairs music: Neil Young. Totally and completely bizarre.3. Heres your Rorschach test for this restaurant. If when cooking at home, you opt for steak on the grill and frequently cant get over how good it is, this is the restaurant for you. If you, instead, opt for recipes that are challenging to execute well and were inspired by your favorite cooking show, this is not the restaurant for you.4. Also, for this price, the service was B.A.D. We were a party of 10 and our total bill came to $2200. We should have had two waitstaff. Inexcusable., Subdued decor reminded me of Cityzen. Our appetizers were crispy pork belly and dumplings. Both were good, although unremarkable. The pork belly offered more contrast in textures than taste. The lacquered duck with lo mein noodles was one of the best duck dishes Ive had tender, meaty, and tasteful. The seared scallops with drunken noodles were excellent, although given the ordinary size of the scallops a fourth would have been appreciated. Wine was reasonably priced given the price level of the menu. Both rest rooms only accommodate one person - a major design flaw for an establishment of this size. All in all, I dont get the buzz. Spending this much I think youll find better choices elsewhere., The service at the bar is pretty good. Maybe because I know chinese/thai/sushi places where you can probably get the same food and for a lot less, i thought the food at the source is only ok. The best dish was the duck. The dumpling was WAY too small.They have separate bar and restaurant menu. We were told that certain things are only offered at the bar, however when we went to get our dinner, our server told us that she can get us food from the bar menu if we want. They actually have a elevator in the restaurant which I find it unusual in DC, but its a nice feature.Its your typical trendy Asian fusion restaurant. Nothing too spectacular. I will probably go back again for drinks and not dinner., The Source is a winner on all fronts. I finally got a chance to visit Wolfgang Puck first DC Restaurant venture and enjoyed every second of it. I have a DC Restaurant Bucket List and The Source was on it. When I first perused their menu online, I decided (a). I had to come and (b). I either had to find someone else to fund it or eat in the lounge. I opted for the lounge - you can order from both menus, which means you can assemble your own meal and combine the expensive stuff with the cheaper stuff. House-keeping item: I am friends with one of the bartenders (we used to work at Lia together), so we were well taken care of by the staff and had some incredible recommendations made for us. That being said, all things we ate were from the menu and the quality was simply top-notch. I told Zach (the bartender) to just go ahead and make something for me. It ended up being their Asian Pear Martini. It tasted just like pear and was wonderfully sweet. Though my dining partner in crime, Kevin L did not really appreciate it, he thoroughly enjoyed his Negroni cocktail which was the perfect mixture of Hendrick Gin and Campari. For seconds, I stuck with the pear martini whereas Kevin tried out The Hemingway. The Hemingway was tasty, but I loved the pear. (Each cocktail - $12)And the food... wow. While we pondered over the menu(s), we first snacked on the tempura-fried green beans. They were accompanied with a green sauce and were very flavorful. Great for sharing. We decided on the tiny dumplings (pork belly dumplings), the spicy tuna roll and the Guilin squid with crispy noodles and pork belly. In addition to these items, we were also presented with the shrimp and scallop shumai over a lobster sauce, the veggie roll and the pork belly buns on steamed bao. With the exception of the pork belly dumplings, all of these items were from their newly launched Lounge menu. There were a plethora of other exciting things to order but these were highly recommended by the bartenders. Kevin and I are chatter-bugs but the moment we ate those dumplings, there was silence...for about 5 minutes. Then there was a sigh of bliss. And then more silence. Yes, that how much I love the pork belly dumplings...aside from the fact that I had been gushing about them all day prior to coming here. They come in an order of 8 for $16 and are served with cilantro sprigs and black vinegar. Worth every penny. I also really enjoyed the Guilin squid. The squid and pork belly were served atop crispy fried noodles sort of shaped like a hockey puck. It is already cut into fourths as you go to dive in. We absolutely refused to use forks but let me tell ya - this dish is a true challenge to test your chopstick skills. The shrimp and scallop shumai were delightful. Doused in the lobster sauce, when eaten, this reminded me a bit like seafood bisque. Following this, our spicy tuna roll appeared with the veggie roll. The Source makes their own soy sauce and serves real wasabi. I don like wasabi and as it turns out, I don like real wasabi either. I did, however, like both of these rolls. The tuna and the veggies were incredibly fresh and you could taste it with every bite in each roll, respectively. We were pretty stuffed at this point but were coerced into eating more. And I sooo glad we did. Because then we would have missed out on the pork belly buns yelp.com/biz_photos/4FaH206 ($8). Which according to Kevin were good but not on par with those youl find at Momofuku in NYC but come on! Where else in DC will you find them!?There was no room for dessert. Absolutely none. But I rather have spent my time eating all of these modestly portioned plates than any dessert. Pork belly trumps chocolate. There, I said it!The bartender service was flawless. Our water was constantly re-filled, plates were cleared timely, menu recommendations were perfect and they often checked to make sure we were enjoying everything without being intrusive. That really all I can ask for. They were also very pleasant to chat up. The Lounge was not very full on this particular Wednesday evening but I could totally picture this as a hotspot for the downtown crowd during happy hour. I noticed on their lounge menu that between 4pm-6pm, you can order 3 items for ~$20. That kind of a steal here. As for the rest of the space - lots of glass, light and airy during the day; dark and cozy at night. Plenty of couches/booths to snuggle up to but also plenty of tables and bar space. With a heavy wallet or cash to burn, I come back for dinner in a heartbeat. But I happy to sample Chef Scott treats in the lounge til then. I recommend this place for anyone with an expense account and really wanting to impress a client to a fantastic dinner., First off, this ended up being the most expensive meal Ive ever paid for... so theres your disclaimer at the front. Was it the most delicious or special meal Ive ever had? No... was it the most satisfying and borderline exciting for me by the end? Yes, in fact it really was.Lets get some of the stuff out of the way... the service is as perfect as youll find in DC, for what thats worth. The wine list and cocktail lists are awesome. Try the Blue Sage... blueberry vodka, sweet and sour, and sage leaves. Its just amazing, didnt see it coming.Now, I didnt know what to pick, and I really wanted an experience so the lady friend and I got the 7 course tasting menus (I opted for the wine pairings, which I was highly impressed and satisfied by). They ask you two simple questions, anything you dont eat? and any allergies? No on both accounts for me, the lady friend is a vegetarian. No worries. They then go to work, and surprise you with each course, just amazing. Now, brace yourself... for meat-laden 7 courses it was 125 plus 75 for the wine pairings. The vegetarian was 25 dollars less? I cant remember now, but it was a nice surprise. Its worth it, Ive never shoveled more food into my mouth that I was as impressed by... there isnt a best course, its the inclusiveness of everything put together.They started me off with a glass of pick prosecco that was excellent, and an amuse bouche for us both. The courses came at a great pace with the wines hitting the table a minute or two prior, just absolutely perfect. All of the wines were excellent and fit each course perfectly. While they say its a 7 course meal... I counted 9. They just kept bringing glasses of wine (from Prosecco, to Sancerre, Chard, Pinot Noir, Cab Sav, etc etc... and a port with dessert). The dumplings were phenomenal, particularly the pork belly ones (they also add chicken ones to the serving). The kobe beef short ribs were transcendent and the duck was the best prepared foul Ive ever tasted. Perfectly crispy and juicy at the same time. Seriously just give it a shot whether youre carnivourous like me, or a vegetarian... the gf was wholly impressed and loved every course, never feeling like she was being undersold due to eating no meat.Desserts... phenomenal. Two servings of dessert with the first being a coconut sorbet that was the best coconut based product Ive ever had. Oh, and the music... this has been brought up a few times, and its fing crazy... just completely non-sensical, which is actually kind of fun to enjoy... its like the worlds largest and most random ipod put on the most random of random settings., Tiny pork belly dumplings = happy bellySpicy tuna tartare cones = tasty & creative Marinated shortrib appetizer = bites o heavenFirst ever Kobe beef steak = deliriousPear martini = dangerously fabulousReasonably priced lounge menu = Ill be back, The Source is one of the most expensive restaurants Ive been to in DC, but the food is sooooo good that its well worth it. This is the type of place you go for a special occasion because it will be a meal to remember. I had a three course lunch that included the pork dumplings, the kobe burger, and chocolate dessert. The service and food were so incredible that I cant wait to go back!
76|unum-washington|I will only comment on food and atmosphere because I was there for the soft opening and dont think its fair to comment on anything else.First off, I love the look of the place - its classy, tasteful, and a little bit upscale without being a little bit uptight. Maybe the word is trendy? But its more comfortable than that. Just nice clean lines and not too much flash. Sort of a modern, asain, zen design thats cool without being pretentious. Okay! The food - so delicious! If you can only get two things get: The Quail and the Caesar Salad. Im not kidding. Please message me if you dont agree and I will write you an apology letter for leading you astray. They are great. The Caesar salad is simple but unique - its one of those dishes that makes you wonder why you dont always order Caesar salad (answer: because its rarely this good) and it comes with the amazing artichoke custard with crusted parmesan to go onto toasted bread. The Quail - I just dont know how to explain. Its fantastic. The tastes are wonderful and well developed and the pistachios and spinach beneath are just as good (dont you hate it when that part is bad?) Its simple and small (see photos, though one piece was already eaten by my party...sneaky devil... so theres normally four piece) because its a small plate item. Next best: truffle mac & cheese. I dont feel like i need to explain that. The short rib pasta was really good, but I personally dont love sweet pastas, so - for me - Id pass, but the others LOVED it. I had the mac & cheese, they had the short rib pasta. Very fair trade for all involved. Finally, there was also beet salad and the spicy eggplant - both great, but the spicy eggplant just didnt fit with the rest of the things we were eating for me, so I didnt really dive in too much. The beet salad, however, was divine. Great cocktail menu and wine list. Give it go if youre in the area or make the trip to get there, I think youll be pleasantly surprised!, Finally good food in georgetown. I had a wonderful meal on opening night. I will be a frequent visitor here., Fantastic food, elegant-casual environment makes this smart contemporary new hot-spot a MUST. Chef Blane who I understand has some major street-cred gave us bowl licking greatness with a dash of pure neurotic artistry. Wait, did someone mention that they opened only a few nights ago??? Lamb shank was deep and divine, bouillabaisse was bright and fresh, beet salad was smart & zesty and the chicken liver mousse...um...like velvet. A zen-like yet unpretentious atmosphere with knowledgeable servers with smiling faces will keep me and my guests going back to UNUM for many years. This is the real deal. Bravo folks!, Love this place! Went on valentine day. Received great service from staff. Had the humboldt fog and unum chicken liver mousse to start off with some malbec wine. The chicken liver mousse was so good. Melts in your mouth. For the small plates, bf and I had the caesar salad and oyster three ways. Caesar salad came with an artichoke parmesan custard. I highly recommend it.For larger plates, I had the rockfish bouillabaisse and bf had the boneless shortrib pasta (it listed under the smaller plates section but you can get it in a bigger portion). Both dishes were delish. Our waiter paired my seafood dish with a really great white wine called tomero torrontes mendoza. Definitely order the truffle mac and cheese on the side. Yummy!, I have been waiting FOREVER for something to fill the location formerly known as Mendocino - it was worth the wait. We went the week it opened (which can be tricky, but they pulled it off without a hitch). Friendly hostess + waitstaff; great food. We will be back!!, This is a GREAT restaurant appropriate for many occasions. The atmosphere is intimate but has energy, and the design is beautiful. I havent even started on the food or drinks, which are also excellent! You have to try this neighborhood/ DC gem!, Very nice place for an intimate date or a relaxing evening...loved the atmosphere and customer service!, Quail and beet salad to start. Quail was decent, the beet salad was very small and weirdly salty. Moved on to Lamb shank and the gnocchi. The lamb shank was good and hearty but didnt blow us away whilst the gnocchi was tasty but not really enough food for an entree. Desserts - beignets and chocolate ganache both very good. Location and atmosphere promising. Overall decent experience but the beet salad / gnocchi combo was not really enough food for the money., I loved Mendocino and was sad to see it closed but am very happy that its place has been filled by another great restaurant. We went on Friday to check it out for the first time and really loved it. The atmosphere is quaint and cozy and the menu isnt huge but has plenty of options for everyone. We had some charcuterie to start and the humboldt fog cheese was amazing. We also had oysters 3 ways that were fine, not amazing but not terrible. For entrees I had the bouilabaise which was really delicious. Others dining had the steak and were fans as well. We got the spicy eggplant side which was AMAZING and we wish we had gotten another one instead of the jalapeno grits which were fine but nothing special. The wine list is great and the staff was really nice and friendly. All in all it was a great first trip and I was surprised at the lack of issues considering they havent been open for very long!, My boyfriend and I relentlessly (ok, just me) looked for the perfect restaurant to finish off our trip in Washington DC. We walked to 1789, Fahrenheit and Citronelle but none of them quite fulfilled all I was looking for in a restaurant. The journey continued until I spotted Unum across the street. It hadnt shown up on my Yelp search so we decided check out their menu.After interrogating the guests who had just left the restaurant, their outstanding reviews convinced me to give it a try. We ordered the gnocchi, the burger and the chicken with 2 glasses of the Tempranillo. I know that sounds like a very ordinary dinner, but it was just the opposite. Everything was delectably prepared with just the right amount of accompaniments balancing perfectly with the wine. I left feeling satisfied, but not sick. So next time youre wandering about Georgetown, whether youre starving or just looking for something small with wine, treat yourself by stopping into Unum. You wont regret it., Rest of DC, please take note, THIS is how you do it!Great location? Check.Intimate, trendy, but not pretentious atmosphere? Check.Personable service? Check.Creative and delicious menu? Check, check, and check!Its hard to believe that Unum is only in its second month of operation. It has already become one of the citys best restaurants, in my opinion. This past Friday, I had the pleasure of having dinner here. Walking in, we were greeted by one of the owners of Unum. We were smart to have a reservation, because the place was packed. But unlike other restaurants on a Friday night, the staff here looked happy, welcoming, and ready to serve. Our waiter, James, couldnt have been more excited about our visit. He suggested several things from the menu, promising us that like most of Unums guests, after one taste we were sure to become regulars. He also took charge with suggesting our drinks, one glass of rose and another of red, both delicious.So dont let the name small plates fool you, Unum does not skimp on their dishes! The boneless shortrib pasta, just trust me, get it. The lemon goat cheese on the beet salad was perfection. And the braised indian spiced lamb shank was so large that we werent able to finish it. But not for lack of trying! The bill came to about 80-90 dollars, which in included 4 drinks, 2 small plates and 1 large plate. I was willing to pay twice that the dining experience I had here. I cant wait to have a reason to come here again. Georgetown is usually not worth the trek for me, but Unum is a game changer., Ill go with the crowd here - one of the better dining options in DC. This review is mainly intended as a shout out to an outstanding St. Supery Virtu White Meritage on their wine list., Great atmosphere, delicious food and outstanding service - this place has all it needs. Went there with my whole family at the end of a short trip to DC. Most of us had a small plate of the boneless shortrib pasta as appetizer and braised indian lamb shank as entree. Both dishes are highly recommendable, but particularly the lamb shank wich was one of the best Ive ever had. We finished off with ricotta beignets and chocolate soft-ganache. In general, I am not a big fan of desserts, but these desserts were just awsome. I would recommend the ricotta beignets for people who do not prefer very sweet and sugary desserts., First review ever on Yelp but I had to - had a great dinner at this restaurant. The place was full but they were so accommodating and the service was great! Sweet potato soup had a great flavor to it and our whole group loved the ricotta beignets. Will definitely return on my next trip to DC!, We went on a recent weekend night and were able to sit at the bar without a reservation. We had an amazing beet salad, which was beautifully presented and included picked, raw, and roasted beets. They also give you a bread basket with a delicious (cilantro?) dip. I loved my entree, the rosemary gnocchi. The truffle butter put it over the top. I thought my partners entree, the hanger steak, was good but not as special. (He liked it, though!), My parents were in town last week and I wanted to take them out to a nice restaurant in georgetown that woudlnt break the bank(ie. Bourbon, Citronelle, etc) but had good quality food. I was super excited to find this newly opened place that had gotten positive reviews.The outside is nondescript and the place is cozy. The food was around a 4 probably. The bread and sauce/butter were as good as any other free bread, but its just free bread. For apps my dad got the oyster 3 way and me and the gf split the sweet potato soup. My dad scarfed down the oysters, but thats not to be surprised. The sweet potato soup was good, but nothing special.For entrees we got:Artic Char - well cooked, but the sunchoke puree was barely visible and looked dried/caked onto my plate. I wondering if there was a mis-plate mistake(see lamb shank) Gnocchi - delicious gnocchi. I prefer pieces a tad smaller, and a sauce a tad less rich. but overall it was very good.Lamb Shank - super tender, my mom loved it.. One minor note, there was a crisp that didn come out with the dish. ~5 mins after we got the dish, a waiter brought it out on separate plate. Braised Short Rib Pasta - i didnt try it but my dad seemed to enjoy it.We also got sides fo the salted cod fritters and brussel sprouts. Brussel sprouts were delicious(but nothing spectacular) and the cod fritters were a touch too salty for my palette. They were well fried though.For dessert we shared the ricotta beignets, chocolate ganache, and my dad ate his own plate of ice cream/sorbet. all the desserts are on the small side. the beignets were by far the best. the ganache was well plated, but i didn see anything special in it. and the $7 ice cream/sorbet plate was super tiny, 2 bites max per flavor.Definitely some postiives, but also some negatives in the food. I did notice a few other things which is why i knocking this to a 3/3.5 star review.Our table was placed under a vent that was blowing warm air. I didn mind it temperature wise, but it was distracting. The bottle of white wine we ordered was served room temp. I shoulde asked for it to be chilled, but thats my mistake. These things, along with the lamb shank misplate, and the small desserts just dampened my review on the place.With that being said, the price point/quality of food is still better than a lot of what youl find in georgetown so i do recommend it.*UPDATE* 3/6 - The manager called me and discussed some of my issues in the above review. Ie since retracted a comment about about a worker eating in the dining area(it was a solo diner), and theye informed me theye working to correct the vent issue. Always nice to know they read and take the time to follow up!, Although Im not a fan of the name... the food was delicious. I was a little skeptical when I walked, but I was pleasantly surprised.Food: They were very thoughtful in the herbs and flavors they used. I had the monkfish stew and the hint of red curry and Thai influence was nicely done. It enhanced the flavors. My husband had the duck breast and it too had a really nice flavor that enhanced the duck. Not fatty as duck can be sometimes. Really beautifully done. Cockails/Wine: I love Freemark Abbey Cab and voila, it was on the menu! Space/Atmosphere: Very intimate. They manage to fit quite a few tables into a small space. The only downside was I kept getting distracted by our neighboring tables conversation. The acoustics could use some improvement.Try it!, I recently dined at Unum during a business trip to DC. There were 5 of us and we all enjoyed our dishes -- a few highlights were the short rib pasta, the quail, and the mac and cheese. The service was good and the pace of the dishes was nice too -- we didnt feel rushed, nor were we left hungry between courses. The desserts were yummy, especially the winter citrus custard which I wouldnt have picked on my own, but it turned out to be my favorite dessert. The bar menu is also worth mentioning as they had a nice selection of signature cocktails. A few other non-food things I liked about the restaurant were the cozy decor (lots of beautiful wood paneling along the walls and light fixtures), the little library by the bar, and the music they played (great mix of tunes!). My friends from DC had been to the restaurant that used to be in this space and they all agreed that the Unum was a beautiful and tasty addition to the neighborhood. I think they will be back and hopefully, I will too on my next trip!, Great food and amazing drinks. I was at the bar with friends. Bartender Dmitry makes some sick drinks! Great service! Will come back again., We had a fantastic Friday night dinner at Unum. We started by experimenting with their cheese and charcuterie, which was awesome. Our waiter recommended a glass of wine for the items we picked, and Ive never had such a good experience eating cheese. We then had two appetizers of beet salad and oysters, and both were great. The beet salad was very light and refreshing, and oysters were prepared several different ways. My wife scooped out every last egg of caviar from the pouched oyster sauce. For entrees, we had a great duck and fish dishes, again with another glass of wine recommended by the waiter. I have not had much duck in my life, and the meat is generally a bit gamey for my tastes, but the way it was prepared along with the bitter greens and wine was just a pure sense of contentment. We finished by sharing a dessert, which might have been the best thing we had that evening, which is really after impressive after so many rich flavors and experiences.It was a great modern restaurant and we hope to come back again soon!, Ugh, DC. Why do you do this to me? I would like to nominate DC for the capital of overpriced mediocre dining.I am assuming the glowing reviews here are from some mixture of friends of the owner and over-eager, over-paid Washingtonians who do not know how to eat (which given my experience with restaurants here, is most of the populace).On to my review. The biggest caveat is that we did not order a main meal. We came late after a kind of odd day so we ended up ordering a charcuterie plate, drinks, and desert. This is admittedly not the fairest test of the food, however it was enough to tell me never to come here again.The charcuterie was admittedly not bad, the cheese being better than the various cured meats. The price, however, was high given the tiny quantities. I know this is how things go in this town, but it still shocking that you can pay $20 for what amounts to 4 ounces of meat and cheese. The thing that really set me off, is the TINY TINY amounts of condiments. They literally cut a single cornichon in HALF... are you seriously that cheap? It did add some hilarity to the evening when the poor waiter (clearly just following orders) laboriously pointed out all of the lovely amentities on our plate, including the cut-in-half cornichon and a half teaspoon of mustard. The whole plate just looked very cheap.The drinks (beer) were fine as was the desert (probably the most respectable thing, though $7 for 3 oz of sorbet is again, very overpriced).The decor, which others have effusively praised as warm and inviting, is actually quite clinical and cold to my eyes. It may look cool but it gives off a soul-less vibe all to familiar in this town of restaurants as cash-making enterprises. I sure it looked good on the designer computer rendering, but it felt very impersonal, and did not give off any feeling that the place was dedicated to good food.The restaurant is small, the tables are crowded together, and the result is a space that is very loud. I had to keep saying what did you say? to my dining partner.Service: Crossing the border into over-attentive and slightly condescending. Good waiters know when to approach the table, and know to keep a distance while still serving well. Here the heavy hand of the management coaching behavior and responses was pretty evident, and doesn leave a very favorable impression.I really wanted to like this place given the reviews. I thought maybe a miracle had occured in Georgetown. Sadly, we won be back., One of the best RW experiences Ive been to. My friend works here and messaged me that they were running RW at Unum. I hadnt even heard about Unum (gasp) so was defintiely looking forward dto trying. My friend and I booked a reservation the next night and wow!! I loved it the second I walked in. Modern and a casual chic atmosphere. the saddest part of my night? THEY RAN OUT OF QUAIL! in their defense, our reservation was at 10 lol...so i definitely will have to be back to try it! This is going to sound like im crazy, but I really do believe if a restaurant gives good bread out in the beginning, its a much higher chance that the apps and entrees are going to be great. Their bread is FABULOUS!!!! Straight from the oven baguettes, perfectly crunchy with the yummiest sides!Everything we tried was solid but there were definitely a few outstanding dishes. The beet salad for one was plated beautifully and tasted delicious. Everything complemented each other well on the plate. the cheese and charcuterie plate was delicious and also plated very intricately. The crab cakes had basically no filler and the light arugula salad that came with it was delicious. One of my favs! The branzino was underwelming, but still tasty. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and a solid dish. THE BEEF short rib pasta...oh my goodness! so delicious and flavorful, a little bit heavy for summertime restaurant week, but PERFECT for wintertime. I hope they keep it on the menu!Desserts were solid, nothing amazing, but definitely delicious. The beignets were good and the chocolate bar was delicious. Oh and of course who can forget the drinks?!! Even the RW red wine was fabulous and my friends hendriks drink was strong and delicious.I cant wait to go back to try the quail!!, We were staying in Georgetown and frankly, had been disappointed with several of the restaurants we tried. When we shared our frustration with our hotel concierge at the Ritz in Georgetown, he recommended Unum. We had walked past it, and I thought its name was Num Num Num from looking at the etched glass signage on the door! It could have been named that, in my mind!Upon arrival, we were greeted by Laura, the co-owner. She wished us a happy anniversary and we had complimentary glasses of champagne immediately upon being seated. Nice start! The meal -- wow, the meal! Started with delicious bread with sweet and savory spreads. The cracker bread with the chimichurri sauce was so good I was afraid I wouldn have room for my meal! We ordered a wide variety of entrees, from my deliciously delicate gnocchi with peas to our companion very thick hamburger. She declared it was one of the best burgers she had eaten, but it was definitely a knife and fork burger! I am embarrassed to admit that I have no idea what our other diners were eating, because it disappeared so fast! I think one had the short ribs and the other had the fish special? But it was hard to tell because there was nothing left on their plates.Desserts were fabulous. One was a mint ice cream sandwich and another was a beignet with blueberry sauce. The mint ice cream tasted like it was made with fresh mint and I kept thinking there was a touch of lemon verbena in it as well. It was served on its side on a bed of dirt which was like a crumbled praline. The beignet was so good I even ate the blueberry sauce, and I do not like blueberries!We found the service to be spot on. The chef-owner came out to speak with us and seemed thrilled to discuss his food with us. We told him we been spoiled by Uchi and Uchiko in Austin and had been looking for something on a par with those two outstanding restaurants, and we found an American version of their deliciousness.We dined early and did not have any noise problems. It is a small space with a little cave for intimate dining, but we ate in the main portion of the dining room. As the night grew later, the noise level did rise, so if it is a problem, I would recommend an earlier reservation. All in all, we were very impressed and wish the owners much success., We were excited to try this replacement for Mendocino in Georgetown. Ambience and service are 4 out of 5, but the food, although thoughtfully presented, lacked flavor. The lamb shank was dry and needed some sort of sauce. The gnocchi wear beautifully plated but, alas, not very flavorful. Our friends agreed, so perhaps the chef took Labor Day weekend off, but I expect more on a Saturday night. Prices very reasonable., The overall experience here was enjoyable. Note that the restaurant is sort of inconspicuous -- located at the corner of M and 30th, right next to the Suntrust bank. The hangar steak small portion was perfectly sized for me...10-12 bites later, I was not meat-nauseous, and I still had my mushroom truffle macaroni & cheese to munch on. Everyones food (with the exception of the duck which tasted like old-rock) was well-made, and their lamb shank was pretty huge. If you are a true eater, then youll know to suck that bone marrow right out to top off your lamb meal. This could be a good place for a romantic date, or a with a group of friends who feel like splurging a little bit.Happy birthday to a fellow Yelper for this!, Absolutely the worst food and experience! Dont believe the reviews. DONT BELIEVE THE REVIEWS!!!!!, Unum! Its that sound you make when you taste something so delicious that the only words you can form are those sounds, unum! With a combination of great wine the food was fun and eccentric with varieties in flavors. Great for foodies, and even caters to my meat eating family shank steak and burger were a huge hit with the not so adventurous eaters!, The calamari was excellent, and so was the bread. Had Bronzino for the main course, well seasoned, fresh and tasty. New waitress should have chosen not go down small talk path due to taking air time from my old friend that I hadnt seen in awhile. Other than that it was very enjoyable. Thing to keep in mind - get there 6 or before because the place fills up with the wonks at 7pm., Went there on a Saturday night. We had made reservations beforehand and were running late but they still sat us promptly. The setting is very small and romantic. The bar was uncomfortably crowded with some people eating at the bar even though there were tables open. We sat at the front of the restaurant, which only has 2 tables, the majority of the tables are in the back. The bar was very close to the front tables so the crowd kind of impinged on our eating space. Although the bar was crowded, it was very easy to communicate, which makes this a perfect date spot.The service speed is below average. It may have been because we were seated in the front and most tables were in the back. Our cocktails took about 15 minutes to make but it was probably due to the heavily populated bar. The appetizer and main entree were served quickly but the dessert took very long. In fact, we had made plans to meet with some friends and had a 20 minute window after finishing our entree for dessert, but actually had to inform them we had to leave because we were late for our evening festivities. They quickly informed us that there was problems with the fryer and that they would pack it up to go for us and take it off the check.We had the house salad with pear for the appetizer. It was pretty standard, nothing to fret about. I had the short rib pasta for my main entree. The ribs are boneless but they dont put much meat in the dish, which took away from the richness of the dish. A majority of the dish was pasta, which seemed to be homemade and was very tasty. You have the option of ordering the a dinner or appetizer portion. I ordered the dinner portion, which was very small, I cant imagine how small the Appetizer would be. My girlfriend had the crab cake appetizer portion. It was so small! We joked that we could have just picked it up and popped it in our mouth. The crab cake has no breading and is very rich with crab meat. I had a small taste of it but my girlfriend had to be frugal with my sample because of the small size of the dish. To finish we had the ricotta baguettes? My girlfriend and I had to eat these in the cab(see above) . They tasted like homemade donuts but we both agreed that there was no ricotta in them! Lastly, the mens bathroom door lock was broken. Being that I have a bad bladder when I drink, I basically got walked in on every time I was handling my business. There is one single toilet located in the basement. Very clean but please fix your lock! The hostess were very nice and apologized a number of times for the bathroom and slow dessert service, probably why they took the dessert off the check., great atmosphere and ambiance, great service, great drinks and service. ok food. make a reservation. cozy and tiny, probably great on one of those cold winter evenings., Went with a group of friends for restaurant week (#delayedreveiw) and we couldnt say enough good things about the place, food, atmosphere, and service. People around us probably thought it was our first time ever eating at a nice restaurant, since we could not stop raving about the food. From the deconstructed caesar salad to the braised pork to basil gnocchi, EVERYTHING was amazing. The waiter recommended the perfect dishes throughout the entire meal. I will definitely spread the word and will be returning soon. Thanks for a great night Unum!!, This is by far my favorite restaurant in DC. Pros: 1. Amazing customer service. Example: I called saying I would be 10 minutes late, and of course the receptionist was sweet and friendly. Elsewhere in DC, being 10 minutes late = cancelled reservation, especially on a busy Saturday night. Waitress was also very attentive and friendly. 2. Great location. So convenient, in the heart of Georgetown, but parking is still pretty accessible. 3. Decor. Very chic, contemporary, and cute. 4. FOOD! Most importantly, the food is amazing. My husband and I ordered the burger, chicken, and the truffled mac n cheese. The burger was delicious, the chicken was juicy and tender, and the truffled mac n cheese was the best truffled food item Ive ever had. 5. Drinks - Delicious! I ordered the grey goose pear martini which was divine. This restaurant really is the best of the best in DC and I can not wait to go back!, Oh Unum, you should change your name to OOO YUM :)Had to get the gnocchi again - mmm still little pillows of heaven, thank you for being just as delicious as the first time. Consistency is important to meTruffle mac and cheese - a little sad, because it wasnt as lovely as my first visit. Still a 4 stars thoughHanger steak - PERFECTLY COOKED. Thank you for being able to cook steak as the patron orders, medium rare! Perfectly perfectly cooked, ridiculously tender and did I mention, perfectly executed?? The radicchio was a little bit too strong for me (balsamic overpowering) but thats probably a personal preference.Will be back for that heavenly gnocchi and try other items next time :), Nice looking interior but seems they did not take into consideration noise buffering as it is loud in there. I like how the wine lists acknowledges good wines coming out of Oregon and Washington State. Cheese plate was tasty and I had a small bowl of the braised meat with pasta, yummy as well. My wife complained her Cesar salad was not much salad at all. For entree I had the monkfish stew and it too was a small portion size. My wife had the hamburger and luckily I was able to help her finish it off. Hamburger was undercooked but they were able to fix that. Wait staff was attentive., Reservations at a small and wildly successful restaurant like Unum are difficult to get and almost impossible to change. But after eating here just once, its easy to see why. The food here is delicious, wonderfully prepared, artfully plated and professional served by easygoing and knowledgeable waiters like William S. I had been looking forward to dining here for a month, and this restaurant was everything I had hoped for. I started with the delicious chorizo stuffed squid and ordered the braised Indian spiced lamb shank as a main course. Both were absolutely delicious. There were also quite a few tasty selections for my vegetarian companions. The wine list is excellent and, although I wasnt able to enjoy what looked like a creative bar on this visit, Ill make sure to check it out next time. The restaurant is small, and the later it gets the louder it gets....but its a small price to pay for a wonderful meal., We went to Unum on a Friday early evening and already needed a reservation. Our experience was very positive, the cocktails were competent, but not exceptional (my Mojito had quality ingredients and fresh mint). Our starter and main courses were very good, it was interesting to see modern American cuisine influenced by Italian cuisine rather than the normal Asian influence. But the charcuterie, the cheeses, hangar steak and everything else were really good. The only let down was the vanilla ice cream which was too creamy and did not have enough flavour., ** 3.5 stars ** - hear me out why!The Yelp bookmark was starting to get dusty on this one - I had waited long enough. So finally, made reservations for 4 people. It was late - around 10 pm when we walked in. Our server (I forgot his name ) was SUPER awesome and also very knowledgeable about the wine. We started with the bread basket - have no complaints about the cheesy crackers, but the loaf bread was kinda stale. We had the cheese plate and the server paired it with some delicious local VA wine. The paring made the cheese stand out and we were able to enjoy some great flavors. The beet salad was just out of this world yummy! Loved every bite of it. The roasted organic chicken was ok. let me say though - the roasted fingerling potatoes cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly. The chicken itself was a bit too tough and not cooked evenly enough.The rosemary gnocchi was also a big hit. I am not a big fan of gnocchi in general, but I would happily order this dish again. The truffle butter gave the dish a fuller flavor and the gnocchi texture was spot on,The grilled branzino was also pretty yummy. I felt the portion size was too small compared to the rest of our entrees, but the dish was still good. Not sure if I will order it again though. One of my friends also tried the Indian lamb shank and declared it yummy. The cashew cauliflower I tasted was pretty good. The spicy Japanese eggplant was actually one of the stars of our experience. Being a side, I was not expecting much, but trust me - everyone must try it! Was was cooked to perfection - tender but not falling apart and seasoned perfect. I love me a chef who can season his food properly - something so simple, yet so hard to master, sometimes!All the while, service was very attentive. My one gripe - the food was set on our table by the busboys, who did not really know what they were bringing in and they did not who had ordered what, which was kind of annoying and confusing at the same time. We had to wait for our server to point out the right dishes and then everyone was happy again. I am taking off a star for just that - it may be of little consequence, but given our party with dietary restrictions, it could have had major consequences with someone eating something other than what they ordered - hence the 3.5 stars.I will come back one of these days - the gnocchi beckons!! The place is on the higher end, so wont be doing that too often. However, kudos to the owners to keeping the place real, cozy and yummy while in the Georgetown jungle! :), Small, intimate and hip. A friend and I started with the cheese and chacuterie. Wonderful platings with jam, a rustic mustard and cornichons for the cheeses. We had to request bread but the plates were fabulous.I told our server from the beginning that we would be ordering 2 items at a time (this is a small plate for sharing venue or you can choose to order full entrees) and not to bring anything else until we had finished. So halfway through our cheese and chacuteri out comes our gnocchi and short ribs with tagliatelle. There wasnt even room to put the dishes on our table but because I had made it very clear, they kindly took them back to the kitchen. So a little bit of a rough start having to ask for bread and the waitress ignoring my explicit request regarding our dishes. From that point forward, we only ordered 2 dishes at a time so not to have a repeat of the food coming way too early.From here on, everything was wonderful. The gnocchi delicious, the short ribs with tagliatelle melted in your mouth. The quail on sauteed spinach with pistachio nuts very succulant and cooked perfectly. My friend loved the chorizo stuffed squid but I dont know if I would order that dish again (personal preference).We ended happily with the hanger steak cooked to perfection.Its a small wine list but very well selected. Turleys, Molly Dookers, etc. And the sommelier had some great suggestions as I wanted to try wines that arent in my cellar.The only real disappointment was the somewhat dry Mac & Cheese.Cant wait to return., my second favorite restaurant in the District. small. comfortable. quiet enough to enjoy a good conversation but busy enough to enjoy the buzz around you. the food is very good, especially the gnocchi - get the gnocchi seating tip - avoid the fishbowl in the window facing M street - the dining environment is more pleasant in the back of the restaurant. great wine list, My wife and I have eaten at Unum on several occasions. The level of service and consistency of superior food is what keeps bringing us back. It is a warm, cozy, and inviting place to have a bowl of pasta or a lamb chop and sip some nice Italian or French wine. You can tell the staff enjoys working there and the vibe permeates the restaurant. They make it easy to come back time and again., Nice for a date night. Cocktails were very good. Food was good, but nothing stood out., HIGHLIGHTS: Great waiter etiquette, romantic date atmosphere, thoughtful dishes with quality ingredientsLOLIGHTS: Crowded in the back, small portions for the gents, semi-slow serviceMost memorable: PEAR MARTiNI- THE MUST GETOther delectables tried: Beef short rib pasta - the gents appetizer (savory, tender, succulent morsels of beef, however even the dinner size was simply too small for my man), Crab Cakes - the girl dish (a load of real crab meat, bite-sized, well-worth the money) , ricotta beignets - the disappointment, enough said.Bonus: the bread and herbed-butter accompaniments just set the tone for the rest of the evening spent here... sooo good!Gentleman, if you are looking for the perfect restaurant to take your lovely lady friend, this is the place! Dim lighting, semi-crowded, great atmosphere, not too stuffy, quality ingredients, excellent execution, and good service. Three sections to choose from: bar, front, and back. The back tables are way too crowded and may compromise the privacy you may want on a date. Overall, my experience here was memorable and pleasant. The food was delicious but may be a little overpriced for the portion size in spite of the quality ingredients. You will definitely impress a lady here. You COULD possibly seal the deal if you take her here on your umpteenth date - just be sure to order her a pear martini. Overall, Il mos def come back for a drink and appetizer - your treat though ;), Ive walked by this place several times on my commute home and had always wanted to stop through for a drink and something to eat...well ladies and gentlemen I did and it was worth it!!!! Not only is the decor intimate, cozy, small, but its also full of friendly staff and a warm atmosphere. Im hoping its here to stay. I sat at the bar with my date and we split the following dishes (which were really good): rosemary gnocchi (large plate), which was really rich and hard for even two people with a big appetite to finish yet 100% delicious and worth trying, with a side dish of spicy Japanese eggplant (which wasnt too spicy for my weak spice self) just make sure you have your water ready in case. We also shared some of the cheeses and spreads that were on the menu. And what meal doesnt start off with a cocktail?.... The Bartlett Pear Martini was the perfect blend of pear and Vodka for my taste that evening and I can confidently say that I will be back for another,...just so I can have an excuse to try other dishes there as well., Excellent food, wine and service. Friendly waiter who took the time to discuss menu selections and suggestions. Very nicely done., The rating is for the experience, not for the food, which was very good. We arrived five minutes before the restaurant opened, after walking a couple of blocks through frigid temperatures and howling wind, to find the door locked and another group of patrons outside shivering. Standing on the street in bad weather while the staff consults their wristwatches on the warm side of the windows, fully aware of people outside waiting, is not what I expect of a fine dining establishment. Other restaurants with good food are far more welcoming and will be my choices in the future., For birthday dinner, Unum had been calling(trust us, we wouldnt be stalling)so a table for 2 was set,all signs point to perfect,and in love with this joint we were falling.Charcuterie is a lovely start,but what really stole our heartswere the option of small platesso we could have so many tastesand WOW, did Unum do its part.Shortrib pasta is completely worth eating.But the pomegranate duck is really a treating,getting your appetite whetfor that Indian lamb fete(the spinach and eggplant - delish - but unneeded).All in all, truly a success!This dinner was one of the best.Beautiful designand food that was divine.This is one of Georgetowns treasure chests., 5 STARS for this intimate, lovely, perfect Georgetown restaurant. I will call the theme of this review - Sure, no problem. 8pm table for 5 on a week night. Sure no problem!3 of us were late. They still sat the 2 on timers. Sure no problem!Knowledgeable, friendly waitress - Yay!Great champagne selection - Thank God! Let me taste it - Sure no problem! Yum--bring a bottle!Beautiful charcuterie app for me, salads for my 4 friends. All delectable. The chicken liver pate is beautiful. I try to avoid gluten, so I asked for some romaine leaves for my pate and they happily obliged. Sure no problem!I wasn starving so i perused the appetizer list and saw an oysters 3 ways item- but just wanted 12 raw on teh half shell. Our waitress checked with the kitchen to ensure they had enough left raw ... Sure no problem!Rowdy crowd we were. Never even a sideways glance from the staff. Sure no problem!We didn hear them call last call. Please let us have one more round? Sure no problem!We all loved this place - you will too. GO. NOW., We arrived an hour early for our reservation, planning to meet our friends for a drink at the bar, but they were able to seat us right away due to a cancellation. The service was fantastic, and my friends and I were able to linger over dinner for hours. The restaurant itself has a nice atmosphere and moderate noise levels. Im rating Unum with 4 stars because everyone in my group said their food was great. My husband loved his lamb main course, and thought the apple and celery soup was also very good. Unfortunately, I was a bit underwhelmed--particularly with my main course, the butternut gnocchi, which was rather bland. I wish they had more vegetarian main course options (if I recall, they also had only one fish option). For a special occasion, I would definitely go back if I saw more vegetarian and fish options on the menu., We got their cheese platter, oysters and had some wine. I would suggest mixing everything and tasting cheeses with other garnishes on the plate- it actually brings out the flavor of the cheese. The oysters- they make it and serve it 3 diff ways. I didnt like the fried kind... it was just not normal. The service was friendly and welcoming. Ambiance is upscale/classy. Would definitely be a date place., Decided to check out Unum recently for my girlfriend birthday, and can positively say it was one of the best meals/dining experiences Ie had in DC in the over two and a half years Ie spent here.Food: 1. We split the Unum salad to start, which was probably the only thing we had that was a bit of a letdown. While it was tasty and appropriately dressed, the salad was over 90% lettuce and only had two tiny pear slices and a few some cranberries speckled throughout. 2. We split two of the main dishes: the short rib pasta and the lamb shank - both were fantastic. The short rib was cooked to perfection and the pasta was some of the best Ie had in DC - it was lightly sauced and for being a small plate the portion was healthy. We were shocked at how massive the lamb shank portion was (a large bone with a huge swath of meat on top), and the meat fell off the bone and melted in our mouths. The side of grits (maybe?) was delicious, and the spinach was good, although it was served cold. Drinks: I had the Manhattan Love Story, which was an innovative mix of flavors that ended up being a lot better than how the mixture of whiskey and sake first sounds. My girlfriend had rose champagne, which she enjoyed.Service/Ambiance: The service was excellent - our waitress was prompt and polite, and we were seated in a great table immediately after arriving. The ambiance of the restaurant is somewhat rare for DC and altogether intimate and trendy; the lighting was perfect, the music wasn too loud, and the decor was modern. To top it off, the executive chef/owner (I believe) was greeting/thanking diners on their way out of the restaurant, which made for a nice touch. Price: Our bill for the above was only $71, which is significantly cheaper than it would be at many other DC restaurants. The fact that Unum offers most of their entrees as half plates allows diners to try a larger number of their best dishes for the same price, which is a great idea.I look forward to visiting again., Took my boyfriend to Unum for his birthday and could not possibly have had a better experience. The ambiance was fantastic, temperature inside perfect (it was snowing outside), wait staff was prompt and well-knowledged, with a great attitude and put up with our thousands of food questions. The food was EXCELLENT. I had the lamb and it was cooked perfectly, perfect serving size and good sides. My only suggestion is that the sauteed kale overpowers the dish a bit -- I didnt eat it. The rest was lovely. My boyfriend had the branzino and loved it as well. As soon as I stepped in the door, they were waiting for me and pulled to aside to ask if i preferred champagne or dessert for my boyfriends birthday, which just made it really special. Also, I LOVE that there are cheese and charcuterie options in addition to appetizers BEFORE the meal, as well as after. The cheese was excellent, as was the bread & butter/pesto that came free with dinner. The wine selection was also excellent, and the dessert tasty. Overall, definitely recommend Unum, especially for a special occasion. While a bit pricey, it was too be expected and we definitely got what we paid for! Overall 5+stars, hands down., Id heard good things and really wanted to like Unum. The decor is modern and warm with a stone wall and dim lighting. Unfortunately, the experience as a whole just fell short... Food was average (overpriced). Service was poor (ours, at least). My friend and I arrived for restaurant week dinner and were quickly seated. We both started with cheeses & charcuterie. The cheeses, chicken liver mousse, and meats were tasty enough. But our service was sadly very lacking. We watched as the group next to us had their table cleaned of all bread crumbs in between courses by their waitress...Then our waiter, who never once cleaned off the bread crumbs from our table, came up and took our plates without even acknowledging us or asking if we were done. He almost acted as if we were unimportant (not sure why, perhaps because we drank only water and declined the cocktail menu?).Our entrees were lackluster and again the service was almost non-existant and rude. Our waiter did not really address us at all, and only checked on us once during dinner. I liked that we were able to choose two small plates each for the entree portion. I got the short rib pasta and hanger steak. The short rib pasta was really tasty and the short rib meat was very tender. The hanger steak however, was extremely tough and it came with one (yes, ONE) small fingerling potato.... ?! My friend also felt one of her dishes was good and the other was very underwhelming. Also, no one gave me a steak knife, so I figured it was just an oversight and Id use my butter knife (should not have to do that in a nice restaurant). I finally had no choice but to ask for a steak knife because the meat was soo tough that a butter knife was clearly not going to cut it, in any sense of the phrase.The restaurant, while intimate with mood lighting, was LOUD. At times I felt like everyone around me was yelling. I found myself yelling to my friend just so she could hear me. It was amazing that such a small, seemingly intimate restaurant could be so boisterous.All in all, overpriced and overhyped. This review is based on a single experience... Id maybe give Unum one more shot, but so far, not impressed., I tried Unum for Restaurant Week. You can easily pass Unum if youre not looking for it. They could really use a sign overhead. Even the Guards next door, which I think is now closed, has a small sign overhead.The interior is hard wood floors and a nice ambiance. I got the celery soup, the hangar steak, quail, and bread pudding for dessert. Like other Yelpers, I also liked the option of choosing two smaller portion entrees over a single larger entree. I found the portion size a bit small overall but Ill attribute that to fine dinings small portions. My dining companion ate a bowl of ramen afterwards to fill up, heh.Its a little deceiving, but the Unum Restaurant Week menu was not available online via the Restaurant Week website, nor was it on the Unum website either until Restaurant Week was nearly halfway over. Part of the reason we picked Unum was b/c the menu on its website had lamb shank listed. Unbeknowst to us, this was not their Restaurant Week menu (which was not posted until after we ate here), so we showed up and the lamb shank wasnt part of their Restaurant Week menu. This was kind of a letdown but thankfully, there were other perks.The celery root soup has a very smooth texture, very pleasing to the mouth. The flavor of the quail was nice but I especially liked the flavor of the sauteed spinach underneath it. The pistachio nuts and dates with the spinach added a nice touch. The hangar steak was good too, but I really just got two very small pieces. Even worse, like one Yelper mentioned, there was only a single fingerling potato. It was sliced in two but completely black. It seemed overcooked. The hangar steak was sitting on some sort of sour lettuce, which was burned black and didnt taste good at all. I was rather disappointed by this.The bread pudding was pretty good, but a little too sweet for me. It had a scoop of lemon-buttermilk ice cream on top, which sounds appealing bc of its novelty but in practice, tasted really sour. Even though vanilla might be a plainer flavor, I think that have paired better with the bread pudding.Overall experience wasnt bad but I think a few things were lacking (like having the Restaurant Week menu up on the website in a timely fashion, not having burnt lettuce and black fingerling potato). Otherwise, I liked the ambiance and the rest of the food was pretty good., Excellent flavors in a very intimate setting., Time of Review: *February 9 @ 6:30pm, dinner for 5Unum is a cozy (i.e. small, but not crowded feeling) restaurant with lighting that sufficiently create a nice ambiance without putting me to sleep!Service: * Waiter - He was fairly attentive and service was generally good. My only wish was that he wouldve asked me before refilling my soda since they were not free.Food Quality/Selection: * In terms of restaurant week value, I felt Unum exceeded my expectations. I started with the Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese & Black Truffle Salami, both delicious but nothing mind blowing. You got to choose 2 half entrees or 1 large entrees. Depending on what you ordered, the half entrees were decently sized - the Grilled Hanger Steak was large, while the Grouper, Quail and Squid dishes were what I wouldve expected a half sized entree to be. All were delicious! Finally, I finished with the bread pudding, which was a bit more on the citrusy side and contained raisins which I are just 2 things I personally do not prefer in bread pudding.Check out my instagram account for photos of the dishes - lilylinphotos!Cost: * Restaurant week prices ~$35/person excluding sides and drinks.Parking: Its M Street / Georgetown, need I say more? Either be prepared to pay for a garage or metered spot or be willing to driving around the neighborhoods to find one., One of the best restaurants in Georgetown. Small intimate restaurant run by a husband and wife - she runs the front and he is the chef. Food is very creative and cooked with care and great ingredients. Food sampled includes the quail, very nicely done and tasty, duck done in nice earthy tones, short rib pasta expertly done, terrane of rabbit and blu cheese for small plate appetizers. Everything first rate. Noise level ranges from quiet to moderate. Moderate prices., Great food!! The shirt rib pasta is right tasty! And the Chimichurri is amazing!! My hats off to the chef! Keep up the good work!!, Easily one of my new favorite DC restaurants! The BF took me here for Valentines day and I left wishing I had room to eat more. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. Truffle Mac & Cheese is a MUST. And despite being a side, the portions are generous. He got the short rib pasta and I got the gnocchi - both amazing (though the short rib pasta was better). Despite not having any more room to eat, we got the beignets for dessert and they were wonderfully warm and moist. Will definitely be going back! Just a tip- if planning on ordering appetizers/sides, definitely opt for the half portions for dinner plates, as the pasta can be really heavy (or take some home with you)., What a great addition to the Georgetown restaurant scene! Wonderful menu and I love the half portion option on the entrees. For a more intimate, refined, yet vibrant dining experience, Unum is the place., This might have been one of the best non-sushi meals Ive ever had. I went out for dinner with my mom, and we both immediately fell in love with the decor and layout of the space. The service was great as well. I love that Unum offers half portions because we got to taste a few different items even though there were only two of us. The bread was great, and came with sage butter and cilantro chimichurri. My mom had a glass of one of the chardonnays, and it was very round and buttery - a little too much for me, but my mom loved it. I had a glass of the pinot grigio, and it was fine. Nothing special, but good for $8.To start, we ordered the spicy Japanese eggplant side as an appetizer, and it was delicious - sweet with an occasional kick of spice. My mom got the gnocchi, and they were light and incredible. I got half-orders of the short rib pasta and the branzino, and both were absolutely amazing. The short rib pasta had a lot of meat, but somehow it wasnt completely overpowering. The fish came with a shaved fennel salad and a celery root puree. All of the flavors were mild, and came together to create perfect, delicate bites. For dessert, we got one scoop of homemade lemon buttermilk icecream. It was a perfect mouthful (or 5) to end the meal.
