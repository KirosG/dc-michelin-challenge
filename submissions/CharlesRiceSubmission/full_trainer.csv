0|42-grams-chicago|I've heard great things about sous rising and i was really impressed with the level of food served here. The food is a nice balance between creativity, playfulness and taste. The followings are what I had:  Amuse Juniper Jump Potato Soup Beet Salad Tom Yum Flavor of the sea Catalina Island Uni SweetBread Duck Breast Foie Gras Chocolate Sweets Cheese 3 waysIf you have a chance to go, you definitely won't regret it. Also, the restaurant is practically run by the chef and his wife and its interior is decorated like someone's living and dining room, which put you at ease (I did the chef's counter and it brings me to the good days when I ate at my mom's kitchen. The communal table is set like a family dining table). Hence, it really does feel like you're going to someone's house to eat., Absolutely fantastic!We went with a group of 5 friends and sat at the Chef's counter on Saturday night. As recommended, we brought a Sauv Blanc and several reds including a pinot, malbec, cab and brachetto. We actually skipped the malbec and cab in place of one of our server's, Emily's, recommendation to pair the brachetto instead starting with the foie gras dish. It was a fantastic reco and I would definitely suggest bringing a lighter dessert wine like that to not overpower the dishes once you're past the meat courses.The space is great - cozy without being crowded - very sleek and romantic. It was so much fun to chat with Chef Jake, his sous chef Tom, Chef's wife Alexa and server Emily while we ate and drank. The food was absolutely fantastic - but I think Chef may have a future in cocktails too as the amuse was an amazing jellified (I don't think that's a word) Hendrick's, cucumber and hibiscus concoction. Definitely eager to go back!, 'just had a fabulous dinner. intimate setting and wonderful food. creative and beautiful. felt like eating in a private home with your own wines and personal chef. go now before you have to wait for months to get in.', My husband surprised me with dinner here to celebrate my 42nd birthday...how apropos! The experience was extremely enjoyable. It began with a warm welcome by Alexa who served as hostess and kept us at ease and informed. The other diners were pleasant and the setting was relaxing yet elegant. The evening was perfectly paced and the food was delicious! As the finale, Chef Jake thanked us at the table and we had the chance to discuss his course preparations. As residents of Uptown, it's exciting to have this addition to our neighborhood to further expand our diverse and unique restaurant options! They even personalized my copy of the menu with a birthday message. I would absolutely recommend 42 grams!, 'This was literally one of the best meals of my life. So creative. So friendly. So warm and the food is out of this world, Ie been to almost every Next meal, and all the other greats. But this place is a not to miss. Get tickets now! (and watch out for the crazy beautiful wonderful things these people do to beets and tiny flowers and everything else).', 'The place is a welcome addition to the Uptown Neighborhood. The food is on par with the big name places already in town (Alinea, Schwa, etc.). Even better than the food was the experience. It is very intimate and you get to spend a lot of time talking with the chef and his wife (hostess). They really make you feel like you are enjoying dinner in their kitchen/living room. They did a nice job explaining the food and the best approach to tackling each dish.Because of the intimate environment, the minimal seating and the type of food, this place is not good for children. It is better to schedule the babysitter and take your partner for that special night out. It is a fine dining experience in a casual environment, I would say sexy casual. My one complaint, which is not enough to drop a star, was that the beginning of the meal felt a little rushed. It is difficult when they serve everyone together so if you are not all part of the same party, eating at different paces can be tough. This seemed to correct itself as the meal went one.The current menu has a strong Asian influence to it. I overhead that the menu will change come spring. This is definitely a place to save up for and then sit back and enjoy.', Simply a fantastic dining experience.Alexa and Jake were wonderful hosts, essentially welcoming us (and a few other people) to join them in their restaurant. The space is open and welcoming, where everything is visible. We sat at the bar, where we were able to interact with other guests and the staff. Alexa in particular was engaging throughout, both explaining each of the 15 courses and chatting about any topic that came up. The music mix completely undercut any possible tone of pretentiousness, again giving the whole feel one of comfort and inclusion.And then there's the food. Jake's background at Charlie Trotter's, Alinea, and Schwa are evident, though his culinary voice is his own. There were no wrong notes the entire evening, though plenty of highlights (soup, salmon w/ trout roe and dashi, a coconut tom yum dumpling, the sweetbread, dessert, and coffee). Really, each course was a standout. We loosely followed the wine suggestions with a Chablis, a young red Burgundy, and an auslese riesling, and it all came together beautifully.We'll certainly be back in coming months - looking forward to Jake's summer menu!, 'Enjoyed my time at the Chef Counter on Friday night. Alex was charming and each course was nothing short of ethereal. (Strong work, Chef Jake!) My date doesn drink, so they were very gracious about substituting the gelee in his juniper jump, no problem.I enjoyed the small group atmosphere and interacting with the Chef. Even though the experience is pricey (Around $207/seat), it was worth it. Also, it was nice to pre-pay, so when youe done with dinner, you can totally jam out.Just a quick note: while I was full at the end of the night (5/120), my date (6/205) needed some additional sustenance. (Not sure if this is a tall dude/small woman issue, but something to think about.) I thought the portions were perfect, but the date wanted a bigger hunk of duck. Overall, I would totally go again. Amazing food. Great ambiance. And, they have spare pashminas for ladies who are chilly. :)', A simply amazing experience. Chef Jake and his wife Alexa make an amazing team. The 15 course dinner was so unique and a true culinary delight. I can't wait to go back., 'I had a pleasure of being introduced to Jake creations about a year ago when him and his lovely wife Alexa hosted their dinner guests right in their home. The venue was called Sous Rising and it quickly became popular in the Chicago foodie community. Those who appreciate fine dinning were genuinely impressed with Jake magic ability to produce his eatable masterpieces (which could stand up to Alinea finest courses) out of his conventional home kitchen. With this said, when I learned that my boyfriend was taking me to 42 grams, I dragged our friends along, practically guaranteeing them a culinary experience of a lifetime... And it was just that! Food Jake kept some of his staples (only fine-tuning them to perfection) The winners included the potato soup (may I add with white sturgeon caviar?!), duck three ways, the mind blowing sweetbread, the cheese in the class paradise, the honey cream ball and the beet macaroon which replaced one of my former favorites called 24 hour beet... (even better!) It was super neat that almost every course had a sentimental story behind it... kind of like the Trotter bite, made in the memory of Charley Trotter and served in the original china from his restaurant - Bravo!Atmosphere Alexa made us feel right at home, while introducing every course caring through Jake culinary passion. They both came out and spoke with all of us at the end, Emily was incredibly knowledgeable about wine. Elegant but not stuffy, 42 grams has a trendy but some-what casual feel, with hand-picked eclectic decorative accents. If you want to taste outstanding, professionally prepared and artfully presented dishes but still be able to laugh all night - 42 grams is a perfect choice.', 'Amazing food, owners are amazing, this is my new favorite place in the city!!!! The food is a work of art. Love that you have your whole meal in less than 3 hours and the portions are perfect size! Will be coming back!', Nice. Recommended - but no tap water please!Solid 7/10. But since I had given Elizabeth a 3 star, i do the same here (oh, my -- taking myself a bit too seriously)I went by myself testing the place to see if i wanted to take my family next time.Also, let's be honest -- it's cheaper for one than 4 people. So i came out ahead. literally and figuratively.Pleasant people. In fact so nice, i had to wait two days to write this up.Really clean place. The area is so so but I reckon this is the fashionable thing.Street parking for two hours so you need to go back 2/3 of your meal and re-do the parking. There may be some larger parking spots around.My water tasted too chemical...i asked the server if it were filtered. He said no. Luckily they had their perrier. All dishes were done cleanly and beautifully. All the chefs seemed like they had just taken their shower. Despite me loving dives, i really enjoy the cleanliness.The soup was delicious.The greens in the salad were not impressive but all else including the beetroot beautifully done.The fish was delicious.Salmon nigiri. Nothing to write home about. The Uni (and by the way Uni is probably my favorite order when i go to sushi bars and this is how i test them) was ok. The idea of brioche and all that was nice.Veal sweetbread. OkDuck. I have had much better but again beautifully done. Somehow i think my piece was not as good as the other people's.Foie Gras. Excellent.Dark choco. fine.pecorino in three forms, nice idea.Chicory, cardamom. nice.Overall recommended. I go back but not with the family as i do not think my gorgeous son will have much to eat there.Talking about much to eat. I felt a bit hungry when i left.I am glad they are in Chicago and sincerely wish them the best.Loved the music selection.Not a first date type of place as everyone seemed to feel they had to talk to the (new) person next to them.Value. about $200 all inclusive per person. I'd say a bit on the high side but considering all the staff there, they deserve every penny they make.Now, i have to go back to Elizabeth again and compare. Fairness is a good excuse.I really liked it that when i left the chef walked me to the door. Incredibly polite gesture. Higher class restaurants in japan normally do this and i have always liked it because despite my upbringing, i have a polite DNA., 'What a wonderful experience! Intimate, delicious and run by 2 very lovely people. Their courses were paired with an INSANE spotify playlist which just puts them over the top. What a fabulous hidden gem.', 'I think this place has a lot of potential, but right now they need to work in three areas relative to the top tier restaurants: 1) service interactivity, 2) balance of the meal and 3) small service detailsFirst of all, none of this reflects on the quality of the dishes chef Jake made, which I considered interesting and inventive and in the top tier level and Il explain that (food, 4.5 stars). Things that I liked: food, food, food. Juniper Jump was an extremely inventive cocktail with a solid-ish hendricks gin. Can they do this in a BYOB? I think this is a legitimate question, as we self-provided for a certain expectation in time and presentation. the cucumber felt like 100 ways dish was genius and played on many trends in fine dining. The asparagus gelato topping majama de Atun was one of my favorites ever, but I think they should have put it at the end, not the beginning, as it felt dessert-y. The coconut dish, percorino were too small, even for a delicious bite.  The pork belly taco dish was a very inventive take on a taco deconstructed. Genius. I didn taste any notable truffle in the grain and seed dish. Sometimes the dish ingredients were announced before the table attention was on the host, and as a result, I found myself guessing several times until the menu was provided at the end.  The crispy snacks on the table were good, and if this place wasn pristinely clean, this would have bothered me. Our obnoxious neighbors appears to be disassembling the table-piece as they got drunker. The kale chip in particular was interesting and the right size. Things that annoyed me:  I left-handed. Alexa, the wife of Jake, noted this on the way in. But her server did not note this, twice, unannouncedly bumping into my left arm with a plate instead of serving the plate from the right, where I sat, an unobstructed way to bring the dish in. In one case my spoon almost was knocked off the table and in a second case, my hand hit a plate and I was annoyed with the infraction throughout the course. This was not, with the exception of the A5 Wagyu a $200 meal in terms of ingredients. Notably absent from the menu relative to these other reviews were a lot of the things that we were looking forward to, and perhaps expecting. No foie gras, no dark chocolate, no veal, etc. I left hungry, only masked by the alcohol *we* had provided (and were served). Speaking of alcohol, we were asked to surrender the wines at the beginning, which might be an infraction of the byob rules for Chicago, I would have thought they be more attentive to this detail. I didn appreciate being called a party table by Alexa at the beginning, a detail that seems to impose a one-sized-fits-all approach to our members.  The host directed to sit at one end of the table upon entry, in a manner that increased the segregation of us with the communal party throughout the meal. The lack of communal explanation brought the experience down a bit. The 7 basically ignored us with the exception of some niceties. I got to retrieve my own coat at the end, after finding it. The top tier of restaurants is accustomed to interactivity with the patrons. Twice I hinted at that within ear shot of the hosts, once noting a recent article in Crains where the diners were actually researched before the meal. Having this interpersonal wall up for the service irked me as I felt left 100% to my party.  I know they are starting but while I liked the stemware very much (interesting actually) and the plateware (Trotter plates, cool idea, yes please), I did not like the silverware (plain for a place of this price-point). Several dishes we were provided with nothing more than a spoon and I could have used a knife to work off of, not just my finger.  They ended with a coffee dish. I do not like coffee and nor do lots of people. Ie never seen a place force the patrons into a coffee dish instead of asking if they would like it.  The table could easily be out another foot from the wall to prevent the feeling that I was almost bumping into the other patrons each time I needed to use the restroom. I felt myself ducking between the interesting wine cork wall that protruded and not bumping a few of the guys in the 7 party that had chairs kind of sticking out. I did like the chairs they picked and found them top tier worthy.  The decor in this place is an Elizabeth restaurant rip-off, woodland table bouquet and open stainless steel. I usually expect something visually new at $200.I think almost all of these attributes that I had issues with can be corrected. I look forward to trying this place again in 6 months or a year when they get into their service stride. I think it is a welcome addition to Uptown.', For my first ticketed 10+ course restaurant I was quite excited to visit 42 grams for a friends birthday on a Friday evening. We opted to go with the later seating at the communal table. It was the 3 of us and a party of 7 friends (we didn't know) making up the table of 10. Arriving first we were opted to sit at one end of the table so we could sit together. I liked this option as sometimes you may not like the other people. But we actually were talking quite a bit with a few of the others. The BYOB aspect is very nice. Loved it. And loved the stemware!The food - AMAZING. But being a hearty eater, I wished there was more of it. Especially the main course of wagyu beef which was only a small cube. With just having 14 courses, I wasn't full. I agree with the other review about the silverware. A little plain. And they normally just have you a spoon when a fork, spoon and knife were warranted. It was hard to savor the course cutting it with a spoon. We brought bubbly, white and red wines. They all were poured with the balancing courses. That I loved as well. Dinner takes about 2.5 hours but it flew by. I would definitely return for next seasons menu., 'The food was excellent but a bit pricey. My preference is to have a shorter explanation from a waiter on the food and perhaps in a more quiet tone. It was not a relaxing experience for me, as I felt like I was at a food workshop lecture.', I had the best single dish I've ever had at this restaurant. I think everyone dining with me agreed, the kobe A5 course made its mark on everyone. Few pointer/tips: Only a communal table is offered for seating. So I recommend you book with at least 4 people to have the best time and not sit with random people.The environment is very casual, not stuffy at all. That being said, the service is casual as well. Leave your pretentiousness at the door. Some people may not enjoy this for the price they pay. Which is why I recommend going with a group and just enjoy. It did not bother me in the least bit. I'm rather laid back.It is a very small restaurant with only 4 people staffing. 2 in the kitchen and 2 out. This is rather impressive when you consider how intricate every dish is and the prep work for each. I love that it was BYOB. You can bring multiple different bottles, which I did.They change the menu. I would definitely go again once the menu changes.Multiple courses are remarkable. Out of all the tasting menus I've had this one is definently at the top of the list for taste and quality. Lower down for value., 'Amazing experience last night at the communal table. Food was super creative and most importantly, super tasty. Some highlights were the Asparagus Gelato w/ Cured Tuna & the Carnitas Taco....All in all a great evening with great hosts and great food. Can wait for the next menu this fall....Just go.', 'An intimate and adventurous experience. All fourteen courses had at least one element that was new for me. Top three courses; Asparagus Gelato with smoked Tuna, Waygu Beef with Bone Marrow powder and Pork Belly carnitas.The food is very salty, and I love salty food. Drink a lot of water!Chef Jake and his wife are very gracious and you feel like you are in their home. I sat at the counter with my friend and nine others. I loved talking to the other diners and sharing feedback on the food.Our wines were poured in a timely matter and great music played all evening.This is a great experience, and well worth the $200 price tag.', 'I really enjoyed dining at the counter. I suggest sitting on the left side so you can get the best view of the chef prepping the plates right in front of you. And I really like how the atmosphere is more laid back and relaxed. They encourage asking questions and make it clear that they are totally fine with picture taking. I was extremely surprised that their suggested wine pairings were also ridiculously affordable. Also, Alexa was very helpful and accommodating when I needed help swapping reservations. And of course, the food was awesome and inventive. Overall, it was a great experience.', Had the pleasure of being in 42 Grams first seating for their spring/summer set menu back in late May. Overall a really fantastic dining experience and a very welcome addition to the Uptown neighborhood. Our experience was at the communal dining table of 10. I can understand that this can be a hit or miss experience depending on who the other diners are when you are seated but my hubby and I really lucked out by being seated across from a friendly couple from out of state who no surprise happened to be foodies like us. The other party of 8 were sort of cordial, a little obnoxious but overall kept to themselves. 42 Grams is BYOB so I appreciated that the host/co-owner communicated with us in advance regarding what types of wines would pair well with their set menu. They suggested 2-3 bottles of wine for a party of two to be served over the course of our 2.5 hour meal. We found this to be way to much for us and would have been plenty happy with a bottle of white since the first half of the menu was very light and seafood oriented. A half bottle of red would have been plenty to round out the last third of the meal which was heavier. I'd say the vast majority of the dishes served were home runs with maybe one or two dishes that weren't bad by any means but I guess a little disappointing since the other dishes blew us away. This was the very first run on their new seasonal menu so I would anticipate that Jake, the chef and owner, continued to refine and tweak each dish to make it better. My hubby and I still think about a few of the dishes we were served: a savory asparagus ice cream served over tuna (sounds disgusting but fabulous), a deconstructed pork belly taco, and an out of this world wonderful galangal spice cake dessert. We've had the pleasure to have eaten at some many great restaurants like El Ideas, Elizabeth, Goosefoot, Grace, Moto and with the exception of maybe Alinea this was one of our favorite meals., 'This is definitely a special occasion place. Everything we had was outstanding! Enjoyed the personal/cozy atmosphere and enjoyed hearing about every dish in detail. Will be recommending to friends!', One of the best meals I've ever had in Chicago, right up there, if not better than Alinea, Next, Grace, etc. Each course was interesting, had great depth and separation of flavor, yet tasted pure. We sat at the Chef's counter, and I really enjoyed the set-up, with each course presented to everyone at the same time. Alexia was an engaging speaker, and described each course wonderfully without that feeling of recitation that you get at so many fine dining restaurants.I won't describe the courses since other reviewers have already done that, but I will say that 75% of the course were knockouts, and the rest were simply very delicious.The week prior to our reservation we received an email confirmation with a description of wines that might be suitable as pairings. That was really helpful and we were able to find wines similar to the descriptions and they paired very well indeed., This had to have been the best meal of the year! The space is warm and inviting. You feel as though you've been invited over to dinner. The food was innovative and evoked so many textures, flavors, colors and scents. I would rate this place higher than Alinea., 'This is the kind of correspondence you should expect from the owners of 42 Grams if you yelp anything that they don appreciate: I just received a third comment from the team at 42 Grams. I reposting these comments for everyone entertainment. Comment #1: Hi Athanasios, Jake B. sent you a message on Yelp:Subject: Your ReviewThank you Nas,I really loved it that you lowered your 2 stars to 1 star. It proves that Yelp is as good as it reviewers. I hope you enjoyed your Coke in a sippy cup and a movie (Frozen?).Moreover, I enjoyed cooking for your wife (girlfriend) and that she had an amazing time. She was an amazing person. Send my regards. Cheers,JakeComment #2Comment from Jake B. of 42 grams Business Owner10/20/2014 Nas,We appreciate your review with all respect. We just firmly believe in people that aren running across the street for Coke after we started service and on their phone every other minute while their partner is elbowing you in embarrassment to stop. You posting such a review doesn surprise us one bit. You came in with an agenda and you are following through. We just wish that you had the same passion for your dinner as you do for your Coke, movies, and Yelp reviews. This is a place of business, but we are two kind people that took excellent care of you and your company at 42 grams. Once you attack us with false statements, we will respond. (A reminder: You coulde told us you issues in person. We are both directly in front of you. And, when I made eye contact with you, you had to look away in shame).I hope this helps and shows that Yelp is a terrible idea to let certain diners let loose with their amateur opinions on such a global public forum.Comment #3Nas you have 0 friends on Yelp BTW, (Im glad you call yourself that like your a cool hip hop star) Please don come back. I don want to elaborate why. Just stay home. Thanks.Message Jake B.My original post:The food was good, not great. The Chef is clearly talented - i just not that into asian flavors. The main problem is with the front of house. The host/server is the Chef wife. She talks through the course, her overly long stories seem wooden. And when i asked for a soda, she directed me across the street to a bodega; other higher end restaurants just send someone to get you a can of coke. I was so disappointed. The only bright side of the meal is that we went through 13 courses in record time, i was able to catch a good movie afterward. I probably won go back.', 'My husband and I came here last weekend for our wedding anniversary. We live close by and had heard great things, so for the first big event we had, we knew we check out 42 Grams.I was blown away. There was one course (the wagyu beef) that literally had me speechless for a few minutes. The level of detail and thoughtfulness that comes with each course was amazing. We used Alexa grandmother silver once or twice. Plates from Charlie Trotter were used in an ode to him. I lefthanded, and Alexa set each course for my ultimate comfort. Chef used spent grain leftover from the brewing process to make a toast that was unbelievable. And the coffee course was a fun surprise!The atmosphere is somehow upscale yet completely comfortable. Alexa, co-owner, is a delight. I really enjoyed chatting with her. And Chef Jake was super laid back and friendly-- the two of them made the night incredible.As of today(!!) 42 Grams has 2 Michelin stars-- and they haven even been open a year! I look forward to returning as often as I can. Congratulations, Jake and Alexa. You absolutely deserve all the accolades!', 'I decided this was where I wanted to celebrate my birthday (two weeks from now) The gal I spoke to on the phone was very sarcastic and rude when I asked if they could please ensure we were not seated with any candles on our table due to the fact that my mother was recovering from a serious illness and required oxygen. She hinted that maybe she should just stay home. I was appalled, are you kidding me? At this point I knew there was no way I was going to eat here. I decided to check the reviews and I am *SO* glad I did. I find it helpful to read the worst reviews of a business to see if people are just whining or if they had a genuinely regrettable experience. That when I stumbled upon the review by Athanasios K. and in it, the comments and messages by the business owners made me sick. These people commented about his wife and how she was an amazing person. Wait, what? The business owner, Jake B. then went on to insult him regarding his opinions as amateur. He goes on to tell him ...don come back. I don want to elaborate why. Just stay home. Well Jake, here a newsflash for you; I planned on dining here for my birthday and if it was as amazing as it should be, I was going to book your establishment for my firm holiday gala. Since your fine dining experience comes with a high price but low morals (and spelling, your a cool hip hop star) Il go ahead and pass. Happy holidays.*******************UPDATE 12/5/14***************************There is nothing fraudulent or made up about my review at all and the owner wife is just upset because despite their tactics, I have refused to remove my review. I sorry that you lack any human decency and it wonderful that youe tried (AND FAILED) to defend your awful business practices and worse customer service. It really is a shame that such talent accompanies such a business.What kind of person lies about their mother having a serious illness? Worse, what kind of trash accuses someone of lying about it? Shall I post a photo of my mom? Will that make you feel better? Wow. Just wow. My ailing mother has lung disease and had battled cancer. Twice. Disgusting.******Another update because Alexa is a freaking psycho****Do you really think it appropriate to speak to someone that way where anyone could see it? Do you think that this is going to sway potential customers in your favor? What is wrong with you? Hurling insults at me as if you are a juvenile. I would expect this type of behavior from a teenager at Taco Bell but you, the MARVELOUS ALEXA, I appalled. So back to my review... This woman (as if she behaves like an adult) expects you Yelpers to believe that I would fabricate such an in depth story just because... I have nothing to gain by reviewing your restaurant negatively darling and if I did, I can assure you I have more class than to bring my mother into things. I sorry that you lack not only customer service skills but also any human decency. It really is a shame. I have reached out to associates with the local news stations and the newspaper. I will not be bashed upon by some lunatic owner. Calling me out? Morals? Best joke Ie heard all week. I wish you all the best in your business ventures and truly hope that you learn from your mistakes in the way that youe handled my personal experience and review. I did my homework on the establishment and that why I chose it over Alinea. Again, shameful.', 'It took me a while to write this review (I visited in July), but I would like to share my perfect experience at 42 grams. I came here with my husband and parents, who are (like me) not from the US. We received a very warm welcome by Alexa and Alexa was one of the reasons we had such a great experience. The food was really special, beautifully presented and really tasteful. We had the weirdest combinations, thing you would never think about. My parents do speak a bit English, but every course Alexa waited until my husband and I explained the ingredients to them, to make sure they understood what they were eating, which I found very thoughtful. It made me (and my parents) feel very comfortable. Also, it was very fun to see the chefs at work. I agree with the Michelin star- crew: they really deserved their stars!', Wow. Just wow. Get there before you can't. Only 18 seats per night, 4 nights a week.So impeccably prepared - not just tthe aesthetics, but the flavors were just incredible. From the porky salt-cured tuna loin packed with umami, to the elevated comfort food of crunchy cultured barley with pork jowls and pork heart over grapefruit, to the silky salmon on spent barley bread, and of course the wagyu filled with pockets of fat... all of it was amazing. I personally enjoyed the savories more than the sweets, but everything was outstanding.Michelin stars well deserved!, 'Let me start by saying that while we have been fortunate enough to dine at many of the top-rated restaurants in Chicago and throughout the country, we are similarly as pleased with friends at home and our own jerk chicken or pulled pork. So, while we really appreciate fine dining, we don live for it.I booked this dinner based solely on the Michelin stars. I knew nothing about it, and their website is relatively scant in detail. Their instructions are quite precise - arrive within a 15-30 minute window, and they will not make substitutions. It was only when we arrived (we were the last couple), that all of their rules made sense. Everyone is sitting together, and unlike other communal tables, everyone is served the same course at the same time. So, if youe late to your reservation, youe messing up with everyone dinner. Admittedly, this concept will not work well for some people. However, it was fantastic to us. The primary reason most people go to a fine dining restaurant is to have (hopefully) amazing food that different and new. 42 grams fires on all cylinders here. While the super high-tech display of an Alinea is not here, the amazingly creative flavors, textures, and presentation makes such display unnecessary. Pacing is perfect, allowing everyone to eat, but not be rushed or sit around. As a result, you leave satiated, but not exploding full or hungry.To me, one of the biggest compliments to a chef is when my wife, who is a fairly picky eater, finishes something she would not normally eat. Caviar and salmon are perfect examples of this, as are sweetbreads, pig heart, etc. Not only did she try these things, she finished them, and in several cases would have wanted more. Also, in my experience, most chefs are either main course chefs or pastry chefs, not both. With 2 people in the kitchen, this team pulls off both great main course meals and equally memorable desserts. What makes this restaurant especially unique, though, is the atmosphere. Because everyone sits together and eats at the same time, it is intimate. Candidly, we did not speak with the people next to us, but we could have if we chose; and we did not appear rude because we did not. More so, though, the fact that the chef wife, Alexa, is your tour guide of sorts, makes the name all make sense. Jake and Alexa are essentially inviting you into their home to make you a meal. They each work with their strengths - Jake with the cooking, Alexa with the speaking, but you feel like youe been invited into someone home. Granted, you are paying for it, but it is an atypical experience for a restaurant. Again, not everyone will like this, but we loved it. Since most fine dining restaurants are a bit cold - sterile atmosphere, often pretentious or distant service, and focus on show over relationship, this came as a pleasant surprise. Had I read my own review before going, I might have been turned off by this, but it works really well - at least with this couple.As for the negative reviews (which I read last night before going for the first time) - one is from someone who didn attend the restaurant. While it appears there are some major life issues there, I can speak to what happened between them. The bottom line, though, is the couple I met were gracious, inviting, and I actually tasted the food, so take that for what it worth. The other - again, the back-and-forth doesn make much sense, but if you read between the lines, you can see what happened. If you invite me over to your house for dinner, and I act like I don really want to be there, appear angry or put out because you don meet my needs, etc., does that make you a bad host or me a bad guest? You can decide that for yourself, but again, based on my experience, if you aren demanding or pretentious (and maybe even if you are), this experience will be great.I can honestly say that there is currently no better restaurant in Chicago for the money and the experience, and at the risk of sounding pretentious myself, I am comparing that to restaurants (some of which have closed) including: Alinea; Grace; Goosefoot; Elizabeth; L20; Charlie Trotter; Tru; Sixteen; Blackbird; Naha; North Pond; Topolobampo, etc.If you have the means, and are trying to figure out where to go; and even more so, if youe open to this type of an experience, get reservations as soon as you can, as you won be able to much longer.', This is a unique place and an expensive place at the same time. This is one of those places where you prepay and there is only limited seating. Because of the limited seating you will potentially share the table with strangers. Luckily we were able to book the entire restaurant so no dining with strangers. Some people enjoy that but I personally don't especially if the meal can go as long as 3 hours. We didnt notice the hours since we were enjoying the food and company The star of this restaurant is Alexa, she is the hostess and she is also the wife of chef Jake. She handles the social part of this business very well. She responds to all your questions via email and if you have special REASONABLE AND DOABLE requests, she is the person you need to talk to. If it can be done she will let you know. 5 stars to AlexaThe location is in uptown and the facade of the restaurant is nothing special but once you go inside, the ambiance changes to casual elegance. I very much like the personalized service you get at this place. Now for the food, I think we had a 14 course dinner. I have to say there were 3 or 4 dishes that blew my mind, maybe 2 or 3 that I didnt care for and the rest were simply delicious. 4 stars for the food. Would I recommend this place? Absolutely, I thought it was a great experience. Would I be back? Maybe., Like you need to read my review....they just got 2 Michelin stars. We had great conversations with everyone we me there and the food was amazing. They even wrote a nice little note on my menu for my birthday. I'll be back for the next menu for sure!, Wow. That's really all you need to know. Incredibly unique experience, all 13 courses we had were perfect, BYOB, what more could you want.... Jake and Alexa are clearly insane, and thank God, or Whoever smiles down on incredible food, for it., The marriage of flavors in each dish was amazing. Alexa's descriptions of each course were brilliant. The dining experience was beautiful. Go here with friends and you will make more friends by the end of the night., 'Tell us about the preparation of this dish, Chef Jake.It was really simple.... No it wasn! At all! :D42 grams is a very unique and wonderful dining experience. There is a maximum of 10 people in the restaurant at any given time, so the service you receive is very warm and personal, and the attention to detail in the food is impeccable. Alexa even learned everyone name on the way in and addressed us accordingly during the meal. You can get up and walk around, and you can even walk right up to the pass and ask Chef what going on. There is almost nothing I can say about the food because everything was great. The biggest highlight for me was the sweetbreads. I order sweetbreads a lot, and these were the best Ie ever had in my life. The unique and crunchy char was mind blowing. Also, the Salmon with spent grain bread and mushroom dashi was insane. Just, crazy. Get here while you still can! The man got talent. The only minute detail I didn like was I wish there was a bit more direction with the wine. Customers are given suggested wine pairings to purchase and BYO, but since we don know the menu or the number of courses, it was difficult to pace how long the white was supposed to last and when the red should be opened. All I needed was the red should be opened about 2 courses from now. Additionally, the overall pricing seemed slightly steep for no alcohol included, but besides the meal you are also paying for the extremely intimate and personal environment - only 90 people max eat here a week. Overall, with my criticisms, I reaching. This was one of the coolest dining experiences Ie ever had. The awards are well deserved and this is a restaurant that any food connoisseur should visit. I look forward to returning!', Wow. Totally blown away by our meal here. Definitely a top meal in my life! The experience was very intimate and you definitely felt like you were a guest in Jake and Alexa's home. They have two separate seatings and each is in a different area (chef's counter vs. table). We chose the chef's counter and loved it. You could watch the chef at work. There were only 8 of us and Alexa learned everyone's name and we got to know the person next to us. Very cool experience.The menu is always changing, but we loved every dish. Our favorites were the salmon and the pork...just wow! And we LOVED that it was BYOB. Alexa gave everyone suggestions, but you could bring what you like. Another great part was that even though it was a 13 course tasting, Jake and Alexa kept everything moving and on time. We were out of there by 8 pm (seated at 5:45). We would definitely come back for a special occasion!, ***Third visit on 11/6/2015, and now both serving time and portion size are fixed. They are killing it right now.***I've had the opportunity to eat here within two weeks of opening at the communal table, and recently at the kitchen counter. My first visit was great but there were understandably some opening kinks. Most notably the meal was over 4 hours long, and the portion sizes were way to small. The food and services were impeccable, and thus I came back.After my recent experience, I can say with confidence this is the best restaurant in Chicago and will soon grace San Pellegrino's list of top 50 restaurants in the world. I honestly think they can even climb to the top spot, but there are first a couple things to still tweak. Service time was fixed, we got through 13 courses in right around 2 hours 15 minutes, which to me is perfect. Every dish was outstanding. The Skuna Bay Salmon, Axis Venison, and AG Wagyu were the 3 best things I've ever eaten. The whole progression was balanced. I loved the way the textures increased as well as the flavors. The uni was the best I've had, but not a huge uni fan. To go to the top there are things they need to work on. First of all, the portion sizes are still way to small. They are literally small bites and again I left so hungry I basically had to go home and eat a second dinner. Secondly, the weakest part of the menu was dessert. The kabosu bomb was a perfect palate cleanser. But the tamarind ice cream and banana bread combo while tastey, was boring and left me wanting more. I really like bold and sweet desserts and this didn't cut it. Bringing in a pastry chef and adding a couple more desserts would be insane! On my first visit there was a huge piece of foie, this time only shavings, so that's always a disappointment when I go to a super expensive tasting and don't get foie. Lastly, while service was excellent, it seemed a little too rehearsed instead of organic like my first visit. Doing two tastings a day, 4 days a week, I'd be the same, but its something noticeable that I think with little tweaks can get back on track. Incredible place, can't wait to see what happens in the future., 'The accolades are well deserved. Definitely among the best Chicago restaurants; the experience was comparable to Grace and Alinea. Highlights included a beautiful salmon on top of beer bread--a bread the chef baked from the lees of a friend homebrew--and a Wagyu course that has to rank among the best pieces of beef Ie ever eaten. Alexa provided great service throughout the evening.', I went there twice in a month. First time was impressive so we went their again with more people. We didn't really understand their byob so we didn't bring anything. Alexa was kind enough so she went back to her room and grab some left over wine for us. It was very good. Second time we went with extra bottle and leave some there. Hope this karma passes on. It's always fun to see Jake and his people working on the food and Alexa explaining things while he's doing. Their's connection between chef and patrons. The meal takes about 3 hours long. Every dish was creative and delicious. Everything and every flavor he put together is so miraculous. Will go back soon when their menus updated., '42 grams: the best dining experience Ie ever had. Having visited some of the best restaurants in Chicago, I can honestly say there is no dining experience that parallels that of Jake and Alexa, the restaurant proprietors.Fantastic, beautifully prepared food, with some of the finest and rarest ingredients in the world; paired with suggested wines and a playlist of great music; it was an experience Il truly never forget.Alexa was incredibly accommodating; answering any questions, tending to our needs, and eloquently describing each dish. Highlights from the meal were the pork belly, wagyu, and salmon courses; all perfectly executed and paired with creative blends of vegetables, grains, and sauce/broth accompaniments. Each course was a great balance of imagination and great cooking.To top it all off, you get the opportunity to watch a rising star chef cook and prepare your meal, while asking any questions you want. Nothing like pairing some take-away knowledge with world-class dining.I cannot recommend 42 grams more for special occasions or a night out on the town. It an experience you will never forget and so much more than a restaurant.', 'After three fantastic dining experiences at Sous Rising (the underground dining venue Chef Bickelhaupt operated out of his apartment before opening 42 Grams) I finally made it to 42 Grams. I had meant to make it here sooner (the restaurant has already been open a little over a year) and after my amazing meal the other day I am really regretting having missed some of the earlier menus. The space at 42 Grams is very tastefully decorated; they really did an amazing job beautifully renovating the space. Elegant, intimate and comfortable. I strongly recommend dining at the Chef Counter as it is a lot of fun viewing the kitchen working their magic and being able to ask questions of the chefs. I wish more places in Chicago had this kitchen counter concept as it really enhances the dining experience. 42 Grams is BYOB and the menu is approximately 13 courses; the first half of the savories pairing with white wine, the second half with red and concluding with three sweet courses. Generally with extended tasting menus a couple of courses really wow me, a few more are excellent and a few fair-to-good. What was really impressive at 42 Grams was course-after-course was a home run; probably 10 of the 13 courses were utterly fantastic. The meal started on a high note and somehow just kept getting better and better. The food is interesting (rare ingredients, flavor combinations, textures and at times playfulness), top notch quality (A5 Wagyu, caviar, foie etc.), virtually everything made fresh in house, perfectly cooked and presented as works of art. This is truly some of the very best cuisine in the United States right now. I also was pleasantly surprised with the portions; I had heard some people complain they left hungry, but as someone with a hearty appetite it was just the right amount of food; sure I could have eaten more, but I left very comfortable and happy. The food itself is modern, creative and very reminiscent of what was served at Sous Rising with one notable exception; at Sous Rising nearly every course seemed to combine sweet with savory (likely something Chef had carried over from his days as a sous at Schwa), but at 42 Grams the savories did not have dessert like components; I definitely liked this evolution of Chef cooking. Chef wife Alexa leads the front-of-the-house team and is very friendly and extremely efficient. The rest of the staff is quite personable and competent as well. Perhaps my only complaint of 42 Grams (and what keeps it from being among my very favorite all-around restaurants - despite the food quality certainly being of that caliber) is that the meal operates too efficiently. Our thirteen course meal was under two hours in length; while some may actually enjoy such fast paced dining, when I splurge over $200 a head for dinner I generally expect the meal to be the evening entertainment and am seeking a relaxing, lengthy meal. Since the meal is a communal experience, one cannot request to slow down the pace - even if you slow down the courses keep coming rapid fire and I definitely did feel it was a bit of a rushed experience. The only other possible negative (but an aspect I also respect) is 42 Gramsmy-way-or-the-highway attitude; nonrefundable pre-paid tickets in lieu of reservations, no substitution policy, no catering to allergies - even additional rules sent via e-mail a few days before your dinner such as how much wine you are permitted to bring and how early you are allowed to arrive. Since my wife often has to take business trips on very short notice this greatly deters her prospects of dining here as the risk of buying a ticket far in advance is significant (and 42 Grams is still often selling out most nights well in advance, so last minute availability is rare). On the one hand as a diner I feel that a restaurant should be more hospitable with their policies, but on the other hand as one who dines out frequently I have seen the other side of the coin - there are so many difficult and high maintenance customers, i.e. cancelling reservations last minutes (or worse, not even showing up), making crazy demands on the chef to accommodate questionable dietary restrictions etc., that part of me gets 42 Gramsperspective and has to respect that they are able to fill the house night in and night out in a neighborhood not known for haute cuisine and with high (but fair) prices. Nevertheless the good FAR outweighs the bad at 42 Grams and they are certainly deserving of all the accolades received during this past year (Two Michelin Stars, Rising Chef of the year in the Jean Banchet etc.). I definitely plan to dine here regularly going forward and Chicago is extremely fortunate to have this venue.', ***42 grams is one of the country's best restaurants (maybe even the best)***Northern California fine dining combines talented chefs with great local produce, but Chicago fine dining always feels a step ahead (the chefs are more creative and have a more unique approach to food). That is the case with Jake Bickelhaupt's 42 grams, which celebrates the ingredient like great California restaurants but also experiments with techniques and flavor combinations to present cuisine the guest could not have even imagined.The first course of this excellent tasting menu utilized traditional caviar service elements (potato, cream and a herb--chervil instead of chives) to create a caviar presentation that was classic and luxurious as well as modern and fun. Potato chips provided a nostalgic flavor as well as the perfect crunch to the creamy vichyssoise, which had a silkiness I have only experienced at Coi.The next course combined sea trout with an aromatic bacon dashi, savory kombu, pickled vegetables, and blood orange. Like many courses that followed, 42 grams leveraged Japanese ingredients to not only accent courses but to become a driving force behind them. What was amazing was how the chefs were able to bring out these ingredients' true flavors much more than top California restaurants. An amazing salad followed--fresh, crisp lettuce, brioche with a crunchy exterior and a slightly soft interior, a creamy element and a punch from horseradish, bursts of tartness from finger lime caviar, and natural sweetness from minced prawns.A Mexican inspired course followed--a ceviche-like presentation of yellowtail, avocado, tequila, jicama, and tostada. What I loved about it was how the Mexican flavors really came across with the spiciness and the tequila as well as an intense masa flavor. Having this course showed what Topolobampo should be but is not. While I do like that restaurant, it is not re-inventing Mexican flavors like what is being done here.Next came salmon that was moist yet still flaked very easily as well as showcased a crispy crust. The salmon sat on top of miso toast and was topped with a fragrant mushroom dashi. Meat courses followed like venison tartare with an oozing egg yolk and crunchy grains and a crispy veal sweetbread that was topped with grated frozen foie gras, which reconstituted itself into a creamy mousse as it melted.There was also porcelet loin that was very moist despite being lean. The porcelet was served with a brassica, which had the type of perfect texture and freshness that only a few restaurants in California like Saison can achieve. The brassica was coated very evenly with a butter sauce, which was rich and intense while also feeing surprisingly light.The other great meat course was Wagyu beef, which had a flavorful, crispy sear as well as a rich and melted center. The beef was served with an umeboshi sauce. My mom used to eat umeboshi a lot when I was a kid and its strong flavor always reminds me of growing up and this sauce was the perfect accent to the beef--a classic sweet sauce but also a tartness and lasting finish.Desserts were fun including a palate cleanser of refreshing green tea panna cotta that was well balanced by tart yuzu, a sweet, nutty and crispy sesame tuile and a white chocolate sphere filled with kabosu juice. What I loved about this bite was how what held the sphere in place (saffron honey) and the garnish it was topped with (bubblegum hyssop) added lasting sweet and fragrant notes. The main dessert was dulse gelato sitting on top of a rice porridge (both crispy and soft) and finished with a salty, sweet and intense miso caramel. The last course was coffee espuma--light and airy but also an intense coffee flavor that was bitter and sweet.Service was exceptional as Jake's wife Alexa (friendly and charismatic) presented each course with enthusiasm and knowledge. Prices are high, but the quality of ingredients and creativity cannot be beat and Jake and Alexa do everything they can to make the dining experience as memorable as possible.While expensive, 42 grams provides an experience you could only have in a handful of restaurants across the country. And even restaurants providing this right-in-the-kitchen approach such as minibar, Table 21, The Catbird Seat, Beast, or Atera do not deliver the flavors, quality and skill with preparing ingredients like you will experience at 42 grams. When you consider 42 grams' unique position among other restaurants, dining here is a relative bargain compared to other luxury experiences such as staying at a top hotel. A dinner at 42 grams is a must visit for anyone who loves and appreciates fine cuisine and all the talent, hard work and attention to detail it takes to serve food that is delicious, nostalgic and unlike anything you have had before.I believe metered street parking is available., 42 Grams is one of the best restaurants in the country right now. Jake is doing something different and daring, and dining with him is an adventure. One of the problems with Yelp can be the lack of consistency across raters. For example, I am fairly choosy when it comes to restaurants, particularly given the quality of food that I can prepare myself at home; other people give Chipotle 5 stars. One of the only low ratings for 42 Grams has to do with a personality conflict, and not with food. So, what can you make of all this?I would suggest that you seriously consider eating at 42 Grams if you're open to novel, exciting, and even daring culinary experiences. The experience will take you out of your comfort zone. Yes, Alexa may be too chatty for some. No, you may not leave feeling stuffed. Speaking personally, I hate communal dining. But that's the point - to move beyond your comfort zone. as well as beyond your preconceived ideas about fine dining, in order to experience something genuinely new and extraordinary. Dinner at 42 Grams has the potential to change the way in which you think about food., I'm going to save you a lot of reading of my fellow Yelpers' super long reviews: if you can afford to eat at a place like this, you need to try 42 Grams. The food and presentation are truly exceptional, the space and atmosphere are unlike any other comparable restaurant, and Jake and Alexa are fantastic hosts.Go if you can. That is all you need to know., Doesn't get much better than this. 13 courses of unique and great tasting food as well as an awesome atmosphere. Very personal experience where you know you are getting the food exactly as the chef intends because he is preparing it right in front of you. Was there for about two hours but didn't feel long at all because pacing was good and you could always be entertained by watching the chef at work.Thanks for the great night Jake and Alexa!!, 'Overall, I felt that 42 grams served the best food among all fine dining restaurants in Chicago. My boyfriend loved the salmon. Nothing was absolutely amazing, but everything was really good. At other fine dining restaurants, some dishes are wow and some are disappointing, but everything was generally good at 42 grams. Alexa seems a bit aggressive and comes on strong, but that was okay. Also, having one to two servers make things a bit slow.', Disappointing. Very rushed, for one thing. The food was very good, but not as good as I expected, given the high cost. I wish I'd brought sake instead of wines; I didn't think their wine pairing suggestions matched the food they were serving as well as they should have. Finally... and this was the clincher: the chef (Jake) totally told off the main server/assistant at one point. I mean, really laid into her in a condescending, extremely rude way, and we could all see and hear it. Totally inappropriate. You just don't treat people that way, especially in front of guests. Would definitely not recommend the place, and we won't be back., 'OMG. Just not sure it deserves the 5 stars. The reason is mainly the cost of the meal and the availability of seating which then limits me from visiting them on a weekly basis to enjoy stellar memories in my mouth.', 'Absolutely delicious.....the best meal so far for my 2015. From the taste, the presentation, the demonstration, to the atmosphere, everything was fantastic. I had a great time at the restaurant with my taste buds and stomach fully satisfied. Chef Jake has great taste and creativity in food. The meal was worth the price and the M stars. This will be my to go place if I come to Chicago again. :)', 'It was more of a 3.5 but whatevs.Easy online reservations...especially compared to other high end places. Its nice that you can buy a ticket online and pay ahead. Like most, its non refundable after you make the jump.The space is way up north on a very unassuming corner of Uptown. They allow you to come at 830P. Doors are locked before that. If you are sitting at the counter...the first to arrive get to choose their seats. We were the last, but we got the end...which is what I wanted. The space is very cozy and nice. It seats about 14 people total. While we were there, there was only 10 total guests.Ive done the high end communal before and I am not a fan. I didnt realize that EVERYONE (table and counter) eat together. Yes, it makes sense for the smallness of the space, but personally I dont like it. Its a personal preference. And if you want to have an intimate dinner with someone...this is not the best place because you are almost forced to talk to your neighbors. And to be honest, the conversation I felt always led to where have you ate? Do you like this as much as blah, blah, blah I am not a fan of the pretentious where have you ate at conversation. We obviously all love food if you are dropping $285 for a BYOB restaurant in Uptown...ok?The food was all pretty good, but nothing was really amazing, I do find myself comparing high end places with these up and coming restaurants and asking myself...was it worth it? Here, I liked it but it is pricey for the area, food, and experience...so I am not sure.Caviar pancake-good...menus looking interesting at the start from the first bite.Uni and brioche-good, but somewhat an odd combination. uni was good, but not fab-oSturgeon-delicious and the little crispy potato chips made the dishBrassia-The char on the greens was excellent and complimented the dish fantasticallyElk heart-meh. This dish was a miss for me. It didnt go well together with the egg, the heart, the berry, etc.Duck three ways-personal preference...I am over duck. This was ok in comparison to some of the other duck I have had. It was very average. Dont get me wrong...it wasnt bad, just not excellent.Wagyu- YES! Excellent...I just wish there was more of this! Perfectly cooked and some greens to cut the flavorWhite Chocolate ball with liquid-nothing special. Bread pudding was one of my favorite dishes of the night. This dessert was heavenly for me. Caramel and sweet with a great mix of cake base. YUMSolid coffee-meh...Im a huge coffee fan but this didnt really do anything for me. It was a cool concept just didnt hit any high notes for me.Overall, a good dinner. Alexa and Chef Jake were extremely nice. She went through a good detailed explanation of each dish. At the end, we were giving our menu...which reminded me of a cheaper version of Alinea style of menu.', Great food. Exotic taste.It's BYOB because they don't have alcohol license! Must BYOB, 'There is a lot of good going on at 42 grams, and I lucky enough to be able to talk about it.When you go to these high end restaurants, there are usually one or two traits that set them apart. For me, it was: Alexa dish description: instead of just saying what the ingredients were, she also told us why they were there and how theye integral to the dish composition. But the best part was how she told us to eat the dishes, i.e. youl want to get a bit of everything on the spoon and dip it in the foam or just take this in one bite. I have never experienced such detailed dining instruction like that before, and I truly appreciated it, especially since these aren huge portions (which is completely fine with me, by the way). In these settings, I typically want to minimize screwing up how I eat, and Alexa made sure I didn make any mistakes. Call me a pauper, but when drinking wine by the bottle, I much prefer myself or a fellow diner at the table to pour instead of a waiter/waitress stopping by every once in a while to do it. 42 gramsDIY wine service was perfect -- ice bucket, corkscrew and towel was exactly what I needed. No feeling like the waiter going to get all uppity if I pour the wine myself, and among those at our table we could decide who wanted more of what.Chef Jake runs a respectably organized kitchen -- perhaps the most organized Ie ever seen. While you can watch him and Trent prepare the dishes, the reality is theye understandably done most of the real prep during the day, so watching the kitchen is mainly dish assembly (which is an art with the dishes that 42 grams puts out), but in terms of culinary theater, there aren lots of knives flying around or fish filleting, for example.Now, onto the food. The high end ingredients matched the high end price. Lots of caviar on dishes, A5 wagyu, and some game meats (which aren cheap). If a $200+/person restaurant should have value for money, I say this place gets close.Let talk about caviar for a second. It was in two or three of the dishes. While I appreciated this greatly (I can sit down with a whole tin and spoon and eat caviar all day), I not sure its inclusion enhanced each dish (other than, of course, having caviar). In most cases, I took a bite with caviar, and I ended up enjoying the caviar and the dish separately. The lighter, white wine dishes (if you will), tended to be heavy on salt, making it challenging at times to pick up individual flavor profiles. Since these were the first dishes, it kicked the meal off in an okay -- but not amazing -- way.Fortunately, the bigger dishes like rabbit, the A5 wagyu, and jamon knocked it out of the park, so things got better as they moved along (which is good).My favorite dish, though, was the aloe vera/galangal dessert. Make no mistake, I loved the buttery A5 wagyu, but this dessert was the perfect combination of sweet, savory, saucy, and crunchy. When I think of my meal at 42 grams, I think of this dessert (and Alexa dish descriptions).Will I be back? Not right away. There are too many restaurants in Chicago with top tier status like 42 grams I need to try before I repeat a meal here. I liked my meal and enjoyed the experience a lot, but it wasn my favorite high end restaurant experience in Chicago. And I don want anybody to take that to mean this place is bad -- far from it. 42 grams has earned some great accolades in just a few short years, so they know what theye doing, but Chicago offers a lot of options in this space, and the competition is fierce. As a diner, I want to try them all, and if youe a diner who interested in experiencing Chicago top culinary skills, then you should try 42 grams, too.', 'This review is LONG overdue. In short, the best high end meal I have enjoyed in Chicago. Each course was memorable, service was amazing and it was worth every penny (approx $210 pp). Reservations Reservations can be booked online which also requires payment. When booking, you have the option of selecting the chef table (counter top seats where the magic happens) or communal table (lower seating with a slightly larger group). You will note the chef table seating and communal table times differ. Meaning you will enjoy your meal with 8-10 ppl tops! Very intimate.BYOBYou are provided sparkling or still water. All other beverages must be brought in. What distinguishes this place from other BYOB Michelin rated restaurants like it ----- is that about 48 hours before the meal, an email was sent with wine pairing recommendations for each course to be prepared during our dining experience. It was three of us, so we opted to each bring one bottle from the list and share. I also picked up the Allgash Curieux a/k/a beer (yes BEER) suggestion for dessert. Ultimately, this was more than we could ever drink especially when planning to drink beverages paired with each course. Meaning we offered our drinks to the five others dining at our sitting and they ending up doing the same. .... Our dining experience lasted about 2+ hours.LocationThe exterior of the building is less than flattering. There was no valet parking and no parking lot which is pretty on par with all the others too. What matters is the inside. Cute! Even the bathroom was cute --- and had I brought my phone during my visit, I would have taken a picture. 42 Grams is located near Demera Ethiopian Restaurant. ..... GPS brings you right too it and so will a taxi. Lol BackdropIf I recall correctly, the chef and his wife are the heart and soul of 42 Grams. Speaking of souls, I think the name selection is because a soul is 21 grams and times two - get it?! The chef is fond of Graham Elliott and prepared a course inspired by him and used plates from his restaurant to accompany the course tribute to GE. Dining at the chef counter allowed us to see each course being prepared and to ask questions in free form. I suspect the same could be done at the communal table but I think the counter is better suited for it. While many look at the price of this type of meal and attempt to weigh its value by the quantity/size, it does not consider this type of business is a true labor of love. The ingredients, creations and size makes this type of place unlikely to be a huge cash cow, especially when both husband and wife are it. That said, I doubt any chef in this type of setting does it strictly for the money. You have to dream about creations to succeed even at a hefty price point. Knowing this, leads me to appreciate the talent and gift all the more. In sum, if you can afford the price tag, it is a great place, particularly for a special occasion. Highly recommend it.', I would highly recommend eating at 42 grams; it is worth a trip to the city just to dine here. It is the best restaurant experience and best food I have ever had!Warm, intimate and welcoming... The husband and wife, chef and front of house duo, know your name and welcome you to their chefs table. It's like you're eating at the dinner table in their home!Price should not detour you from the splurge; I feel as if I under paid after the gratifying feeling I was left with. Too many complex and unique dishes to describe; however, the triple seared highest grade sake marinated wagyu was and is a lasting memory.I will come back anytime I am in Chicago. A third Michelin star is definitely on the horizon!, when you think about the top 5 memorable meals in your life, what do you think of? robuchon, cny dinner(s) with family, french laundry, pierre gagnaire in paris, a date with your facebook wife, etc... when you already have your top 5 then you encounter 42 grams, one of those VERY GOOD MEALS will be replaced. be prepared for that.. the set up is amazing. the chef and an assistant in the kitchen. the chef's wife is front of the house. and THAT IS IT. 2 people preparing 11 dishes each for 2 seatings of at least 8 people 5 nights a week. it's not le bernardin where there is a dance of servers around you at all times in a flurry of motion, its not per se where it's an orchestrated ceremony every time they set down a plate. 42 grams is uptown (where there is a ton of construction right now). past an unassuming door is a very elegant, homey, simple space where some of the more delicious food i've had recently is being created. it's byob - so we brought a saint laurent and 2 pinots for 4 people to share. in hind sight i would probably have brought a white to accompany the first few dishes (like they had suggested, but we're mostly red wine drinkers..) wine glasses were set up, glasses were poured, and at 6 pm, alexa started explaining the format of dinner, the story behind 42 grams, and then we were under way..refer to my pictures for the 10-11 items we had (i didnt get a picture of the final coffee).. the food evoked happiness, feelings of warmth and fuzziness, a desire to ask for seconds for each and every course, but also excitement of what is to come. the menu is shared at the end, to not distract you from the experience. the menu is very hard to read anyway - some of the ingredients i have never seen before. alexa does a great job curating though - you knew exactly what you were eating, where it came from, the story behind the ingredient, and why the dish is composed as such.yes, the food is exceptional. but perhaps what stood out even more was the people i shared it with. that we're all at an interesting point in our lives, but can come together to enjoy a delicious experience. and thank you 42 grams for making that happen, and making it memorable., 'great food good atmosphere. Will come back again', 'Dined here on our recent trip to Chicago last weekend. It was a special evening, a birthday celebration.I booked it waaaay out, about 5 weeks ahead, after doing my research on the best places in Chicago for a memorable dining experience.We arrived as instructed in our welcome email, early but not too early, appropriate wine clutched in hand ( although had not decanted our red, as suggested in the welcome email. Having had an amusing mental image of us clutching a decanter in the back of an Uber, wine sloshing about.)We very quickly realized that we were to be the only guests for the evening.... the only booking, which was a real surprise. I had assumed that reservations here were almost impossible to get. We do appreciate that they honoured our booking, and didn cancel on us. It would have been stressful/ impossible to find a similar quality experience at the last minute in Chicago.So, it was to be a very interesting dining experience, and it really was. We were shown to our seats at the counter, Alexa introduced us to Chef Jake, and his two young assistants.Alexa was very professional , personable and gracious. Each dish, and ingredient was carefully explained by her, and everything was really, really good.I won describe each course, as many here on Yelp have already done so; SO many luscious ingredients, carefully combined, exquisitely prepared, great use of texture, and absolutely beautiful presentation.The Lamb, Squab and A 5 Mizayaki Wagyu were all memorable and perfect, our favourites . The dessert was quite a generous serving, and fabulous.It was also very interesting to be up at the counter, watching the cooking and prep action, which was very focused and precise, in an impeccable kitchen.So as far as food goes, a very solid 5 stars, minus 1/2 maybe, because the byo wine thing is a bit of a pain in the bum. Much nicer to have a knowledgeable sommelier, and have the wine served, but this wasn a major downer for us. They don have a license, and we knew that going in.Why the 3 stars then?Well, all was delicious, interesting and great until the very final coffee course.....which is a small mousse/ luscious creation, with cardamom, served in espresso cups.Something went wrong . First attempt by the assistants didn work.There was a major chef melt down, right there in front of us....the two young assistants had their a$$e$ handed to them, dressed down in a really angry tirade, cups banged on the counter, mess, scolding. Then chef Jake made it himself. We were served and he vanished.Not to be seen again.Not a Happy Birthday, nice seeing you, hope you had a good meal from him . Nothing. We had no opportunity to thank him for the meal , or say goodnight. We were left feeling extremely awkward, and it definitely marred an otherwise special and delicious birthday meal.I thanked the young assistants across the counter for the great meal, and for their hard work.They smiled but looked miserable.Considering that we were the only guests, and it was a birthday, a very personal and intimate setting.......I think Chef Jake could have made an effort to keep it together. We had no interaction with him all evening, and a good end and send off would have been gracious and professional, and there would be another 5 star review here.Alexa continued to be very professional and end the meal on a good note for us, and see us on our way, with an autographed menu and recommendations for music venues nearby. She is a great asset to this establishment. Dining in this circumstance is a real spectator sport. All the prep, interactions, everything is laid bare to the view of the diner.It is theatre...and I think it should be like the Ballet, or Opera: If you forget your lines, or slip and fall, get up, pretend it didn happen, continue with a good presentation. You don storm off the stage and leave the audience shuffling. The show must go on.Instead we felt that we were treated to a Gordon Ramsey variety of spectacle, to end our meal. Not what we had in mind . No amount of perfect food can compensate for witnessing staff being berated, and abused, up close and personal. They made a mistake, from what we could see, a pretty small one, after an evening of perfect food, and really good work by them. No reason for the level of drama. This is not the E.R. It food, very good food, but keep it in perspective, stay gracious. Fortunately, we went on to a fantastic Blues club in the neighbourhood, and drank and listened to amazing music until 3am.( Highly recommended : Kingston Mines, a short ride from 42 Grams on the way back to downtown)', 'Been here before they got 2 Michelin stars. Best experience ever! If you want to have a great meal AND impress, this is it.', This was the best meal have had in Chicago in a couple of years. Been to most of the top restaurants in the area yet none have hit on all cylinders like 42 Grams did. From the first bite to the last Chef Jake's creativity was on display. Multiple times during the meal could only think about how soon could get back to eat there again.Service is great with Alexa working the front of the house. While it is communal seating if you end up at the chef's counter have a bit more of a separate feel to it.Will be dining there again shortly and hoping they can match the experience of the first time dining there!, 'Amazing experience done by 2 very kind, friendly, personable people. Chef Jake brilliant creativity shined thru each beautifully plated dish. Most commonly said on our side of the counter, wow. soooo good. how did he come up with that? We thoroughly enjoyed our delicious meal, and felt that the portions were perfectly done.'|2
1|acadia-chicago|Acadia is a good place to go if you are not hungry and wish to pay exorbitant prices for artistically arranged nibbles on a plate. For all of the other normal people in this world, stay away! One really has to wonder what they were thinking. This newly opened restuarant which intends to be upscale, chic and trendy sorely misses the spot. First, the modern decor with full length windows provides beautiful views of a vacant lot next door... very unappetizing. The decor, while no doubt expensive, is minimulistic bare and cold, except for the light carpet in the dining room. The pour of wine and drinks was measured ( thimble size) and the complimentary appetizer we were provided with on opening night literally was the size of an olive ( a small olive). This was a good preview into the remaining courses. The menu is exceptionally limited, with only a handful of first and second course offerings. Our waiter strongly encouraged a selection from both. We now know why, the number of words describing each was more than the number of ounces in the entire meal. I had the wild boar (Charcutie)with pate for the first course, the description of which sounded exceptionally appetizing. What appeared was actually a few thin petite slices of ham on a very large empty plate, except for drops of what I think was mustard at $14. Their featured and highly recommended Mahu beef tips second course was equally small, two tiny pieces of beef tips on a large plate with a tiny and I mean tiny potato that must have been made with a magnifying glass, price $28. Each of the other selections by my wife and dinner guests, Stripped Sea Bass and Deer Isle Shrimp was equally petite and disappointing, $27 and $26, respectively.Two positive notes, our waiter and the host were very curteous. Too bad I do not see this as a long time employment opportunity. Also, what little food served actually was quite tasty. But this could not overcome the fact that everyone, everyone walked away feeling as though we just had been the victim of a scam and just as hungry as when we walked in. For the first time in my life, I actually had to go home to eat dinner after dropping over $100 per person on a night out for dinner with friends on my wife's birthday, what a disappointment. One cannot imagine what the owners and investors were thinking in designing the menu, location and decor of this resturant. And while we sorely need good new restuants in the south loop with a growing population of professionals of all ages, Acadia sorely misses the mark., WOW! Amazing menu (difficult to select from the great options), perfectly executed cuisine, lovely dining room/bar and very good service. We were blown away. A park will be installed next door, so the views will be nice. Don't miss this world-class restaurant. The seafood was not only extremely fresh, but also perfectly cooked. The flavor combinations are incredible. Bravo!! We are so glad to have such a great place in the neighborhood., I've been so excited to try Acadia since I first hear about it. I live across the alley from the back of the restaurant, so I've been walking around it on dog walks throughout the whole construction phase, eagerly awaiting the opening.The inside is much larger than I imagined (I hope the kitchen isn't too cramped for all the cooks!). I love the decor and the feel. The chairs at the tables are nice and comfy too.Looking at the wine list I saw a wine from Slovenia and thought that was very interesting. The wine guy came by and I asked him how it was, and he raved about it. It was delicious! It was also one of the cheaper wines on the list (bonus!). We had the scallop and charcuterie appetizers, the sea bass and shrimp entrees, the pineapple and chocolate mousse desserts. Everything was outstanding. The staff was also very nice and knowledgeable about the menu (I think our server was Jason).For 3 drinks each and 3 courses each, it was $180. I think the portion sizes were just right, and I was definitely full at the end (without feeling sick!). Once the park outside is constructed, the view will be great.I'm glad to have a place like this right by my house. I wish it was a little bit cheaper though! I'm sure I'll be back frequently in the bar area at least for the wine, and then I'll spoil myself occasionally with the delicious food! Great job!, 'I thought that Next was going to be my favorite restaurant of 2011, and then along came Acadia at the eleventh hour. Not as hyped and reservations are easier to get (for now) but I promise you will leave feeling as though you are in a special club. This restaurant is sure to earn Michelin stars- make reservations now so you can tell people you liked them before they were cool. Acadia is the only restaurant in the city that comes close to Alinea in terms of all around experience (food, beverage, ambiance, service). Acadia is a slightly more accessible and definitely more affordable cousin. Ie dined there twice in the two weeks since it opened and both experiences were spot on. When you walk in the door you are warmly welcomed by front of house staff and given the option to enjoy a cocktail at the bar or go back to your table. I recommend starting with a cocktail. Michael Simon (formerly of Graham Elliott) offers a specialty craft cocktail list featuring his housemade sodas. Try the Aviator (featuring his lemon soda and creme du violet) for a refreshing pre-dinner drink. The milk punch is lovely if you are feeling seasonal. When you sit down at the table, I recommend that you lean on sommelier Jason to select wine to pair with your selections. The first time we visited he suggested a few choices by the glass and let us try the wines before committing to the glass. His wine list and palate is so good that during our second visit we gave him carte blanche to bring us whatever he saw fit for each course. Each person at our four top had a different entree and appetizer, and we each had a different pairing. Each of the eight wines were lovely on their own and paired perfectly with our meal. This review is getting long, so Il keep the food description brief. The menu offered foodie favorites like foie and charcuterie, and contemporary American staples so you can bring even the least foodie of friends. Everything is perfectly seasoned and portioned. The lobster pot pie is not to be missed. And the desserts are lovely! So many fine dining restaurants lose steam at dessert time, Acadia is an exception. Try the Chocolate Creameux (paired with the Rare Tea Company chocolate tea).When the bill comes you are in for a pleasant surprise. For a cocktail, two glasses of wine, an appetizer, entree and dessert, expect to spend just 100!Hope to see you there! I just made a reservation for my third visit.', First of all, I cannot wait to go back. I have been waiting for this to open and it blew me out of the water from start to finish. The hostess was very warm and friendly and took our coats immediately. The bar was spot on with a very passionate and knowledgable mixologist. The ambiance was warm, soothing, relaxing, and very elegant. I could not believe how comfortable the chairs were which is an added bonus. Everything we ate was equally delicious which never happens to me when I eat out. I could not decide which was better, then scallops, the risotto, the lobster, or the shrimp. The wine was great and the tea at the end of the meal was 1000% better than the tea I had out for high tea service at a nice hotel downtown. I don't know what the Robert guy was upset about because an amuse bouche is supposed to be one bite and its just to get your palate ready. The portions were good for me, I had 3 things and could have probably shared one more. When the food is that good its hard to decide what to order and I didn't want to stop eating. This evening was one of the best nights out I have had in a very long time and I cannot wait to return with my husband for a night of indulgence! I also plan on hanging out at the bar and having a glass of wine after work. Great job to the hostess, bar, waitstaff, and chefs! I once again am excited about food!, 'This is a review of Acadia New Year Eve dinner. We were at the early 6:00 seating, a party of 2, and the cost was $125 pp., including wine service.Il begin with the food:HIT: Maine Lobster Cappuccino truffle froth. Heaven in a cup. Luscious cream with one perfect piece of lobster. Truffly and delicious. Paired with a decent Champange that wasn listed on the menu, and we couldn get a good look at the label.SoSo: Farm Eggs, Creme Fraiche, Foraged Mushrooms, Perigord Truffles, paired with 2009 La Miranda De Sacastille Grenache Blanc. Basically, scrambled eggs, as our server helpfully pointed out!! Oddly, I tasted no truffle even though there were several slices in the dish. Wine was fine, but unmemorable. HIT: Scallop, White Chocolage, Ras El Hanout, Olive, Black Sesame, paired with Rare Wine Co., Boston Bual, Special Reserve Madeira. One perfect scallop with accoutrements, and the Madeira was a perfect match. Our favorite dish of the evening, I like an entree of this.EXTRA: not on menu, Buttered Biscuit with Fleur del Butter. Fine, but the biscuit was too warm and instantly melted the butter.MISS: Wagyu Beef, Mushroom Conserva, Pommes Puree and Confit, Herb Emulsion. Paired with 2009 Caves de Saumur Les Vigots Caberet Franc, Saumur. A total mess. The Pommes Puree were stone cold, the little potato crist was overfried to shoe leather and cold, the server went on and on about how the sauce was his favorite part but I had no more than a drop on my plate. Biggest problem was that the beef was so tough that I wound up with a big wad of gristle left in my mouth that I could only leave on the plate as inedible. If this beef was Wagyu the chef had better have a little talk with his purveyor. For me this entire dish just lacked any flavor or interest. Wine was dreck.HIT: Roelli Dumbarton Blue Cheddar, Shullsberg Wi, paired wth 2010 Chateau dgel, Minervois. Delicious cheese, just perectly ripe and the wine worked very well.EXTRA: Passionfruit semifremo with Hand of Buddah chip. Delicious, very tart and refreshing.MISS: Curry Pistachio Dacquoise, Rose, Champagne froth. paired with La Maison Cremant de Bourgonge Rouge Rose. Nice wine. Not mentioned on the menu was the white chocolate spirals, that added a bit of festivity, the cake, which was the basis of the entire dish,. was dry as dust.HIT: Mignardises. One perfect marshmallow, one perfect praline chocolate, and one perfect macaron.On to the service.HIT: Welcome. Perfect, greeted and once they knew our names we were addressed as such, coats taken, shown to table.MISS: Pacing of the meal. Oh boy, there were problems First we sat, and sat, and sat with nothing but Champagne which to their credit they refilled. Seated at six, the first course arrive at well after 6:30 and the second at 7:00. At this point wee thinking how are they going to get this all done before the second seating at 9? Well, the answer was that after about the third course everything started to arrive on top of each other, we no more be done with one course that the plates and glasses were whisked away and the next round was brought. At the end the bill arrived along with the Mignardises, with the clear expectation that we were not invited to linger, and when the server came to take the check it was accompanied with do you need a cab and do you have coats? No coffee service was offered but pretty much wee done now, time to leave. How much nicer to have said, If you like to linger wee serving coffee and after dinner drinks in the bar. When we left the chef was chatting up people in the bar, perhaps if he had been in the kitchen...SoSo: Service. Most was great, but there were some misses - glasses plopped down from the wrong side of the table, some of the silverware and glasses had smudges on them, the table got a little grubby and wasn cleaned, several times I felt like I was being talked down to as the servers overreached to describe dishes/wines to people they crearly thought were dining neophytes. MISS: attempt to upsell the alcohol. At a single service dinner with wine pairings leaving a wine list on the table is a blatant attempt to upsell and not appropriate.HIT: The room is very nice, and will be more so when the park opens. But, to call this stretch of Wabash barren would be a compliment. It GRIM.Overall, I really want this place to succeed, but there are some post-opening problems, and frankly I can see too many people in the neighborhood being able to afford meals here often, nor can I see people from outside the neighborhood feeling comfortable driving in.', 'Ate at recently opened Acadia just before New Year and also for the second seating on New Year Eve. First Il speak about our experience the Thursday before New Year Eve. My wife and have been living in the South Loop for about 6 years. We, as well as many of our friends in our building, have been waiting for an upscale fine dining restaurant option for the neighborhood. Well, we couldn have been more pleased with Acadia. High end food, perfectly executed, with on point service, but without the prices and stuffiness of other restaurants at this caliber. We dine often at other three and four star restaurants in the city, and have found Acadia to be more approachable with good value. My wife and I started Thursday night with a couple of cocktails. They were interesting, complex and reasonably priced. Heck an average martini around the city usually costs $14!! A nice relief to see drinks at $12 and a good selection of beer too(maybe next time). We were then seated in the dining room. The space was gorgeous, contemporary, but also comfortable. I had the charcuterie, which was some of the best Ie had in the city. Duck ham was genius! And my wife had the beet salad. She loved it, as it was a good new take on a beet salad that been done before. We then shared the risotto. Which was a healthy portion of diced potato, cream, leeks and truffles, which looked like and flavored like risotto. Clever and richly delicious! Our entrees really made us think that this is going to be a world class place one day. She had the lobster pie, which she claimed had the best lobster sauce she had ever had. And I had the striped bass, which was fresh and had elements of clam chowder. Again, whimsical and delicious. We finished our meal with the dessert that was basically fancy chocolate pudding. Great contrast in flavors and presentation. All in all a wonderful meal, with great value, ambiance and service. Wel be back often. A fine addition to the neighborhood. Especially with no other fine dining options when you want to go out and splurge a little!As for New Year Eve.... What a memorable remarkable night! The night started out a bit slow for the 9 p.m. seating. But once they were underway, the world class approach was back in order. They started with a lobster cappucino that was pure heaven. Silky and clean. Then the first course which was basically eggs, mushrooms and truffles. Simple and basic a bit. But the Perigord truffles added a nice touch. We love truffles on anything! Then our favorite course came next. A huge scallop with flavors of white chocolate and olive. Unexpected genius. The entree was the beef, that we noticed was from the regular menu. Very good buttery meat, with flavorful pureed potatoes and mushrooms. The cheese course was next and was a good choice. Cheddar with a touch of blue in it. Simple but appropriate. Then something that wel never forget happened. A huge eclectic jazz band marched out of the kitchen playing and dancing!! This all happened just before midnight and was perfect timing, since there seemed to be an electricity in the air. There must have been 20 performers and musicians! Each one of them in crazy outfits and costumes. They played a couple of songs, then did a countdown at midnight. At this moment, thousands of balloons were dropped onto the entire restaurant. People smiled and were maybe a bit in awe of what was taking place. I cannot think of a fine dining restaurant on New Year Eve that brought in the New Year quite like this. Really spectacular and a wonderful surprise. I can wait to see what they think of for next year!! The night ended with a sorbet that was tart and refreshing. Then a dessert that was only pretty good. It was creative and gorgeous. But I woulde liked an ice cream element of some kind to let the cake absorb. By this time though, my wife and I, wanted to just hang out, finish our champagne and relax. Overall one of the most memorable New Year wee had in quite some time. Fun, elegant, festive and delicious food. Those six oclock diners don know what they missed! Acadia is already one of our favorite restaurants in the city.', 'An excellent addition to the neighborhood! The food was fantastic with good portion sizes. It will be our go to place for special occasions.', 'Acadia made a birthday celebration a memorable experience from start to finish. The setting is striking in its calm elegance. The dining space is divided nicely to make the restaurant quieter and more intimate.The menu was appealing. We tried risotto, a beet salad, and scallops for first courses. All were presented beautifully and delicious. Main courses were also excellent. The Waygu beef was a tiny bit chewy, but the sea bass and lobster pie were perfect.Service was attentive and a nice balance of friendly and professional.Great to see another fine dining experience available in the south loop!', 'A bit hard to find right now as there is no signage, but definitely worth it once you do! Open at this writing for only about 2 weeks, Acadia brings a class act to the South Loop.First of all the ambiance is lovely. Everywhere you go, you are gently reminded that this is a beautiful restaurant. While I know the theme is supposed to be reminiscent of Maine, as the chef spent his childhood there- this tranquil space for me said elegance and class. The grey dining room with the upholstered white chairs, the silver beads dividing the space, the minimal art, and even the restroom are beautifully done. If I squinted and looked at one painting on the back wall or took more note of the twig sculptures, I might see Maine, but whatever you see know that it will be beautiful.Service was stellar. From the bartender up front who graciously remade my drink as I worked my way to find a vodka I liked (they carry a more boutique line of vodka) and that coupled with herbed olives made for a dirty martini that was not to my liking. But that was quickly rectified with a drink change for me from off of their cocktail menu. And like many places today- the ice is part of the artistry of the drink.Once seated, our server Hector and his partner Carlos- took excellent care of us- suggesting their favorites and helping out when a small taste of the most exquisite soup (butternut squash and coffee- odd combo but delicious) ended spilled in my friend purse (my friend fault not the restaurant!)The plates are artistry in themselves, arriving at the table with pomp and circumstance of broths poured or toasts placed. We started with three of the first courses to share. The potato risotto (delicious!) the fois gras (also a table favorite) and the chacuterie plate (would have liked more sliced meats rather than the pate type spreads but they were good). Our only wish here was that more toast had been placed on the table.The chef then surprised us with a plate of the tiniest little homemade biscuits you have ever seen! Served with sea salt and butter, I easily could have had another plate of these- that how good they were!For our entrees- we went with three of the most popular items- the shrimp and cuttle fish, the lobster pie, and the sea bass. All were good- but know to expect the unexpected as it will come plated differently than what you may expect which is just part of the beauty of this place. We had a little trouble with one of the lobsters as it still had the roe in it and had to be sent back, but it was perfect the second time out.There are only three desserts on the menu . . . .we tried two of them and again- the presentation is lovely but here they did not win me over on the flavor combinations. I thought my plain coconut sorbet was better than the two desserts we ordered.They have a private dining room which holds about 24 (the perfect place for a business dinner) and valet parking is available for $10 out front. Street parking is pretty easy in this neck of the woods too. As for the price? I thought it was reasonable . . . .about $300 for 4 people.So head to the South Loop and check this new addition out. You won find friendlier staff, more beautiful ambiance, or such artfully presented and delicious food anywhere nearby. Oh and that missing sign out front? I hear it on its way!', Inventive Drinks + Amazing Bar Menu= Sublime First TasteMy first trip out to Acadia was simply to the bar to check out the scene and try a cocktail, yesterday, Friday night. To my great surprise, my trip was also the first night of their bar food menu, what a treat! More on the food experience in a sec. First the decor is really pleasing; warm with clean lines and with neutral colors. The drinks were super! The bartender/mixologist is clearly passionate about his craft explaining the various drinks in detail in a knowledgeable, yet approachable manner. Watching the drinks being made is entertaining in itself; let's just say this is not a case of pour and mix only. Try the aviator, trust me! Then to the bar menu...literally a little something for everyone. I wish I had taken a picture to remember all of the offerings, but they included muscles, a burger, a cheese plate, and my choice for the night...a lobster roll!! Warm buttery toasted Traditional lobster roll bun, cold, decedent very generous hunks of lobster meat, with seasonings just right! It was served with homemade salt and vinegar potato chips. Yum! In addition to the main, even at the bar we were able to enjoy a complimentary amuse, a butternut squash veloute (soup) with a foam of coffee and lime zest which made me super excited for the food to come! We also were provided these tiny tastes of whoopee pie and pistachio crumble at the end of our meal. I know all the bar diners received the amuse, we may have received the dessert bites as a comp since our lobster roll took a little long to get to us...however the bartender seemed more concerned about the timing then we were, either way they were a very nice touch. To summarize, one of the nicest bar food and drink experiences I have had in a very long time! I can't wait to go back to try out the full menu and get a better look at the dining room!, What a wonderful addition to the South Loop! I decided to check out Acadia on the friday when they announced their new bar menu. I needed a drink after a hectic week. A friend and I arrived and even though we didn't have a reservation, the hostess happily sat us at a table in the front area near the bar. From that point on, even though we didn't plan to order a full dinner, we were treated as if we were the most important customers in the restaurant. The restaurant gets 5 stars for service alone.We were given an amuse-bouche, a pumpkin soup. That was followed by a tasty biscuit. Each of us ordered the lobster roll, which would match one found on the east coast. The lobster was cooked just right. My friend had a dessert that was beautifully presented.The drinks? Definitely worth a return. The restaurant's menu is pretty pricey but there was a good sized crowd in the main dining area. Can't wait to go back to try the lobster pie!, I stopped in for drinks last night, and was really impressed. Both of the cocktails that my friend and I ordered were interesting, and delicious. We followed those up with generous pours of red wine and the cheese plate. The cheeses were good, especially the goat cheese, and the waiter said that the chef has plans to make/acquire cheeses with more funk. That makes me very happy. The service was very formal, but all the staff had good sense of humor. I'll be back!, 'Now this place is one thing I will definitely miss about the South Loop after I soon move. I had been anticipating its opening for months and my husband and I checked it out last weekend. It was really a great experience all around. Il definitely return to the South Loop solely to go here.There is a cute bar area in the front that honestly large enough to be its own establishment. And the restaurant is larger than it seems from the outside. It big and open and somewhat airy, and there also a smaller room that looks like it could be used for private functions (love the lighting fixture in there, by the way). The main dining room is spacious enough so that youe not sitting on top of your fellow diners, which I appreciate. However, one thing that really bugged me (probably more so than it should have) was the lighting. It was basically like dim fluorescent lighting. Dim or not, fluorescent lighting is just gross. I wish it was softer. The dd9cor was nice, though. Very simple and the subtle nods to Acadia were well done - cute little rock vases on the table with some greenery in them and a small slate tray for each diner (made me think of Cadillac Mountain). I was really impressed with the food. Il admit it; I a pessimist when it comes to dining in the South Loop. Ie lived there for three years and let be honest, the dining options are really nothing to write home about. But alas, we have Acadia. We shared the risotto and pork belly to start. The risotto was good but I didn love it as it more of a play on risotto--made of Yukon potatoes so it not quite as light and creamy. The pork belly, however, may have been the best Ie ever had. Loved the inclusion of the pear and mustard seeds--really made the dish. I had the chicken presse for my main and my husband had the lobster pie. Ordinarily I shy away from chicken when dining out, but this sounded interesting and they had me at truffle bread pudding. It was delicious, not like any chicken Ie had before, and the truffle bread pudding... well I think the name says it all. My husband lobster pie--deconstructed--was also very good. And even though I am typically opposed, we got dessert and I wasn sorry. It was the chocolate creameux which was simple and delicious (although I coulde done without the huckleberries - I sure a nod to Acadia, again, but I didn think they brought anything to the dish). Loved the little lemon bits. The courses all came out at just the right time so we had a nice, leisurely dinner, though not painfully long.The service was good albeit a little slow at points. For example, we ordered drinks from the bar but it seemed to take forever to get them. They were worth the wait, but still, the place wasn that busy. All of the staff was very hospitable, though, and we were thanked by more than one person when we left; it honestly felt genuine.I really hope that the location isn to Acadia detriment. It a really wonderful restaurant but I just hope it can thrive where it is. Maybe with luck it will become one of those places people travel to simply because it there.', 'Wel be back.Beautiful environment. Genuine, warm greeting at the door by the GM, who is also the sommelier and who paid at least as much attention to us throughout the meal as did our server. Which brings me to the one small complaint we might have, so Il get that out of the way.Our server was reasonably pleasant, but had a slight edge and apathy that became more noticeable because everything else about the place was so warm. When my wife asked if the kitchen would make a 1/2 order of the vegetable entree as a starter (a simple request), the server for a moment looked at my wife as if she had ordered 1/2 of a human head. Not surprisingly, she came back quickly and reported that the chef would be delighted to prepare that (the vegetables, not the human head). The server also made too many stops between tables and trips which made the wait longer than it needed to be for some simple things. She also left some items off of our check (not comped, and subsequently corrected). All in all it just seemed like her head and heart were somewhere else.OK.All that aside, like the room the food was beautifully prepared and plated, and we found the portions to be perfectly sized. Amuse: lobster crisp with caviar - we wanted to order a whole plate of them.1st course: Wife: Aforementioned vegetable tagine. Ie always thought the word tagine sounds pretentious. I know, I know, it not, but I rather read braised. Anyway. It was delicious. Me: Foie gras. Deeeee-licious and a surprisingly generous portion.2nd course: Wife: Black cod. I found the accompaniments to be a little heavy but it was still good and she thought it fantastic, which I guess was more important. Me: Shrimp. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, slightly smoky. Be advised that some things may appear differently than you expect. For example, the chorizo with my shrimp came out as crumbled freeze-dried chorizo. Not what I expected but WTF, I strapped myself in and went for the ride. Small sacrifice.Dessert: no room at the ranch, but we checked out the menu and there were some good-lookinitems.Drinks: Several colorful items by the barkeep. I had a Sazerac which was a little heavy on the absinthe so of course I had to do the whole intense Parisian artiste in the late 19th/early 20th century routine but kept both of my ears intact. The wine list is really, really great with many unusual items from unexpected places like Slovenia. Wine prices were reasonable. Jason (GM/sommelier), as I said, was great.Bonus, our car was waiting for us outside and warmed up by the time we got out the door. A really nice touch which I suspect is easier to pull off in that neighborhood where traffic is light.OK, Ie now invested 10x more time typing this review than I should have. Back to my normally scheduled Sunday.Go to Acadia.', 'We visited Acadia on a blustery cold evening. Luckily, the interior was warm and inviting. We had the Pork Belly, and Sunchoke Veloute as firsts, and the Wagyu Tri-tip and Stonington Lobster Pie as seconds. The food was well prepared and tasty. The timing of the dishes was good, and all of the staff were friendly. We left completely satisfied.We will definitely be back to try out more dishes. There is a different bar menu, and I may just stop by to sample some of that.', 'The food at Acadia looked beautiful and tasted even better. My favorite dish of the night was the first course scallops. I ate things that I never thought I would try and licked my place clean.The atmosphere is modern and clean. It runs the risk of being a little blank but the people and the waitstaff kept the place feeling warm and fun.I recommend arriving early for your reservation and having a cocktail at the bar. They are a little strong but dinner is always more fun when buzzed.', 'Went last night for the first time. Sat at the bar...liked that menu better...good options for non-meat eater that do eat fish. Lobster roll and mussels were great. Excellent drinks and attentive/engaging service. Will go back regularly if they can keep it up!', 'Acadia is a great addition to the South Loop. The service (starting & ending with the valet) was fantastic. The cocktail menu had some interesting options and we were pleased with the ones we picked, no doubt the others are equally good. The first courses are appropriate for one person. I tried the Pork Belly and Sunchoke, both were enjoyable for respective reasons. For a main course I tried the Lobster Pie & Waygu Beef. I enjoyed the Lobster Pie the most and want to try the Chicken Presse next time. For desert the Passion Fruit Toffee was delicious and a perfect item to split. They also have a separate Bar Menu that has some attractive items to try soon. Given the selective menu I hope they change it regularly and promote it properly to keep folks coming back for dinner service.If you are in the area and want to have a great dinner, this is the best choice (or close to it) in the neighborhood .If you are in the South Loop and want great cocktails, this is the best. I would say it is on par with other top choices like the Violet Hour, Watershead, etc.', 'We had heard great things about Acadia: we were not disappointed. I must preface this by saying that that this type of restaurant is not really my favorite type. And, at risk of sounding like a boor, I would say that its type falls into the category of the more modernist, classical French-influenced, and with some trappings of molecular gastronomy, in the tradition of Tru, Alinea, and Moto to some extent: hyper-attentive service, austere-but-beautiful ambience, small but super-artistic and fantastically-creative dishes, and relatively narrow focus. I enjoy the experience of this type of restaurant, but sometimes seek a more simple food... That said, Acadia was a delight. It was everything that Tru aspires to be, but at a fraction of the price and without the sense of snobbery. Our server was really fantastic: both attentive and with a masterful knowledge of the menu. The food was delicious and beautifully prepared. The ambience was modern and formal but still warm and comfortable--very nicely done. We will certainly be back. My only hope is that they continue to cultivate and expand the bar menu (they have some tables in the bar area, outside of the more formal restaurant) so that we can come here more often for more of a neighborhood restaurant experience, with simpler food, in addition to those special nights for which the main restaurant would be reserved.', 'Awesome addition to the SLoop! Unexpected location for a restaurant but the space is beautiful inside. Entire staff was very warm and welcoming, from start to finish. Mixologist was super nice and made us deLICious cocktails. Loved that the bar was in the front and separated from the main part of the restaurant - a great place to meet someone for drinks. Elegant but simple, modern/sleek decor. Food was excellent, especially the scallops appetizer, the black cod (absolute heaven) and the deconstructed lobster pie. Only complaint was our white wine was not chilled enough, but that was VERY quickly rectified by the manager himself...good save from having a star removed. :) Will definitely be back!', I was extremely impressed with Acadia. In fact, I signed up on yelp for the sole reason of typing this review. With so many different amazing restaurants in the city of Chicago, it is becoming increasingly difficult to stand out. Acadia surpassed my expectations and then some with the elegant yet inviting atmosphere, outstanding staff, and of course the beautiful and delicious food.We dined at Acadia on a Saturday in the beginning of January and I wasn't sure what to expect. The reviews I read were very good, but I'm always a little bit leery when I read such positive comments about a new restaurant. I didn't want to be disappointed!Here is a rundown of what we ordered:1st CourseWe both had the bay scallops prepared with butternut squash, lime, and I forget what else. The plating of the dish was amazing and the scallops were seared perfectly. The acidity of the lime and sweetness of the squash balanced the dish very well.Main CourseWe ordered the shrimp with cuttlefish noodles and the deconstructed lobster pie. I didn't eat the shrimp but was told it was excellent. I ordered the lobster pie. As the dish arrived, the lobster was served with pearl onions, carrots, potatoes, and a homemade biscuit. This looked great in itself, but then the server poured a lobster bisque over the plate that definitely pushed the meal over the top. I couldn't wait to eat it and it was definitely one of the best lobster dishes I have had. I also thought the portions of the food were spot on. We were both full, but not overly to the point where you feel like you're going to burst.We didn't have room for dessert, but our server did bring us a small chocolate cookie and this root beer taffy that we both loved. In fact, the server brought us more of the taffy before we left after we commented to him how much we enjoyed it.The wine for the evening was something we went back and forth on. Jason, the sommelier/GM, was beyond helpful. He introduced himself and then went out of his way to help us with choosing a perfect wine based on our preference. The bottle was very reasonable as well.This brings me to the rest of service. Great food is always important, but we were both surprised at the attentiveness and overall great people that worked at Acadia. The hostess was very friendly and took our coats upon arrival. As we were leaving we talked to her for a few minutes about how great the restaurant was, and she called a cab to come pick us up. She even gave us two wrapped pieces of homemade bread for the following day!As we waited for the cab to arrive, we were introduced to the mixologist who heads the bar at the opening of the restaurant. He offered to make us a light after dinner drink and it was great, but a very nice gesture as well. Once again I was impressed by more of the staff.Last, but not least, our server was very knowledgeable of the menu. He was attentive, yet made sure to give us space while eating. After the meal, he opened up more and talked to us about where he was from, asked about us, and even talked football with me for a bit. My point is that even though Acadia is a higher end dining destination, the staff separates themselves from other restaurants by being open, friendly, and not full of the stuffy attitude that accompanies some of the other comparable restaurants.I highly recommend Acadia and can't wait to return, as it has become one of my favorite new spots in the city!, Worth the trip no matter where you are coming from!The BarMy wife and I arrived 15 minutes before the other couple we were dining with and decided to have a drink at the bar. Michael was the bartender and was great! He gave us a warm welcome, ran around the bar to pull us another chair so we had 2 (despite me going for the chair!), provided water immediately on sitting down, made great recommendations, and served great drinks! Good start!The RestaurantThe good experience continued! Our server was Charity and she was wonderful. She was very knowledgeable on the menu, made excellent suggestions, and was a very friendly person taboot! Jason was the sommelier who made excellent wine suggestions, was very friendly, and set a wonderful mood in the dining room!The FoodTo note, I'm a lover of food and all types of food but wouldn't call myself of foodie or fine dinner if you will. But some in our party were! And each and every one of us loved the food! Chef Ryan really puts his heart and soul into these means!! My #1 was the Lobster Roll w/sea salt & vinegar chips with the Risotto in a close 2nd. In total we ordered about 8 different items and love them all!In closing I'd call the restaurant classy yet comfy with delicious food and we'll be back!!! Well done!!, My boyfriend and I went on a double date with the bff and her fiance. As fellow sloopers, they had raved about how delicious and not yet overpriced their first dining experience was so I figured it was a good way to get the bf into the South Loop.First things first: the space is surprisingly large, I LOVE the minimalism and if Rachel Zoe ate food and not just gulps of air, she'd be into this place too. The liquor offerings are not your usual fare: Acadia uses local distilleries/distributors so most of the vodka I had never seen, but M Vodka was a little peppery and did just the trick. To be perfectly honest, I ate SOOO much that I actually felt sick after the meal. The bf and I split 3 first courses: the beets, the sunchoke veloute, and the charcuterie. The Sunchoke soup was my favorite, mostly because it was 2 parts heavy cream, 1 part butter and 1 part everything else. Rich and AMAZING. For mains, he went with the chicken main I chose the Waygu beef, both of which were outstanding. We had absolutely no room for dessert, but the lemon square and mini whoopie pies that came out with the check were TO DIE FOR, and hopefully next time I'll stick with one first course, one main, and leave room for dessert. Of Note: We sat down to eat at about 9 and didn't leave till 11:30. They are very conservative with the amount of time between courses, so don't expect to get in and out. We asked our waiter numerous questions about the menu and even got a tour of the kitchen and to meet Chef McCaskey. Our experience at acadia was to me, world class, and I highly recommend it., 'Fine dining at its best: amazing service, exceptional presentation, expensive, and delicious!From the moment you walk in the door at Acadia you know youe in good hands. The hostesses great you warmly and take your coats, they pull out your chairs, the waiter is friendly and chic. Everything is completely polished, from the stark beige, white decor to the little stone placeholders for your napkins, and they way the staff silently slips in and out secret doors from room to room. The waiters and bus boys are trained to perfection, water glasses are always filled, empty cocktails are whisked away promptly, and two to four waiters bring your food every time. You almost feel like youe in a modern episode of Downton Abbey. Once you order, the food experience begins. Portions are perfect, there not too much food, but it is hard to decide what to order as everything looks delicious. The first courses were amazing. The winner at our table of four was the charcuterie, a delicious array of meats! If you think chicken liver mousse is unseemly, you will quickly change your mind, as it tastes amazing. The entrees were good as well, my husband won again with the order of the deer isle shrimp (but wouldn let me taste it, apparently it was that good.) My chicken presse missed the mark, it was a little too fatty/salty for my taste, but the truffle bread pudding that accompanied it was fantastic. We went with drinks and cheese for dessert, which was excellent as well. A great selection of cheeses.Where Acadia really stands out though, are the amuse bouce and special treats that keep on coming. Palette cleansers, petite biscuits instead of the traditional bread basket, and the cutest plate of mini whoppie pies as an after dessert treat, the chef wanted you to have something sweet our waiter said. And the peace de resistance, youe handed little wrapped cookies when you pick up your coats and head home.Definitely go here if you want to feel austere, sip delicious cocktails, eat gourmet food, and have a wonderful evening.', Wow! I agree with all the stellar reviews of this place. I hadn't heard anything about this place and had no expectations and I was very impressed. The service was impeccable (although the waiter was a little difficult to understand) and the food was even better. The presentation throughout was perfect from all the little chef's treats in between courses to the sweet treat I was handed on my way out. Stop in early to visit with the friendly bartender. Don't miss this place!, 'The atmosphere is beautiful. The drinks innovative. And they were willing to creatively identify ways to make a vegan dish for each course. One of the most enjoyable meals I have had in Chicago.', Acadia is a welcome addition to the South Loop and five star experience in food, service, and decor. Amazing attention to detail. All dishes were delicately prepared and cooked to perfection. The complimentary amuse bouches were a great touch throughout the meal. Service was consistently outstanding and the hostess even had our coats ready when we were leaving (how did they know??). I can't wait for the spring menu!, 'My 600th review, so I wanted to make it a good one!Acadia (1639 S. Wabash) is a place of plenty. The name is a reference to the French settlement in the new world, modern day Maine, and the seafood-heavy menu reflects these coastal influences. Acadia offers the sort of fine dining experience you expect to find in the Gold Coast, but lucky for me (a South Loop resident), the restaurant Chef and Proprietor, Ryan McCaskey, is also a Slooper.You hear the term fine dining and you probably jump to the conclusion that the evening will be outrageously expensive. McCaskey has been sure to maintain the restaurant accessibility for the neighbors. Upon entering the space (note there is no signage to the restaurant, so your only guide will be the valet signage out front) you are greeted by the host stand and a minimalist white bar off to the right. There are a handful of seats for guests to enjoy a more relaxed evening with hand-crafted cocktails and a less expensive bar menu that includes a burger ($12), a lobster roll ($14), and a few other items all under the $16 mark.The dining room has a few different areas and can even be sourced for private dining. The walls are white and there are large rectangular windows that offer views to the north of area condos and the Willis Tower. There is not much to look at on the walls; the Chef wants you to notice his food. To relish in the dining experience. The chairs are comfortable; the tables are nicely spaced. Though the setting is modern you will feel at ease. The staff, though perfectly on par with their formal fine-dining service, is relaxed and friendly. The wine list is extensive and the sommelier is passionate about his selections. There are a variety of cocktails that are worth sampling; they could warrant a visit to Acadia bar all themselves.Bucking the Chicago dining trend, menu items at Acadia are meant to be enjoyed individually. Diners will start with an amuse bouche followed by their first course. The Risotto ($10) is an imaginative play on its namesake dish using tiny cubes of Yukon potato standing-in fo the grains of Arborio rice topped with hairs of black truffle. The Charcuterie Platter ($15) would be the one item that would easily be shareable and boasts some rich chicken liver mousse. Though bite size, the petite biscuits are buttery slices of heaven and the perfect separation between courses. The presentation of the entrees is stunning and a true work of art. The Stonington Lobster Pie ($34) is a deconstructed take on the traditional pot pie complete with a generous portion of lobster and colorful pearl onions. All of the entrd9e portions are substantial by fine dining standards. The Black Cod ($30) is nestled next to a delicate sprout leaf salad. The Deer Isle Shrimp ($26) flaunted large prawns resting atop milky white noodles.There are digestifs, dessert wines, French press coffee and a handful of desserts ($10) to round out the meal. A decadent chocolate and bite-sized whoopee pies were presented with the check. Upon collecting coats (sans the use of any coat check tokens or direction from the diners) a parting slice of almond cake was gifted; a small remembrance of the fine dining experience in our very own South Loop. The devil is in the details and the Acadia staff makes sure that every detail is looked after with care.', some positives with the food, but for 2 people who try to eat at almost every great restaurant in town, nothing to brag about. and i ALWAYS prefer food vs. service if i had to choose one, but the SERVICE IS AWFUL, from the moment we walked in until the moment we left. most likely a team being led by a complete jerk of a manager who could not care less about our needs or gentle complaints....his name is JUSTIN in case anybody has had a similar experience.so unfortunate, but i'm sure this will be rectified soon enough when enough people complain about what a complete uninterested snob he is. we will be certain to pass that information on to our friends in the chicago food scene. very disappointed., 'I struggled with this rating. I planned a large birthday dinner here, and the restaurant worked with me to create an impressive custom prix fixe menu with wine pairings. We had a fantastic meal that went generally between very good and truly amazing, with one black mark that hit me the wrong way. But I couldn escape the sticker shock we all experienced at the end of the meal, when a $75 prix fixe with $40 wine pairings turned into $190pp out the door.To the food:Our first course, the lobster cappucino was a wholly unique creation of the chef, and was absolutely one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life. The dish was a nice piece of lobster tail sitting in a rich thick frothy broth that had the silky texture of cappucino but was fully savory and provided the perfect cushion for the soft piece of lobster flesh it surrounded. They paired it with a sparkling white burgundy, and the pairing was also spectacular, the wine being slightly on the sweeter side on its own but turning bone dry in conjunction with the lobster cap.Our second course was a frisee salad with roasted beets and chevre, and was a dish I was looking forward to. Unfortunately it missed the mark for me. Obviously the rules of fine dining leave quite a bit of creative liberty to the chef, but for me, the baby beets the pieces of which that were barely larger than pea-sized left me lacking that visceral mouth feel of biting into the meaty flesh of a beet, and represented a significant creative break from what I was hoping for. The salad was also accompanied by some sort of dark crumbled component that I was unable to identify, but which tasted conspicuously like an oreo cookie and was a clumsily sweet addition to an otherwise savory dish, that also provided an unwelcome gritty texture.Our third course was another big winner, a pair of seared scallops seasoned with ras el hanout and white chocolate. The flavor was fantastic, with the chocolate being extremely subtle. The scallops were of course perfectly cooked. If I had to give any complaint about this dish, it would be that the plate itself was way too large, leaving it feeling a little empty with a ton of blank space. Also the pairing (described to me as a signature pairing by the restaurant), a madeira, went a little over my head and left me wondering why I should be sipping something so sweet with this dish.Our fourth course was a nice piece of wagyu, cooked in a method similar to sous vide and finished on the grill, with pommes two ways. It is always beautiful to cut into a piece of meat and see it cooked uniformly throughout, and this was no exception. The pairing was a nice french Minervois that stood up to the meat quite well.As stated previously, the food and the pairings went mostly between good and great, although in many restaurants they are quite generous with pours on wine pairings and here they were fairly stringent. One other thing of note: the service here was amazing. Everybody was extremely friendly and attentive, and even with a party of twelve of us, they managed to bring enough servers in such that they were able to serve everybody plate for each course at the exact same time. It may sound trivial, but the effect of all twelve plates being lowered onto a table simultaneously was VERY impressive.So anyway, I imagine if you come to dine here you will probably be very impressed and at least part of the experience will be truly transcendent. But be careful, because the price tag here can escalate very quickly, especially with a cocktail or two. But I am sure I will be back for more.', Not sure what to say that hasn't been said. One of the best dinners I have had in Chicago, hands down. We're both vegetarians, and there was enough for us to eat. They said to call ahead next time, and they will create additional vegetarian options for us. Those who have said service was bad were either at another restaurant or drunk. Service was top notch, all around. They took my wife's coat as we walked in, and then returned it as we left. They asked if we needed a cab or our car brought up. They were always refilling water glasses without ever seeming to be there.Best part was when the bill came, an amazing dinner for 2 (no alcohol)- $68.wow, Last night was fantastic. Everything from michael at the bar to the lobster pie. Wow. Lobster was cooked to perfection, I thought I was eating jello. That's how well it was prepared. Forget about wine, those cocktail were amazing and you know the bar took great pride in their preparation. New found love. Thanks acadia., We had the last seating on a week night and the service and food were excellent. We didn't feel rushed and the sommelier took the time to let us taste several wines, even though we were ordering by the glass. I had the lobster entrd9e and I still think about it from time to time. The lobster was perfectly cooked, tender and flavorful; the sauce was a bit too rich for me. My husband had an incredible pork belly appetizer. I'd definitely go back to, order a couple bottles, relax and enjoy my meal with friends and family. It is clear that chef-owner Ryan McCaskey cares about both the kitchen and the front of the house., This review is for the bar area only, and really, the lobster rolls and cocktails only. We took TOC's suggestion and popped in a for a quick snack before heading out for the evening. The space is lovely, lofted and modern, with an all-white decor. Luckily, the food provided the color. We ordered from the separate bar menu that included the lobster rolls, charcuterie, a cheese plate, a burger and salt and vinegar chips. The rolls were fantastic. All big, chunky pieces of lobster in a creamy sauce nestled inside a light and crispy bun (which was imported from from Maine, we were assured). The portion is not huge so order a few other things if you want to leave full. The rolls came with a handful of the salt and vinegar chips. They are delicious, leaps and bounds above Lays and even the fancy Kettle Chips. I wanted a bag to take home. We also tried a few drinks, which are $12 across the board. Honestly, the Rum & Kola Smash was a bit much for me. I guess I thought it would be sweeter based on the name but it was pretty bitter and too strong. Rick's Aviator was much more my speed. Light and refreshing, which is saying a lot since I'm not a huge fan of gin. All told, we dropped about $57 plus tip on not a lot of food or drink. But, the rolls are great, the space is inviting and the service is impeccable., 'We took a trip down to the 1600 block of Wabash to check out the latest from chef Ryan McCaskey - something I refer to as casual fine dining. I enjoyed the journey and discovery of an unassuming stand alone building seemingly out of nowhere in the South Loop. You can quite tell it a restaurant because the only part visible from the street is the bar area and the windows are frosted and discrete. Once inside you get to see and experience the beautifully done interior with strong elements of L20 and even Alinea (super high ceilings, metal bead wall and dark wood and white leather everywhere). I particularly appreciate the spacing of the tables (a simple aspect but so many places pack it in) and the soft cream colored carpet vs. hard floor. The wonderful design flows with and into the service - which is as good as any other five star restaurant in the city (likely the result of Christopher Gerber influence - he opened front of house at Alinea et. al.). Additionally, the menu is nice and easy to follow (with strong midwest, farm to table aspects and no pronunciation guide needed). There are two sections, one for each course. I sure you could get creative and order in any which way, but the message is clear - this is a multi course meal and everyone chooses two of them. And even though most people don bring cameras to the table like we bloggers, the food is gorgeous with its presentation and worthy of a few shots. I a little upset that we didn try any cocktails because I now find out they are a highlight (and a TOC Eat Out Award Nominee). But why call it casual fine dining? Because you don get the sense that you have to whisper to talk, or that you must put on your class A suit, and most of all you don need to bring five credit cards to pay for the meal. They do a wonderful job of providing a five-star experience without the five-start pretentiousness or price tag. The last piece of the puzzle is the food on the plate, and we enjoyed a lot of what we ate. I am disappointed in the main course selections the most, and that is the main reason our experience wasn as good as possible. I tried the Deer Isle Shrimp (served with cauliflower, cuttlefish noodles, chorizo, marcona almond, fried spoon bread) and while all the pieces were fascniating and creative, the flavor of the lemon juice and sweet thai chili was too strong to enjoy the entire plate. Erica ordered the highly anticipated waygu beef and it came out luke warm without meaningful flavor (not to mention there was a peculiar long break in the meal before our main course arrived). But even with disappointing dishes, the creativity, precision and beauty are very much apparent and respected.', Food was great, but it was the entire experience that gets the five stars. Acadia was fantastic - we weren't rushed, we were visited by the sommelier, the waitstaff was amazing. On top of that, the restaurant is beautiful, the decor is warm, and Acadia pulls all of this off without being pretentious.We look forward to returning...bar menu trip next!, My friend and I went to Acadia on Wednesday after accidently finding a reservation available on Open Table. I used to live in the South Loop, just one block away from this little gem, and I'm so disappointed that it wasn't there when I lived in the loop! I loved the decor. While waiting for my friend to arrive I had one of the mexacal cocktails and loved the unique flavor. Once she arrived we were seated at a great corner table. As the crowd got larger in the restaurant it did get hard to hear at times. However, I never felt like I was overhearing anyone else's conversation either. The service was excellent. The staff knew us by name and even had our cars waiting for us once we started to leave! In terms of the food, I was very pleased with my dish. I had the scallop appetizer and the lobster pie for dinner. The lobster pie was out of this world! It was a great experience and a welcome addition to the south loop. Bravo!, Great fine dining cuisine at approachable prices. It's definitely expensive, but you still feel like you get a good value. I had the foie gras and lobster pie. Hubby had the scallop app and sea bass entree. Mine was delicious. He said it was the best fish he'd ever had! The service was outstanding. Special occasion kind of place, but very happy to have it in the neighborhood! I can't wait to go back when I'm not pregnant, so I can sample the drink menu!, 'Wanted to try this new place while I was in town. Food was good to very good, service was meh - bartender was a loser! They have specialty drinks, and according to the manager (since we finally complained about how long our drinks were taking) - each specialty drink takes 8-10 minutes to prepare. So, our vodka over ice took 15 minutes to get to us. Stop chipping the block ice and get an ice maker... and hire an extra bartender! We would have drank more and left feeling much better than we did. Nice little touches - walking us to the restroom, introducing yourself, walking us out to the cab and a little sweet when we left... but get the basics down first! PLEASE!', This is the worst expensive restaurant in Chicago and EVER!!!The food has NO FLAVOR, literally, it does not taste like anything, you dont even taste the main ingredient! We ordered a few different dishes to try and they all tasted about the same and like nothing we know. Foie gras did not have any goose liver in it, guarantee you that. The ambiance is very simple - would have been ok cause we go for the food, not the look. However, since the food was not worth mentioning, we had to look outside on a vacant lot and prostitutes with pimps on the street. Service was decent, but no one asked if we liked the food (cause we would have said 'NO'). So, if you have money to waste - this is the place for you, good luck!, 'One of the best meals Ie had in quite some time.I dined at Acadia last night with my parents to celebrate a birthday. Service, from entry to exit, was impeccable - attentive, unobtrusive, polite, and synchronized.As for the food, we ordered 3 1st courses: charcuterie, pork belly, and risotto. The presentation of all (as well as the rest of the dishes in our meal) was very clean as well as interesting. The charcuterie was great, the pork belly phenomenal (I like to know where you get pork belly with so much meat on it, please!), and the risotto was tasty (albeit a little salty; I think the truffle might have had something to do with this).Onto the main courses: swan creek duck, wild sturgeon, deer isle shrimp. The duck - it tough to describe how my mouth felt about this dish; lets just say it was the best duck Ie ever had, and I almost didn want to swallow because it just felt so good in my mouth. Order it.The shrimp was also very, very good; cuttlefish noodles and squid ink added a lot of character, as well as gave a nice, sea-essence to the dish (but not fishy). I only sampled a little bit of the sturgeon, but what I had tasted very good.For dessert, we ordered what I believe was called a sweet cake, which was also marvelous. I like to note that we were served mini-course, almost like an interlude, between each part of the meal - a very nice touch. They were a small bit of soup, buttermilk biscuits, tiny cookies & tarts, and a polenta cake (which I just ate) on our way out.Overall, an A+ experience and I hope to dine again soon! Highly recommended.', I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars...we went to Acadia last night for dinner with another couple, and all of us had a fantastic experience. To start, you MUST get a cocktail at this place. The bartenders took extra care on each of our drinks, which were all delicious and very unique. You have to wait longer to get your drinks because the bartenders are extremely precise in putting together all of the ingredients. I wasn't sure what type of drink I wanted, so I described the type of cocktail I like, and the bartender made me the perfect concoction!For appetizers, we had the scallop dish, charcuterie and risotto. Since I don't eat meat, I only had the scallops and risotto, and those were both spot-on in terms of flavor. I think the risotto was my favorite of the two I tried.For dinner, I had the deer isle shrimp, and others at the table had the sturgeon, the duck and the lobster pie. We tried each others' entrees, and the best of the 3 seafood dishes was the sturgeon (fantastic), although my shrimp was fabulous. The one and only food disappointment was that my friend's lobster seemed slightly under-cooked (and, to clarify, I'm not one of those people who like their seafood cooked to death).Service and atmosphere were both perfect, and our waiter was kind enough to bring us into the kitchen to check it out and to meet the chef. With cocktails, a bottle of wine (+2 additional glasses of wine), 3 appetizers and 4 entrees, I think that both couples ended up paying about $150 each. Not inexpensive, but totally worth it for the quality of everything we had. Acadia is now on of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, and I can't wait to go back., I went with a group on a thursday night for drinks after having wanted to try this place out for a long time. I can only comment on the atmosphere. A few people did eat and the food looked great but the atmosphere was lacking any individual character. I felt like I was in the 'nice' restaurant at a good 4 star hotel. Think lobby hotel at the Westin. Nice enough and you know what to expect, just not a place you will be drawn back to.Pro: Interesting drink menu - very creative. Did not try food but it looks great.just ok: Atmosphere and food prices. Looks good but a bit steep.All-in-all, i hope this place does well and I will make sure to try it again to see if I see it in a different light the next time., 'Don get me wrong, the food is excellent, but if I was judging by the food alone, I would probably only give this place four stars. Four stars isn a bad rating, especially at a place like this (I comparing this to the other top restaurants in Chicago and I much stricter for this class of restaurants). In summary, the food was excellent, creative, and presented flawlessly. The only criticism is that when I left my mouth wasn buzzing with the residual interplay of flavors that some of the other top restaurants can achieve (see other places in my list). I know it kind of picky, but if a place is charging this much, then they deserve to be picked.The food is centered around an interesting theme: rustic, new world, French - read North American French colonial France. Appetizers: we had the Risotto and Charcuterie (a plate of pates and hams with condiments). The Risotto was probably the superior dish: it blended a rich, salty (but not too much) savory delicateness with a bold al dente texture. Very well done. The Charcuterie was interesting with perhaps the best item being the wild boar pate with whole grain mustard, although the duck ham was quite good.Bread Course: I loved the minibiscuit, and sea salt and butter is an amazing combination (gee, who have thought that carbs, fat, and salt go so nicely together...).Entrees: The pressed Chicken was good, but a little on the gamey side. I suppose that to be expected when you press a thigh and a breast into the volume that just a breast would occupy. My wagyu beef was stellar, cooked perfectly medium rare and garnished beautifully. Specifically, the herb puree was an amazing touch.Desserts: the chocolate dessert was good but a bit of a mess. However, that doesn matter much when the plate is clean by the end. The passionfruit toffee was just a 10, a masterful mix of sweet, salt, and richness. Il remember that one for a while.Ambience: Ie probably enjoyed the decour here more than at any other place: a really chic minimalist style with high ceilings and subdued colors. The only odd thing was the music, for a while they were playing this crappy indie rock that did not match the feel of the place at all. However, after a while they started playing some smoother, minimalist techno dub type stuff, which was more apt. So what gave this place the extra star? The service. Not only were they graciously accommodating for any request we had, but they inferred your desires so that everything was just perfect. For example, it was my wife birthday, and we wanted different desserts; however, in the opposite way of what you think. I was advocating for one that I knew she like while she was pushing another that she knew I like; in other words, a selfless impasse. We ended up ordering one, and we said are you sure you don want x, when we ordered. Sensing our uncertainty, the waiter brought out both, comping the second dessert. That class. They also accommodated our table moving a few times and actually took on a burden to find us a private, out-of-the-way table. Also they were secretive about serving the prosecco for my wife birthday that I arranged, and sprung it on us as a gentle surprise to her. I usually don gush over service, but the staff here could run a clinic on hospitality, from the hostesses to the bus boys.', This place is amazing.1. Service- Everyone was knowledgeable about the menu- the waiter and the busboy. I could tell that the staff are well trained because the service was perfect. From the moment you walk in you receive a warm greeting. I never felt like I needed to find my waiter. The staff make you feel welcome. 2. Food- We started with an amuse-bouche (cream cauliflower and dill). Great way to start the meal. Next the first course the risotto was excellent. From the first bite, my mouth was bursting with flavor. I could have eaten another bowl. The dish was not heavy, it was very light. Then another amuse-bouche (flaky biscuit with homemade butter and sea salt) The biscuit was a perfect way to lead into the second course. Next course- Lobster Pie. It was a deconstructed lobster bisque. Huge pieces of lobster with carrots, deep fried potatoes, onions and a sourdough pastry. The server pours the lobster bisque sauce over the dish table side. For dessert I had the spice cake-carrot sorbet, cream, pineapple and dried fruit. It sounds simple but it was so good. Finally, the finish to the meal, as if I wasn't already in food heaven we had a final dessert- caramel eclairs and chocolate whoopie pies. This was an experience that I will never forget. The food and service were worth every penny. I can't wait to go back!This is a gem in the south loop!, 'It 2012. I have been dining out in Chicago since 1997. I honestly can remember the last time I had such an amazing dinner. Sure, the company was good. My dress was good and my chest was perky (long story, but I had had some difficulty deciding how to approach the bra situation prior to dinner, being forty and all). I had scored a table in the bar for eight of us, the sitter was booked, life was certainly good even before I arrived at the place.Upon entering the front door, we were greeted by a very friendly 20-something, who immediately complimented my new dress (yes, my chest is still defying gravity). She took our coats and escorted us a few feet to an open, inviting bar area. The bartender (if you want to call him that - more like sommelier) invited me to try a Northern Italian wine I had selected. My husband ordered a whiskey cocktail and the sommelier proceeded to wow us with his mad mixology skills. I was of course admiring his skills, but his appearance was quite satisfactory as well :). Okay, sorry. Minor diversion. We proceeded to sit down at our festive table for eight, right in the bar area. And this is where I subtract a star for an otherwise perfect evening. I had called ahead and left three messages to make a reservation (beginning a week before our evening out). Even though I begged to dine there and let them know I was bringing a good-sized, local party, no one called me back. It was only after the third message when I received a call from a nice gentleman who said all he could offer was a table in the bar. I was a bit disappointed not to dine in the beautiful dining room, but oh well... things happen and Il overlook it, as the food is to die for.Great things about the food: Lots of variety while keeping it fresh and local. Hearty tastes and correct portions allowing for tasting many different dishes. Interesting flavor combinations. Beautiful presentations.Il end by saying the service was outstanding. We had a fun waitress who brought us both a shot of whiskey, after I calmly told her I was Irish/Scottish and I could drink anyone under the table. Why did I say this? I have no idea, but I ended up paying for it (literally - ha ha). Acadia is casually elegant, welcoming, and exquisite in its standards for quality. In a time when many restaurants are opening in Chicago (a good thing), Acadia is a standout. Take your time and allot three hours to enjoy this gem.', 'Acadia is new and they have worked diligently on the overall experience for the customer. The food is local (when possible), seasonal, uniquely prepared and plated beautifully. I have food restrictions and the server accommodated me to ensure I had a healthy meal. The beet salad was a delicate mix of sweet and savory. The pork belly was crispy and melted in your mouth, with a sophisticated addition of creamy caraway pudding. The duck was tender and perfectly cooked. My husband had Deer Isle shrimp, cuttlefish noodles (like glass noodles) served with a black ink sauce that was pretty and delicious. Thanks to Jason, the Sommelier, we did 1/2 glass wine pairings to optimize our dining experience. We were impressed with the international wine selections and the knowledge Jason has regarding each varietal. The decor is minimal and earthy, yet quite lovely. The food is the star of the evening. The service was well orchestrated, with food arriving by professional, friendly staff. If you are in Chicago, take a step off the restaurant grid and dine at this neighborly, sophisticated, comfortable restaurant.', 'My review is based on our cocktails only. We walk in and the inside is beautiful, in a hotel / movie kind of way. Nothing that was mesmerizing. Its very quiet. I have 2 beefs and 2 beefs only. 1 -No garbage cans in the actual toilet stalls / clothes hamper outside for garbage can.I do not like carrying my personal garbage out of the bathroom only to lay it in a very shallow wicker hamper. Its gross and weird. 2 -Drinks weren that amazing. - actually kind of awful but the bartender was amazing! I get it you have the special shakers, mixers, ice cubes, weird straws, original bitters, WHATEVER the whole spiel to make you original but it just wasn on point. There was nothing that made me scream OMG thats the best drink I ever had and for $12 it better be. Tony had the Mezcal Old Fashioned... which was super smokey and it had an old taste to it. Kind of like you reached as far back into your parents liquor cabinet and grabbed some old gasoline, dusted it off and poored it on ice. Tony loves Old Fashions but did not like theirs. The bartender was kind enough to give him something else. I had the Amnesiac aka NyQuil. I gave it a try - but neither Tony nor myself could finish it. Its probably not fair that I am a big fan of the Violet Hour. V.H just nails it where as this place doesn. Their potato chips are amazing. As were the two bites of burger we had courtesy of some awesome ladies who made our night!', 'Very pleased to have a restaurant of this caliber in the neighborhood, long overdue. From the moment we arrived till the moment we left each staff member we encountered was extremely personable, friendly and helpful. Was very impressed with the unique tiny personal touches Acadia did, for instance when we were leaving we were given a little sachet bag with an oatmeal cookie and a hand written thank you note attached to it. To me small attentions to details are what I like and remember the most and also keeps a restaurant apart from being just another typical dinning experience. Highly recommend Acadia...from the service, to the food, to the ambiance all was Perfection!I checked the outdoor seating because I was told by management or possibly he was the owner, that they will have outdoor dining this summer. He also stated that the park the city plans to finish next to them will have a small outdoor music shell for bands, which I think would be great on one of our long lazy summer nights!', 'What a wonderful addition to the South Loop! Not only is the food delectable and beautifully presented, but the cocktails are creative and equally tasty. My husband and I have been twice and experienced impeccable service both times. The staff is personable and eager to offer suggestions which do not disappoint. On our last visit, I had the lobster pie and was blown away! Acadia is a perfect choice for special occasions or to impress someone. Looking forward to trying their bar menu -', 'We arrived early on a Friday and the crowd was sparse, but it heated up over the 4(!) hours we lounged at a corner table in the bar. What a great way to end the work week!Service, as everyone has attested, was excellent. They were accommodating when I arrived, pushing tables together to accommodate our party. We put our waiter, Carlos, through the ringer grilling him on the menu/drinks we had seen online. He was knowledgeable about the menu and went directly to the bartender (Michael Simon was in the house!!) when he wasn sure about something. Drinks were delicious, we basically tried everything on the menu and can vouch for all of them. I enjoyed my frothy Aviator and slowly sipped my Vesper (gin AND vodka, oh my!)You are able to order off either the bar menu or the dinner menu in the bar area, so we tried both. They had just switched to the spring menu which is slightly different from what is online, so Il try to do this from memory. Here the rundown in order of deliciousness:-halibut with cod brandade - this was fantastic. I was disappointed the scallops didn make the spring menu, but the halibut totally made up for it. It was perfectly flaky and the cod mixture was super fresh and not at all fishy tasting. On top of that, the presentation was gorgeous. I can recommend this enough.-chocolate hazelnut crd2me for dessert - wow, this is heavenly. Usually I rather fill up on small plates than save room for dessert, but this was creamy and rich and totally worth it.-truffle risotto - in quotes because it actually made from riced yukon potatoes. The texture was unique but was still deliciously creamy. I can see why this is a favorite on the permanent menu.-kennebec housemade salt & vinegar chips - why would you order a small bowl of chips for $4? Because theye good. Actually, we ordered a second bowl. Enough said.-pork belly - this was a disappointment. My friend liked it, but I thought it was overcooked. It was surprisingly lean for pork belly, but maybe that was the problem. Il take 1/2 star off just because there so much good pork belly out there, so I guess my review is 4.5.I did not try the lobster roll, but it was reportedly as delicious as it looked.There are so many things I like to come back and try: the foie, the duck, the chilled pea soup, the beet salad. Needless to say, Il be back!', I so wanted to love you Acadia....Entering, I definitely understood what others were saying about the atmosphere - seems like it should be stuffy, but it feels more casual. There were people there dressed up and casual, so it did feel relatively relaxing. It is somewhat forgettable, though...nothing really stands out from an atmosphere perspective - is this so that the food shines? I don't know, but it didn't make me want to run right back.Service was really wonderful. There was an unfortunate incident with a hair on the plate, which was quickly whisked away and the staff compensated us with other goodies and were really great about it. The item in question was the peeky toe crab appetizer...which was unremarkable. So sad because it looked really pretty!The charcuterie was delicious and well presented. The lobster roll was quite wonderful - though you have to sit in the bar to eat it...I highly recommend it, though.I think we had pork for an entree..hmm...typically I remember these things, so that probably isn't a good sign. Whatever it was was good, but nothing memorable. Dessert was where we were spoiled due to the incident mentioned above. The banana bread one was good, though I thought the presentation looked a bit odd. The other was a poppy seed cake as the main 'part' of the dish. This one was good and refreshing.This spot is expensive, but not overly so. You can either go in and spend a ton, or do pretty well price-wise. However, the bar menu is a bit different, so I think if you are looking to eat here and don't want to spend a ton (well, not AS much), you can sit in the bar area.In any case, I was somewhat disappointed as nothing really stood out as the most wonderful dish that everyone is raving about. The food was good, well presented and fresh, but nothing was stellar (wait, those little cakes they give you to take home with you...THOSE are stellar...). I have to give food a 4 if I put everything together...definitely the lobster roll was the best part of my meal.Atmosphere...somewhat boring...I have to go with a 3.Service was very good - a definite 5.Value...about a 3 or maybe 3.5.Bathrooms...they were nice...and clean. A 4. So, if you are in the neighborhood, definitely a must visit, but what's going to get me back is that lobster roll...., 'This restaurant is opened in December 2011. It was a very modern style interior with high ceiling and wide space between seats so you can feel more private time.The food was the amazing contemporary French cuisine. Beautiful presentation using Midwestern veggies. The service was great as well.Only one reason why I could not give five stars was about drink. There are several signature cocktails. We ordered two of them, but both of them were just too strong and not tasty.... If you want to order some drink at this restaurant, you should choose either beer or wine. I also wish if they have better desert selection (maybe hire a dessert chef?) but will definitely visit this place again.', I really wanted to love this place. I am probably giving it an extra star, because i do think it deserves another chance. the good:the service is impeccable. they give you purse hooks, so you arent throwing your purse on the ground like a dirty bar rat. our waitress (who was a zoey deschanel doppelganger), introduced the dishes beautifully and timed everything to a T. i loved the beets and my friend loved her scallops. her cocktail (cannot remember name) was also awesome. light and airy. the bad: everything went kind of downhill after that. we got risotto which was WAY too salty. we split it and could barely finish it without many glasses of water. i got the waygu beef which was overly fatty - i realize and expect there would be some fat, but it wasn't tolerable. my friend's shrimp was almost flavorless.i will probably give it an another chance once they change over the menu for the next season., Love love love this place! Been here a couple of times within the past 3 months and can't say enough good things about it to my city friends. Took some out of towners there last Friday and they were also impressed. Will look for any opportunity to go back again. Service, food, drinks were all good!, Our friends made a reservation for this new restaurant. It is contemporary in style and dining. It's location is somewhat questionable, next to an empty lot past the south loop area. Parking was easy and there is a valet available.I did not drink (due to health reasons) but my three comrades ordered specially mixed drinks suggested by the mixologist. Honestly, the gin, Italian lemon soda, and ginger cocktail was not good. My husband drank it, anyway, because he loves Italian soda.If you are eating because you are hungry, this is NOT the place to dine. However, if you are eating for a pleasant environment, with good friends, and for a different food experience, this IS the place to try. Food portions were very small. My chocolate salad was a mouthful. Delicioso! I ordered the halibut, which was also prepared beautifully. My piece was a three inch square, probably 3 ounces worth. My friend ordered the same entree, and the piece was twice the size, probably 6 oz. So, consistency? I am not sure. Since I am on no carbs, passing up the cute little biscuits was hard.I asked if there were some fresh berries I could order for dessert because I am a diabetic. Everything was full of sugar. The dessert chef did their anyway and just took more insulin afterwards. It was very good sorbet.From the front of the house to the back, the wait staff is impeccable. The service could not have improved. It was letter perfect.Would I return? Perhaps, if there was a change in the menu to include more vegetable dishes and larger portions of protein. All in all, we had a great dining experience but only for a hefty price.If you are to impress someone, this would be the place to take someone for dinner. Just have an open pocketbook., 'Not only is the food absolutely amazing, but the staff truly makes dining at Acadia a 5 star experience. This is a refreshing break from the pretentiousness that usually accompanies a restaurant of this caliber. Jason, Justin, Tyrone, everyone from the kitchen to the bar is amazing! A definite must try.', 'Go here. That is all.', 'My wife and I dined at Acadia last night with another couple. I entered with extremely high expectations based on the accolades Acadia has received so far and thought that I was in for a Michelin star type experience. While our meal was certainly decent, there were unfortunately some disappointments and gaffes; Acadia failed to live up to the hype. Fortunately it is a nice space, has a very talented chef and is still young so the potential remains for Acadia to evolve into a top notch venue.On the positive side there is a nice wine list and I noticed that wines I had seen at other upscale restaurants were a bit less expensive at Acadia. My wife and I were also provided with the option of sitting at the bar or at our table even though the other couple had not yet arrived. The cocktail menu is quite chic with some ultra modern concoctions you might expect to find at The Aviary (i.e. a play on a Gin & Tonic with lemongrass infused tonic and ice cubes made out of kaffir lime). The decor is also trendy and there is a similar vibe to Tru. Soon after our friends arrived our drink orders were taken. There was then a surprisingly lengthy lag before our server came to see if we were ready to order. While I enjoy leisurely dinners, this set a trend where service seemed to be not leisurely but absent at times. Two of us were interested in doing a tasting menu (they do not have an official tasting menu, but you can call and request it in advance or inquire when seated ); unfortunately we were informed that it required entire table participation and two in our party are rather picky eaters, so that was not a possibility. For appetizers my wife and I both ordered their Risotto (in quotation marks on the menu with the twist being that it is potato rather than rice based). I actually enjoyed the Risotto despite the potatoes being woefully undercooked, but my wife did not like the taste or texture of the nearly raw potatoes. The table shared a charcuterie plate as a second course and this was a hit; the chicken liver mousse was outstanding and I really enjoyed the rhubarb jam shaped like chocolate chips. After the appetizers comes the bread service which consists of a single (but incredibly delicious) biscuit per person with housemade butter. I definitely would have like seconds, but this was not offered. I was a bit disappointed in the entree selection. There was only about a half dozen selections, no specials, and not a single beef item (my wife is a Midwestern girl and loves her beef). I ordered the halibut which was just mediocre. My wife had a hard time finding something appealing and opted for the vegetarian dish which had a stunning presentation, but a paltry amount of food. We wanted to do a cheese course before dessert (and cheese is listed on the online menu) but were disappointed to learn they had no cheese. A nice cheese cart is one area where Acadia really needs to improve if they want to be contenders for a Michelin star. The dessert menu was quite limited with just four selections, all fruit based or with a significant fruit component (this was also a pattern with the savory courses where a specific ingredient, such as creme fraiche, seemed to permeate different dishes). Only two of us opted for dessert; I ordered the Poppy Seed Cake which came with poppy seeds prepared several ways and basil ice cream; the cake itself was delicious and the plating beautiful but the ice cream had a chalky texture and I would never had known it was basil had it not said so on the menu. My friend ordered the Milk Chocolate Cremaux which had a gross appearance and apparently tasted poor to boot. My friend took two bites and let it sit. This is when the service really become surprisingly inept for an upscale venue. Not only did our server not inquire if there was something wrong, he stood off to the side of our table for about thirty minutes staring off into space. Perhaps he was waiting to see if her dessert would eventually evaporate. A couple times I gazed in his direction, looked at my watch and yawned to see if would get the hint. Finally he approached (with a team of servers; plates are always delivered and taken in unison at Acadia as though synchronized service is an Olympic sport). Not a single word was uttered about her having barely touched the dessert. Acadia needs to seriously elevate their game when it comes to service; while many reviews reference good service, tonight was markedly flawed. Synchronized plate clearing is all fine if the service is polished, attentive and personable but with these more important areas lacking, the team approach seemed robotic. Hopefully service will become more consistent as time progresses, the menu more diverse and the desserts improved. Pricing is very reasonable for the quality of the cuisine and the upscale ambiance and the potential is there, but Acadia is not yet ready for prime time'|2
2|acquerello-san-francisco|Went here for Valentine's Day, what a thrilling experience. You will not find anything trendy here but you'll definitely enjoy an intimate and perfectly prepared Italian dining experience. Go with the five-course tasting menu, which they pair with some excellent Italian wines., i agree with nish. this is such a comfortable and perfect dining experience. Giancarlo the maitre d' is great too. he picked a great pairing and sent us a comped desert wine., Italian fine dining at its absolute finest. This restaurant is considered one of the best Italian restaurants in the United States. The room could use an update (upscale 1980's hotel restaurant), but you won't notice once you tuck into your first course. Great wine list and some of the most elegant stemware from which I've ever guzzled the grape. And Giancarlo, co-owner, is one of the most gracious hosts you'll ever meet., 'Hands down the best Italian food I have ever had. Everything about this restaurant is simply perfect: from the attentive staff to the incomparable wine list.', Acquerello serves absolutely fabulous Italian food. My girlfriend and I went here for my birthday, and we loved everything we had. Previous reviewers are right that the dining room is somewhat staid and slightly outdated, but the decor didn't detract from our experience at all; in fact, the quiet atmosphere probably improved our ability to focus on our food. Service was top-notch as well. One of our wines was corked (contaminated with mildewy/moldy cork), and not only did our waiter quickly remove it and remedy the situation, she also educated about this wine phenomenon. Almost everything we ate was perfect. The one slight misstep was the slightly undercooked pasta in the lobster panzerotti. The sea bass carpaccio was otherworldly -- thin yet meaty slices of fish flavored with olive oil, lemon, tomatoes and onion -- and we also enjoyed the tomato and bread soup drizzled with balsamic vinegar. My pasta, the duck ragu tossed with garganelli (penne-like tubes) was perfect. Finally, the grilled dorade was some of the best fish either of us had ever had. Bravo! For dessert, a vanilla panna cotta accompanied by peach gelato, peach slices, and blueberries made a fine end to our meal. Highly recommended (if you have the money, of course!)., 'The best restaurant youe never heard of. I amazed Acquerello somehow flies below the San Francisco restaurant radar. From the service to the food, it one of the most memorable meals Ie ever had. We started off with a parmesan budino, recommended to us by our waiter. We were apprehensive that it might be too mushy, but it was fluffy and delicate -- a perfect start. We also had a soup with little veal meatballs, which was delicious and not too filling. Our entrees included the roast duck over red cabbage agrodolce with chestnuts and caramelized apple, and pork tenderloin. Unbelievably good. Both dishes were tender and delicious, cooked to perfection. Service was amazing -- friendly, accommodating, attentive, and among the most welcoming Ie ever experienced. We brought our own wine (the 2002 Revana Napa Valley cab -- incredible wine, highly recommended) and our waiter was totally fine with it. Corkage was $30, which is a bit higher than I like to pay, but our dessert wine was comped, so I not complaining. Pricing makes it a special occasion restaurant for me, but it certainly not unreasonable by San Francisco restaurant standards. A must for any local.', 'Went here last summer on a special occasion after just moving here. Absolutely top-notch service. We made friends with our waiter and he even scoped out apartments for us and called us the following week! We were a bit underwhelmed by the execution of the tasting menu though. To be fair, we had just stepped off a plane from Italy. We did get to taste a number of great wines though, and when they heard it was my b-day they were quite generous with the pours. Decor was a bit staid, but again the wonderful staff warmed it right up.', 'My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary... The restaurant is not particularly romantic... the decor looks rather dated and the location is a little unsavory. But the the food was excellent! We got the tasting menu with wine pairings. Every course was delicious (including the bread), but the meal was a little long (service a little slow). Our dinner was 2 and half hours long. We were so tired and stuff from the dinner, that we just went home and crash. I would not recommend this place for a romantic meal, but it is a lovely restaurant to take your grandparents, parents or out of town older relatives.3/2007 UPDATE;Service is very nice and attentive. My diver scallops were nicely prepared, except it tasted a touch grainy (rookie mistake). The lobster ravioli, however, was out of the world good. For dessert, definitely try to poach pear on a cloud of angel food cake. Tasted much better than described!', We went to Acquerello last night just an hour or two after getting engaged (thank you, thank you), and had an amazing time. As listed in most of the reviews here, the service was terrific, the wine was excellent, and the menu was a foody's dream. We tried to get a good sampling from all sections of the menu by NOT going the price fix route, though the options there were very tempting. As a result, we were able to taste many more possibilities. From sardines and carpaccio appetizers to asparagus ravioli and dungeness crab fettucini; from duck breast with confit-laced bread pudding to bacon-wrapped scallops with chantrelles and monkfish liver- the care taken in the making of each dish was plain to see and greatly appreciated. The service, as mentioned, was impeccable, but once the waiter found out we'd just gotten engaged, they really stepped it up. Dessert, dessert wines, after dinner goodies- all comped. We left the place bursting at the seems. If and when you go, which you certainly should, don't plan to do much else that night (our entire meal was over three hours long). Do plan to leave happy, however, because this place is great., Last night I scouted a restaurant for my guest of honor dinner at World Horror Convention. The restaurant was Acquerello, a block away from the hotel. They were featured last year as one of the top 100 restaurants in San Francisco. Quite frankly, the furniture all looked like they'd bought it at a hotel liquidation sale. I reserved judgement until I ate. I got the tasting menu with wine pairings, and that was a good choice. They started off by giving me a shooter of orange juice and sweet vermouth. The food was a little bland, but the wine pairings made up for that. Easily the best meal I'd had in ages. Afterward, I stumbled home and rolled around on the couch in a food coma. It was good, but I think I'll not go with the seafood courses for the Guest of Honor dinner. I think this place will be good to take the guests to, but then again I suck at choosing restaurants. I mean, I was raised in a trailer park -- the main appeal to me with this place was how unsteady my walking was when I left., 'We went here for our Anniversary and it was soo romantic..:) Loved the decor, I loved that the tables are away from each other and big enough I can remember what we ate but it was good, I think gnocchi was on the menu..;) The server was super nice and genuine...Updated 01/03/07We went here again for our Anniversary (2 yrs after our 1st time), it was delicious. Prix Fix Menu is $110 with wine and their wine list is mainly what this place is known for. We had the same server, he was nice and remembered us and bought us some sparkling wine, which was so thoughtfull. I had the Polenta Gnocchi with Lamb Ragu and My husband had the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio, both were really good.For entree I had the Veal Cheeks and My husband had the dorade which was a mediteranean white fish. The cheeks were tender, came in a bed of spinach that was tender but not mushy as well as a rutabaga bone filled with marrow...really2 good (which is probably an understatement). The dorade came on a bed of spicy cauliflower, that was delicious, I need to figure out how to do it at home. For dessert, I got some lemon cake and he got some chocolate tarte which was delicious as well.I also agree on the comment regarding the pasta with foie gras, it is a must have. All in all I think this place has ambience, great food and great service, it is well worth the price and drive.', I went to Acquerello on a date on the recommendation of Zagat's and others and was very disappointed. The food was terrible - I mean a few steps below spaghetti in a can. The ambiance of this place is much like a retirement home's bingo room. There was no one in the room other than my date and I that was under 70 years old. Avoid at all costs...., Took my wife last week to celebrate a very special milestone and was not disappointed. Charming and elegant interior. Well-mannered, knowledgeable, and efficient wait staff. Excellent food. The portions are small - so don't hesitate to go for the 5 course tasting menu. If not, 3 courses and dessert are definitely doable without getting more than nicely satisfied.Convenient parking, but I was pleasantly surprised when they kindly asked if we needed them to call a taxi for us. The vanilla gelato with balsamic vinegar was to die for. I had to share it with my wife (in spite of the fact she got her own dessert).Sure its only a few blocks from the edge of the Tenderloin - just don't look the local denizens in the eye!, 'After hearing a lot of great things about this restaurant I was pretty disappointed. The atmosphere is definitely old school -- quite an older crowd and not very lively. It was nice and quiet, which did allow for conversation. There were two major service glitches -- they brought me the wrong entree, and secondly, and more annoyingly, they store your wine on a side table and in our case another table bottle on the same table. They actually refilled our wine glasses with the wrong bottle of wine (from the table next to us). Rather than apologize and bring us a new bottle (since most of the bottle was in the glasses on the table already) they asked us to taste the blend to see if it was ok. Seriously!?! I was highly embarrassed for them, and thankfully I was only there with my out of town family and not there on a business dinner. Getting to the food, my first course was the crab linguine, which was fine, but didn blow me away. I also tried the truffle pasta, which sounded great on the menu but I wouldn recommend it -- it was actually a very sweet sauce, not at all what I was hoping for. My first entree (the wrong order) was the duck which again was just ok. The correct entree, the Kobe beef, was actually pretty good. Overall I wouldn return to this place, mainly the service issues, but also it just doesn compare to more modern innovative restaurants that are available in SF for similar $$$$ (and it was pricey). I expected more. Update: I can believe that this place got a Michelin star.', it's been far too long since i've gone back, but my meal at acquerello was an unforgettable experience.to this day, the toothsome tastiness of the pasta still haunts me.i believe i had a sampler dish of the various pasta, and the standout offering was so simple yet divine: a thin linguini-like pasta served with succulent chunks of crab meat, chives, and butter.this is also the first place where i tried truffle cheese.and one word: PAPPARDELLEcan't wait to go back.it's a bit old school, as in pastel colors and chairs with light floral upholstery., I'm glad so many people like this place. I actually thought I found a sort of hidden gem. It was actually quite easy to get a reservation for a Friday night at 6:45... I called only 2 days in advanced to take my mom and her friend there for her birthday. We were immediately greeted with a little cocktail that started off the meal perfectly. I think that their corkage fee is steep, but they take the time in decanting and presenting it so nicely. Now on to the FOOD!!! It was exceptional. The fish that night was the Dorade and was PERFECTLY cooked. My mom's friend said that was the best fish he has EVER eaten period. A month later, he can still taste it. I'm just going to stop now and simply say, if you have a special occasion, GO TO ACQUERELLO. It's romantic, not too crowded, and the food is exceptional., 'I could never afford this place but my parents took me here for my birthday and it was really good. I had a pumpkin gnocchi. The wine was good as well.The food was almost as good as a few in Italy.', The first time I ever went there was about ten years ago and Art Garfunkel was sitting at the next table. I've been back several times. While this meal will cost you, you get what you pay for. And if you bring a date, your pretty much guaranteed to get laid., Hits on all cylinders. Giancarlo in the dining room, Suzette in the kitchen - what could be better. This restaurant always makes me feel special, wine recommendations are perfect, details are always attended to and the food is terrific. There is an overall feeling of integrity in how they operate that is rarely matched in any business. I know they do this for the money, but it just never feels like that's their real motivation., 'FOOD: Orgasmic. The meal started with a complimentary vermouth-orange-carrot shot thingy. We then shared the warm octopus salad ($12): perfectly seasoned squid on a white bean puree - a generous portion, even when shared. I then had a secondi for my entree - the foie gras pasta ($18). This was the BEST PASTA IE ever had. It was the perfect amount of thick tubed pasta with the most unexpected, thick seared foie gras sauce....Even my boyfriend, who is not a foie gras fan, couldn divert his focus from my plate. (The pasta could be paired with a dessert wine but is also perfect with the verdicchio.) He had the stuffed pork chop. It was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. Cappuccinos and desserts were good too. UNINTENTIONAL HUMOR: My boyfriend, who does not drink, was offered the wine list. After i ordered my glass the waiter insisted that my boyfriend order something. He ordered a Coke. The waiter was confused and offered the wine list again. My boyfriend insisted on his Coke. Needless to say, the Coke never arrived. We doubt our waiter knew what it was. SERVICE: Outstanding. The waiters look more like lawyers and bankers and are as knowledgeable as any good sommelier. The busboys are unusually attentive and smiley. The only other restaurant with parallel service is Danko. DECOR: The restaurant is inside an old church!! 80s meets hotel chic. The terracotta walls provide a soft feel and pair nicely with faux-venetian watercolors. Pretty absurd but a good conversation piece.', 'This is my favorite restaurant in the city. The food is incredible!...my favorite is the pasta sampler and the scallops. I can go on about the food for days..it is simply fantastic. the interior is classy, comfy and elegant.now about the service.....as good as the food. incredibly attentive, informative, friendly.I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a trully great dining experience.', I'll admit that the food was good, but when ranked amongst their peers from a price (gauging) perspective, I wasn't impressed...If I've already made plans to spend my mortgage on dinner, I'd rather pass my dollars to Danko's..., I felt completely underdressed as soon as I walked in the door. There were a lot of older couples dressed in suits/ties and evening gowns and businessmen seemingly having a business meeting/dinner. My bf was wearing jeans, dark jeans, but still jeans and I was dressed pretty casual. Either way, the waiter/host never seemed to glance or care what we wore and we were given a choice between sitting at a table side by side or face to face. We chose side by side and we were at the corner facing everyone so we can people watch and observe what they were eating. The menu didn't seem to have much for vegetarians however our waiter tweaked the plates to make it vegetarian for me. We both had three courses and shared a dessert (a trio of sorbet with these walnut biscottis) and I left completely stuffed and satisfied. The waitstaff seemed to be more attentive to the older larger groups having wine with them and giving them more samples and tastes of wine/champagne but either way they didn't treat the other younger diners as second class citizens which I appreciated., 'The food is good, but not outstanding. I had four courses and the best, by far, were the two that required the least preparation: heirloom tomato salad and the cheese plate. As for the pasta dish and the main course... they tried for greatness but didn quite make it. The service was great. Ditto the wine. But with the prices this place commands, your money is better spent elsewhere. Acquerello doesn fully deliver on its promise. The overall experience- good, and in a culinary city like this one, good just isn enough to make me go back.', Who should dine here: People looking for a quiet, romantic dining experience. Worth traveling for, although if only in town for a couple of days, there are better options.1 Star - Lacking/Turn Off2 Stars - Needs Work, But fixable3 Stars - Adequate4 Stars - Near perfect, rough edge here or there5 Stars - Can't get much BetterAmbience: Very romantic and quiet restaurant, without being too stuffy. The decor could use some work, but overall the setting is very nice and very comfortable. 4 stars.Service: Overall the service was pretty good. They did everything right, but didn't do much of the extras. For instance, one server plated our dishes instead of having two servers plate at one time, that is often the case at four/five star establishments. Too different waiters, one a little stuffy at first but he opened up half way through the meal. They didn't miss a beat, they weren't pushy, or snobby. They do a good job at making you comfortable and base their level attention on what your needs are throughout the dinner. 4 stars.Food: This was by far the highlight of the night, absolutely fantastic. They had an option for a 5 course white truffle meal that we past on, but it looked fantastic, and at $250 (Including watching wine pairing) was actually reasonable for what you get. We had two pastas that were just fantastic. The ridged pasta with foie gras and black truffles is a must, don't leave this restaurant without ordering this dish. We also had the Ragu of veal sweat breads and chanterelles over pasta, it was great and the flavors were very wonderful on the palate. For entrees we had the veal cheeks and the pork. Both were really solid, and very tasty. The veal is definitely rustic and matches with a nice Brunello or Baralo perfectly. For desert we opted for the warm chocolate cake, with coffee ice cream. It wasn't the best warm chocolate cake I have had, but the way the flavors all came together with the ice cream and chocolate pieces on top made the dish really incredible. This restaurant really knows how to combine flavors to make them dance. 5 Stars.Wine: This restaurant has the best Italian wine selection of any restaurant in the city. The list of Baralos, Barbarescos, and Brunello is deep and includes all the best names and years. Prices are very fair, especially for the older vintages. I found the list was well thoughtout, with respect to the particular producers that were chosen and the vintages. Nothing drives me more nuts than a restaurant putting a big name wine from a bad vintage on the list, and charging the good vintage price. You don't have to worry about this at Acquerello. The other great thing about the wine experience here is that no matter what you order they decant the wine into a beautiful decanter for you at a little side table next to your table. If you are a wine lover (especially Italian wine lover) you are going to really enjoy Acquerello. 5 stars.Overall: 5 Stars. If you live in San Francisco, or visit the city often, this is a must for your romantic night out with your significant other. This restaurant does everything right, there are some tiny items they could smooth out to bring it to Gary Danko type stature, but overall you will not walk away unfulfilled. Bon appetite!, This restaurant has one of the best tasting menus I've ever had. Plus, the pours on their wine pairings were generous. It was worth every penny., 'Elegant. romantic. the best Italian in SFexpensive but worth itfree orange juice and vermuth apertif to start withamazing tasting menu and pasta', Hmmm...can you say tradition encrusted? Well, this is what it all about when going out to a classy place. The service and food is exceptional. My fiance took me here for my birthday. We had the Chef's tasting menu paired with a nice glass of wine to match each course. Let me tell you, they were generous with the wine. It's a bit pricey, but worth it. We felt a little under dressed though, we were presentable, but I think we would have fit in a little more with business casual or business attire., 'I went to Acquerello a few months ago. Normally, I not a big fan of high-end Italian food. Perhaps it can be attributed to growing up in North Beach and having access to good Italian food without a huge price tag. I was very pleasantly surprised by Acquerello. It was quiet, unassuming and not at all pretentious. There were folks with children having a family dinner at the table next to ours --- this is an unusual sight for many high-end restaurants, but it was a very refreshing one. To me, it meant that the restaurant can cater to a range of clients. Acquerello had a prix fix with wine pairings, but we decided to order a la carte since I was the designated driver and a light-weight. The Pasta with the foie gras sauce was TO DIE FOR. After several months, I still thinking about that pasta. The rest of the meal was also excellent; however, it paled in comparison (of course) to the pasta. I like foie gras, but I don love it the way some other folks do, but I definitely think honey, youe missing out, if you don order it.', Acquerello is a real treat. Tiny place. No bar. However, the service is excellent and the food is tremendous. It's one of those dining experiences that makes you check your watch at the end and wonder where all the time went., A very elegant restaurant with ever so tasty food.I definately suggest what Nish N. said: go for the 5 course tasting menu! I've had some of the greatest dinners here. The staff is excellent. The atmosphere is so charming and romantic and lovely!A VERY good date spot., 'Without question, this is a 5-star Yelp establishment. This place is my local neighborhood version of Chez Panisse. We had the chef tasting menu which came with 5 courses, each paired with a different wine. This does not include the complimentary apertif, and the warm biscotti and coffee (I am just now realizing that the coffee and biscotti were complimentary).The food was outstanding. What wlll really have me coming back is the service. Impeccable. The waiters kept refilling my wine glass whenever I emptied it during a course. This, for me, is unorthodox and unprecedented. They even gave my wife a free glass of wine.The total bill (including 20% tip) came out to $384 and it was WORTH EVERY RED CENT!!!The outrageously professional wait staff have been working as a team for over 17 years. You can tell...', This place doesn't get 5 stars only because I went with my boss. But it was ummm,ummmm good none the less.Do you think this review will give my husband the hint?, I feel like I gotta review just because my experience was so different from everyone else's.Overall, very average and very overpriced.I was hoping for an romantic dinner, what I got was faded, old decor and pretty bland and forgettable food.I ate there almost a year ago, and maybe they've corrected things, I was pretty disappointed., I agree, I didn't like it that much. I thought the sauce was watery and the overall flavor quite bland. I went because of Yelp. Thanks a lot for ruining an otherwise nice evening. In general I find Yelp reviews to be quite useless., I had a nearly perfect dining experience here. My dad came to town and told me to make reservations, and I was more than happy to comply. He didn't give enough notice to get in to Gary Danko or Michael Mina, so I made a reservation at Aqua. After doing a little research, I learned that the place is loud and crowded. Well, my dad has lost a his hearing a bit in his old age and I knew he wouldn't be so into the idea of laying down a chunk of change for a dinner during which he was unable to participate in conversation, so I had to switch it up.Well, I must say I made the right decision. Although I am utterly unable to correctly pronounce the name (I keep trying to add or move r's and l's), Acquerello is amazing. The restaurant is small, but the tables are big and quite spread out. Yes, it is quiet and a bit stodgy, and the decor is a bit dated (though I do like the ceiling), but it is a very conducive space to indulge yourself on excellent food. As one would expect, the service is incredible. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly, and willing to entertain some ignorant questions, yet they still have a touch of that mix of obsequiousness and snobbery that makes you feel like you are dining at a top restaurant. As far as I could tell, they are all men in dark suits, who swarm the table at each course to gently plonk down your dish, all the while being almost entirely unobtrusive.This place earned a Michelin star, and I believe it deserves it. Each dish was incredible--there was nothing I would have changed about the food. The highlight for me was a lobster ravioli--maybe it's because it is almost time for lunch, but just thinking about it makes my mouth water. It is up there as one of the best dishes I have ever had, and I am almost at a loss for words as how to describe it. The sauce was very light, yet creamy, with strong notes of lobster and a mild and wonderful spiciness. The menu has a wide variety of inviting meat and fish dishes, making each of the three courses tough decisions. The wine list is extensive and the waiter helped us pick out some delicious wines that were new to us and well paired with our dishes.Overall, it is totally out of my budget and not much of an exciting scene, but it's a great place to do some some serious eating. Particularly when you aren't paying for it., i was taken here for an early vday celebration. b/c it was a surprise, i was completely under dressed for the occasion. most people in the dining room were wearing suits and dresses while a handful of misfits like moi were wearing jeans and sneakers. but they never once made me feel uncomfortable. the service here is stellar!!! the entire staff is completely unpretentious yet totally professional and knowledgeable. because there arent too many tables here - maybe that's why you get such attentive service. dont worry, they dont hover. i just cant rave enough about their service. on to the food - your best bet is to go with the tasting menu. it's a steal at $110 for 4-5 courses with wine pairings. they were very generous with the wine pourings. the food was also quite tasty. i wasn't too crazy about my main b/c i dont really like pheasant. but overall, it was a great dining experience. i already recommended this place as a special treat to my friends., '5 courses, mostly seafood and shellsfish, which normally I don like. However, aside from the rock salt I mistakenly put in my mouth, my baked oyster was tender and flavorful without being briny or stinky. My tuna, or kampachi, was seared and smooth in my mouth. No place can go wrong with foie gras and blood oranges. each course was paired with an italian wine, none if which I had ever heard of, all of which were easy to drink and went well with the food. One of my unexpectedly best meals in SF since moving here. Not as good as Gary Danko, but SOOOOO close. The meal was finished with a love triangle of chocolate desserts, all of which melted in my mouth like...BUTTAH. Servers, like three to a table, were courteous, gracious and attentive. The other patrons seemed to know the staff here well, like old friends.UPDATE 2/14: One year later and had another fabulous meal. The service is consistently good. The wine pairings were perfect for my tastes. I completely pigged out on the chocolate cart they presented at the end.', The tasting menu was soooo good, and don't get me started on the wine pairings! Perfect wines to match, this meal was amazing. The pasta with foie gras sauce was heavenly, I ate one luscious pasta at a time. Everything was cooked perfectly and the service was outstanding. Marco, our server, was the best! He described everything in detail and really made both of us feel comfortable. He brought out a nice personalized birthday dessert but the best part was the dessert wine. Muscato D'Asti - the most fragrant nose ever!, This quaint and charming Italian restaurant can be found off Polk and Sacramento, not far off Van Ness. I took Art here for his birthday last night. I had booked reservations a month in advance after reading about the restaurant on Open Table. What a discovery! I probably had a smile on my face the whole time we were there! =) The restaurant is dark, cozy and full of character. It definitely gives off a romantic and elegant vibe. The service is friendly and helpful, not pretentious. They gave us a choice of seating arrangements. We decided to sit side-by-side in a corner table. They also promptly brought out a palate teaser shot of orange juice and vermouth with a splash of sparkling water. That was a good sign of things to come ahead. =)The menu wasn't overwhelming but we weren't sure what to order. It had a wonderful selection of appetizers, pastas, and entrees. There was so much that sounded good. Our waiter explained some of the items and gave excellent suggestions. We decided to go the a la carte route. You can also do a 5 course tasting with wine pairings. But, we did 3 courses and glasses of wine of our choice. It was plenty!While we were waiting for our food, they poured us our wines and brought out some luscious soft butter to accompany the warm rosemary and olive bread. For starters, I ordered the grilled octopus salad. It had this pepper oil that gave it a nice kick. I also loved what they did with the olives. It was very delicious. The perfect starter in my opinion. For my second course, I had the lobster ravioli. Wow...it was orgasmic! The raviolis were light and airy and filled with the perfect consistency of ingredients. The sauce was not heavy and they just tasted so fresh and light that they melted in my mouth.So far so good. But, what could possibly top my lobster raviolis?? The diver scallops! It was beautifully presented. I had large scallops topped with an endive salad over a bed of polenta. The perfect balance of taste -bitter, sweet, and right in between. I have never tasted anything quite like it. It was heavenly, let me tell you. The best part of all this, the portions are designed so you can actually finish all of the courses and not feel like you've overstuffed yourself. To top it all off, for dessert, we had a trio of sorbet - kiwi, kumquat, and my fave -- meyer lemon. Jeez, we were heading for serious food coma here. Possibly even buzzed if I had indulged myself in more of the Rotari Rose. The server even poured me a complimentary additional glass. In summary, the food was exceptional, the service - impeccable, and the whole experience is worth the fairly large price tag. It was very personable here, intimate and the connection we had with this rustic fare was by far, the best Italian I've ever had and the experience itself was indescribable. You just have to check it out for yourself! It's definitely one of a kind. Buon Appetito and Bravo, Acquerello! And to my dear, Art...I hope you had a wonderful birthday this year! =), As an Italian, I was relieved to find a place that served food that could be considered 'authentic'. I should tell you that I am quite the stickler on Italian food, and before here, I only ate at one other place in the city outside of family restaurants and homes. My parents were very impressed when I brought them.  Most nights I manage to get to the nearby Mexican restaurant or grab some Chinese, but here is where I am able to show my impeccable manners that have been drilled into me since I can remember.If you go, remember:* Dress nice.* Expect good, cozy character. (Not cheesy Olive Garden* character.)* Come hungry.The service is helpful and very friendly. They know what is in each dish, so don't worry, go ahead and ask. * - Olive Garden is not authentic in any way and the character they offer is up there on the Chuck E. Cheese level. Such a disgrace... ahhh, OK, I'm done ranting., 'WOW...WOW...WOW!! Incredible, fantastic, tremendous, wonderful, marvelous, rattling, terrific, extravagant, fanciful,stupendous phenomenal. Absolutely hands down my best dining experience of the last year. My gf Rose took me there last week ,for my birthday and this place ROCKS, from the service to food they really outdid themselves. For the finer details of our dinner check out her well written review at Rosemarie C. I highly RECOMMEND Acquerello......BRAVO!!', Divine tuna carpaccio, excellent service, attentive staff (even called us a cab after dinner), great decor, etcetera, etcetera...Isn't it enough to say that I will definitely be back?, 'I didnt know they gave free refills on wine... (missed out!)... but I did like the complementary orange juice with vermouth, biscotti, and Italian chocolates (to take home).I had the tuna carpaccio (which was so delicious), pasta with foie gras sauce, and rib eye. I was soooo stuffed that I didnt even finish my steak. SERVICE WAS SUPERB. We were seated in less than 3 minutes. I was seriously amazed that they kept on putting down our plates of food at the same exact second. Great timing! The owner even came around on some occasions to describe the wine or our dishes. He kept on calling me madame which I thought was cute. Overall, a great place for special occasion dining.And I didnt have any problems with the interior. I thought it was cool... (hopefully it wasnt a morgue before like some people were saying).', So hard to augment the other reviews. But having dined here just last night for my birthday w/my parents, here are a few observations, - the experience leaves you 'fulfilled,' like reading a good NY Times article (vs. the local rag)- oddly enough, they mixed up my mom's and my plates (scallops and salmon); we didn't want to highlight the error after such a display of service (4 servers for 4 of us)- we shared the pasta with foie gras/truffles; while the sauce was wonderful (although sweet), the pasta tasted store-bought (and there wasn't much of it)- our head waiter seemed distracted and bored- we all know the prices were a bit steep, but $11 for dessert?- something about the windowless, church-like setting was out-of-place- it was more my dad's kind-of-place than mineBut, what could you not like about the touches of the oj/vermouth, biscotti before dessert and parting pouch of chocolates? It was a nice cap to my birthday. Thanks, Mom!, One of the most memorable dinners I have ever had! Perfection. I immediately fell in love with the beautiful space and enjoyed the pairings with each course. I can't wait to go back., 'Acquerello has been a staple in the city for 17 years and given how fickle diners can be in a town well known for its selection of restaurants, that saying something. However, I really wanted to like Acquerello more but was left a bit unimpressed.I went late last year for my birthday. The dining room was a little dated and the furnishings looked a little too much like a hotel lobby. While it was comfortable, quiet, romantic and there was ample space between tables, it just had a very old school stuffiness about it. I felt like this is where the SF old money has dinner.Even the waitstaff, while professional and courteous seemed very much like stuffed white shirts lacking any real personality. I felt like the old bankers from the WAMU commercials were the waitstaff.The meal started with them bringing some fruit juice beverage as an amuse bouche, which I didn care for at all. I had the Lobster panzerotti in a spicy lobster brodo as my starter and while it was good, it just wasn anything special. It lacked an oh wow factor.As for my entree I had the stuffed pork chop, again it was good but nothing stellar.For dessert a bavarian and a chocolate cake. These were actually not all that special and rather disappointing.I would not rush back to Acquerello, its not that anything was bad but considering the prices I expect more.The restaurant is just too staid, while the food is good its not interesting or innovative enough to justify the price. For practically the same money I would rather go to Boulevard or Gary Danko.On the plus side, parking was easy as there was a pay lot right across the street.Service: 3.5Food: 3.75Atmosphere: 3.5The whole is less than the sum of the parts because based on the price, it just a 3 star experience.', Never has it seemed so natural to go with the flow..... so far be it from me to give this place anything other than 5 stars. The unassuming entrance gives way to a sumptuous dining area with a definite Mediterranean feel from the crisp white table cloths and pastel colours on the wall.My wife had the Burrata, which was outstanding, as creamy as any I have ever had, and definitely on a par if not better than A16. The Garbanzo soup with octopus salad was a delicate yet hearty mix to warm me up on a foggy night in SF. For Entree we had the Dorada and the herb crusted Veal. My wife and I usually decide during dinner who made the better choice, but this time it was a tie! Both dishes were fabuolous and didn't stuff us too much, to leave space for the cheese trolley. I always like being able to select from the cheese trolley, and the chef/owner of Acquerello actually came out to explain the various cheeses on offer, which was a nice touch. We washed it all down with a bottle of Barolo, one of the biggest wines of Italy, recommended by the sommelier, and we left two very happy campers!We had an early sitting of 6-30pm, but the place still had atmosphere and I didn't feel rushed at all as we left around 9pm. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place for a cozy romantic meal for two, or a place to take someone on a special occasion. And next time, I am trying the tasting menu!!, Where do I begin with reviewing Acquerello? My boyfriend and I have gone here numerous times since we moved to the city in May, and it is by far one of our favorite restaurants not only in the city, but in the country. Being Italian, I have eaten Italian food all my life, from all different regions, and this is by far the best I have had. The first time we went here it was for my bf's birthday.. We didn't have any reservations, and were also dressed a little too casual (he was in jeans, polo and a blazer, I was in jeans and a dressy shirt, while a majority of the customers seemed to be in suits and ties/dresses and skirts) but that was not a problem, and Giancarlo never seemed to look twice at our attire or our age (the other patrons were much older, probably between 40-60, while we aren't even 25 yet.) We were sat at one of Franco's tables, and the rest is history. As far as service goes, it is the best I have ever received (I would say is on par with French Laundry, if not better because it is less stuffy and more personal.) Everyone is extremely knowledgeable about the wines and the menu, and they make you feel like you are dining with them in their home rather than in their restaurant. The food is amazing, and the wine list is spectacular. That first night (and pretty much every night since) Pete (my bf) orders the tasting menu and I normally order off of the regular menu ( I ordered the tasting menu once and while delicious, was too much food for me.) The food is always fantastic. I cannot think of one thing that we have ordered from this restaurant that we did not love. I don't remember what the exact dishes where that first night (and the menu changes regularly) but the dishes that stand out in my mind are the Kobe beef, Parmesan budino, char, carpaccio, the gnocci with the lamb and beef ragu is to die for, the venison loin...I could go on and on. Since that first visit, we have gone many more times, and when our family comes out to visit we always take them here, and they have never been disappointed. (I have never seen my bf's father react to food the way he reacted to his Parmesan budino) and my mother said it was the best meal she has ever had in her whole life. The last time we went was on Valentine's Day, and we are in desperate need of going again. I would HIGHLY recommend Acquerello to anyone looking to have a great meal. Just don't be in a rush, as a meal there for us typically last anywhere from 2-3 hours., I have been wanting to dine here for a long time, so this was a treat. The service was incredible - perfectly attentive, willing to offer suggestions, charmingly Italian, and never an empty wine glass. The gnocchi with lamb and kobe beef ragu was delightful. Gnocchi is often described as 'potato pillows' but usually, unless you sleep on rubber pillows, the description doesn't fit. Here, however, they were so soft and billowy, I could have put my head right down into the bowl and taken a nap. Ok, not really, but you get my point.The reason for 4 and not 5 stars is that I thought my entree, scallops wrapped in pancetta, was just ok. While the scallops were perfectly cooked and seasoned, the dish had a metallic aftertaste that I can't place.But, all was redeemed by the cheese cart. Not only were the selections wonderful, but the description of each had us (and the couple at the table next to us) captivated. After I chose three, he insisted on adding a fourth. Then, he selects the accompaniments that suit each cheese, and puts little dollops of things like hazelnuts in honey, candied fennel, etc. on the plate. Seriously, I think this cheese experience outshines Danko., 'We had the opportunity to have a private holiday party at Acquerello for our indoor soccer team - and the four course meal was divine!I believe the building is an old church and the atmosphere inside is relaxing and cozy.', 'Food and service here was very good. I had the lobster ravoli and lamb which were both very good. The panacotta for dessert was also very refreshing. I sampled a few other dishes and I have no complaint on any of them. The fried froigras was freaking awesome. Very, very good. I would recommend the tasting menu for $75 with no wine if this was your first time going. The atmosphere of the restuarant is nice and quaint with rich old people sitting around yelling Hey BuffA, ha! ha! ha! for an expensive italian meal. I am glad I tried it once but nothing had won my fat stomach over for a repeat.', 'Mmmm.... I like this place...At first I thought I was going to someone apartment when I found the restaurant. It on the first floor of an apartment building, and it shares the same entrance as the residents of the apartment. Next to it, there a ghetto Vietnamese/ Chinese nail place that the open light is on when it is actually close, and there isn many restaurants/ business near the Acquerello in the neighborhood.But I really like how it is inside. It not a big restaurant, but it an open space 1-room dining area where it has high ceiling so you feel comfortable being in there. Hubby and I sat at the corner where we could sit side-by-side, facing the entire room.The waitress was very professional and knowledgeable of the food and wine so be sure to always ask her for suggestion especially on the wine, and she actually reminded me of Rachel Weisz cuz she got the same cute face w/ dark features. Anyway.... She was our waitress but all the waiters/ waitresses help each other out so everything moves quickly. Very efficient.The food was wonderful too. I have to be honest with you that I don remember what hubby and I ate, but it not b/c the food isn good. It really just me. I can never remember what we order at a restaurant but know what I think of the food and place. I agree with Stacey K. that it a bit pricey, but since I had such a great time there, I still gave it a 5-star.Parking is never good around that area, so give yourself an extra 10-15 minutes to find parking there.', Quaint, off the beaten path, romantic restaurant with a modern flair that is one of the lesser known upper priced restaurant.But where's the WOW factor? Try Delfina instead., 'What can I say you pay for a wonderful restaurant. The wines will be served in Cantors and they actually have the REAL Red wine glasses. They even fold your napkin for you when you go to the ladies room.', 'The food here is wonderful. Italian dining with the feel of an upscale French restaurant--we had a five course tasting meal with excellent wine pairings in a five star, yet friendly ambiance. The interior is understated but very elegant and unique. The waitstaff is extremely courteous, friendly, and knowledgeable. I highly recommend dining here particularly for special occasions.', I like the food here but the ambiance, well if your someone who enjoys a more interesting , more colorful and lively dining experience then this is definitely NOT the place. It was a former funeral parlor I believe and it still looks it! Kind of sad. Well It's expensive and very good food and wine for a boring evening., We brought my mom to acquerello for dinner to celebrate mother's day. Food is delicious but really, for the price, it should have been phenomenal: we had beef carpaccio, amazing house made pastas including the giant lobster ravioli, the veal rib eye and the steak, and a cheese course. Everything was good, but I did not enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant at all. I was shocked that so many people think this place is romantic! It was painfully quiet and overwhelmingly pastel. Honestly, it felt like we were in the midst of a retirement community's dining room. Plus, our waiter was distracted the entire evening and always had one eye trained on the rest of the restaurant while he spoke to us. My mom had fun, but I wouldn't return., One of the best meals that I've ever had and I'm an eater!! The wine was fabulous and the gnocchi just melted in my mouth. I was taken here for a special occasion, and I thought it was perfect because it's on the pricey side, but every bite is well worth it. Service was great, our waiter was very friendly. If you want to impress some one this is a very sneaky place. It's not your typical Italian restaurant. My man loved the food and he's Italian, so that says a lot., It doesn't get any better than this! Great friend and excellent service by a staff that knows the menu and is very good at wine pairings. Very pleasant decor. Parking is the only issue and that won't keep me away.|2
3|alinea-chicago|Grant Achatz is a culinary genius. Alinea offers three tasting menus: 8 courses, 12 courses, and 25 courses. I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to enjoy the chef's 12 course tasting menu and it was truly amazing. Throughout my entire experience, beginning to end, I felt as though I was going through a deeply satisfying romantic relationship, from the first date jitters, to the comfort of something familiar, to the dread of knowing that it was going to end soon, to complete satisfaction with no regrets. The wide array of flavors, aromas, and textures created a near sensory overload in the mouth. You could have a 180 degree change of flavors in one single bite. The service was top notch. Attentive without being overbearing, and extremely friendly with good senses of humor. If this was the last meal that I ever ate, I would die happily. In fact, I can't think of eating anything else at the moment because of the sheer satisfaction I got from this meal! We were fortunate to tour the kitchen and meet Chef Achatz, which was a treat in itself. The menu changes every couple of months or so, so you'll always be in for a surprise!, 'This two story place of heaven offers a floating staircase with comfy armchairs to try their tasting menus - six courses run about $75 and 12 courses $110 - which can last about 4-5 hours to try everything. Try the foi gras dessert and the wine pairings are fantastic. Service and food are equally amazing.', 'OMIGOD... coming from a culinary town such as SF, I had high expectations. Every expectation was surpassed! This was the most amazing culinary experience of my life. From the waitstaff to the presentation to, of course, the food there was a rush of anticipation and sometimes wonder; as in how do I eat this?. Great atmosphere, amazing food, unbelievable experience!', 'A night at Grant Achat Alinea ranks as one of the best meals of my life. Everything about this meal was exquisite - from the service, to the atmosphere, to the food. The French style service is extremely attentive and classy and our sommelier was very knowledgeable and chatty as we made our way through the wine paring. Be aware that the wine can drive an already large bill into the stratosphere especially as the sommelier will occasionally upsell you to a more offbeat wine. We spent $500 (without tip) for two people on the 12 course meal with wine pairings and 2 upsells. I don regret either of the occasions I chose his alternate recommendations - both were fantastic and unusual styles of familiar grapes - a Pinor Noir and a Grenache. They seem to have simplified the menu the taste (12 courses) and the tour (22-26 courses). We rolled out of there after a mere 12 courses in 4 1/2 hours. According to our waiter, the 24-ish course meal could take anywhere from 2 1/2 hours (chefs) to 7 1/2 hours (whew). The entire meal contained elements of drama that targets all the senses and youl never be short of conversation (however long your meal is) as Chef Achat gives you plenty to talk about as he leads you though this spectacular 12 act culinary show. Some of the dramatic highlights: Hot Potato (cold potato, black truffle, and parmesan). Our first dish came in a miniature bowl with a skewer stuck through the side of the bowl on which a cold potato ball, a sliver of black truffle, and parmesan were suspended over the bowl. Our waiter instructed us to remove the skewer allowing everything to drop into a cold potato soup, which we then knocked back like a decadent shot. Lamb (akudjura, nicoise olive, eucalyptus veil). Our waiter sat a large bowl full of warm eucalyptus leaves in front of us. Nestled in the middle of this fragrant and beautiful bowl was a skewer with a cube of lamb and an olive on it. Duck (persimmon, onion, pillow of mace air). Easily the most dramatic dish. A cloth pillow filled with mace scented air was placed in front of each of us and a dish with duck confit, duck breast and fois gras was placed on top. As we dug into this dish the air was slowly released from the pillow mixing with the food smells and leading us to visions of Alinea branded mace spray for linens. UPDATE: Check out the review in Wired: wired.com/wired/archive/43_', 'The most expensive meal in my life...and somehow one of the best values in my life. How can that be? The drama of merely entering the restaurant is enough to take your breath away, and then the service, calm and sophisticated ambience, little gee-whiz gadgets and tricks, and the food, oh the food.... We were not able to get reservations for the tour, 25 courses or so. But our 12 course tasting was more than plenty at $125 a pop for the food, and I think that once he rotates through some new dishes I will go back for the easier on the wallet 8 course. We did the wine pairing, which they say is around 2/3 the cost of the food. My math says that $90 compared with $125 is more like 3/4ths, but who counting at a place like this. The wines were just as memorable as the food, and I strongly recommend that you a) go for the wine pairings, or at least some of them, and b) make sure youe taking a cab afterwards. How so much flavor can be packed into single bites, and then how I can get so richly full from these single bites, will always be a mystery. I could go through the highlights, but that would require walking through all 12 dishes. Only one that Il mention as such a surprise was the Kobe beef with teriyaki reduction, cucumber, and...melon? Who in the world says to themselves, Hmm...what goes well with Kobe beef? Oh, I know, honeydew melon of course! Genius. Like many foodies-in-training, I seek value. Alenia is a place that proves that ridiculously, guilt-inducing prices can sometimes still be a value when it buys 3 or 4 hours of food perfection.', 'This place it a lot like Tru (but not quite as good). Still a very upscale restaurant and very much worth trying. They have very unique ways of serving your dishes here. We went two times and both times we were very impressed. The chef here and at Tru both started out in Evanston at Trio (which is now closed). My first date with my fiance was at Trio 9 years ago and it was an experience that I never had until that day. Definitely would recommend trying Alinea for a unique experience.', 'I went during the first month or so of the opening, getting extremely lucky to get in on a Sunday night with just a phone call. I don know how to review this place. This was hands down the best meal of my life, if I can even call it a meal. It was more like a religious experience. Some of the more memorable dishes...granola rolled inside a very thin tube of fruit leather that has been hardened to the point where it can crack. This is served over a creamy nut-based yogurt. You crack the granola tube into the yogurt to produce wonderfully crunchy glasslike shards. The textures were very interesting. Another one that I really loved was a pongecakewhich involved a piece of very light spongecake on the end of a vanilla bean used as a spoon to eat some sort of fruit foam and dehydrated fruit bits. Again excellent combinations of unusual textures really added to the experience. Grant Achatz is a true artist. I hope to visit again one day, when my wallet recovers :)', I think I'd better write a Yelp review on this baby even though I went there just over a year ago. Wow. Just, wow. From the non-descript exterior, to the minimalist art in the foyer, to the comfortable chairs, the atmosphere was just right. My friend and I decided that this would be the ultimate in our food adventurings. We were right. We tried the 12 course menu and each item was like a tiny work of art. My favorites included a carrot ravioli with a coconut powder filling served in a lobster consommee with lobster chunks and a lobster cracker and a tiny bison filet wrapped in potato strings and flash fried and served with a spice gel cube, pistachios and pistachio puree. Our server was friendly and informative. We went on a little tour of the restaurant after our meal, and then wandered dazed onto the dark sidewalk clutching our souvenir menus. An experience well worth every penny., We had the 12 course tasting and were blown away at how inventive each course was. First up was a semifreddo of coconut and corn, with teeny tiny accents of lime zest, cayenne, and another savory flavor which escapes my memory. WOW. Some diners might be put off on the constant instruction on how to eat (in this course I was told to eat it all in one bite, which I misunderstood to eat in small bites!), where to place the used or unused utensils, etc. I think the servers mean well, though the instructions are part of a script. I won't be able to recall every course but will bring you the highlighs. Our favorites were a fried puff of langostine with lychee, ginger, and vacherine served on a fragrant vanilla bean, like a popsicle. This course, like others, had a custom-made serving contraption (for lack of better words!), as does the applewood smoked bacon and butterscotch, which is served on a wire trapeze. We adored the hot potato- cold potato (reviewed by another Yelper below) and the watermelon dusted with cocoa, Kobe beef, with pickled watermelon and fennel reduction. Too bad that I didn't write this review this weekend, with every course fresh in my memory!, We went to Alinea last night, which completes our trio of experimental dining (Moto, WD-50 in New York, and now.. Alinea). I have to say... Alinea is great. The entrance is really cool, the service is what you would expect, and the food is excellent. Achatz is indeed a genius, but in the end... the experience isn't really that memorable. I feel like he cut his teeth at Trio, and is delivering interesting, but not amazing food, in an interesting but not amazing space. What I would say tho.. is if you're going to spend $450+ on dinner for two... and you've got one place to go in Chicago, we'd still go to Moto. Achatz's food is interesting, but not amazing... which when you're dropping that sort of cash, you need to be able to walk away and remember your experience for months to come. At Moto we had exactly that... both for the service and food. So... if you haven't been to Moto, I'd go there first... if you have... Alinea is great, but it won't be quite as fantastic., 'I suddenly remember...hmm, I going to Chicago in 2 weeks with the girl to see her friend. I wonder if there a half chance in hell...nah...well, ok, let try... 11pm Pacific on a Saturday night I call, expecting to get reservations 2 weeks out at one of the most talked about restraunts in the US. Il get voicemail for sure.A woman voice answers. 5 minutes of polite conversation later I shocked to realize Il be dining at Alinea in 2 weeks. While I familiar with dress code, etc at high end restraunts, the hostess didn wait for me to ask, but offers info regarding seating arrangements, dress, and aks if I have other questions. It 1AM for her and she being more polite and helpful than I could imagine.Responsorial for the next few days: I get to go to Alinea!!!!Reservation was for 9:30. We arrive at the famed entrance, door slides open, and the hostess refers to me by name at first sight. Nice touch. Girl wouldn let me go with more than the 12 course option because of the time of night, but seeing as how we were there ill nearly 1am, that quite fine.The photos on the website are pretty much memorized - when the first course appears, I practically giddy just looking at it. Not sure if it was due to time of night, or Chef heard we were from 2 timezones away, or what...but we ended up getting 3 extra courses tossed in during the night as gifts from the kitchen. DIdn see that happening at tables around me. Overall, it is purely an experience you will find nowhere else.Beyond the food - the decor was a little bland, in my opinion. If I just walked through, not knowing where I was, I would say things felt sterile. Lighting, soemthing needs to change and provide just a tiny bit of mood. The wait staff the night I was there were great, but not *quite* at the top of their game. Barely noticable.An interesting point I want to bring up, which I don think others mentioned. When I returned home and told others of my meal, several of my friends were shocked that I dare to spend $700 on dinner for 2 (yes. with tip. Be prepared and bring your Visa). I guess I thought they were a little more of a foodie like I am, and they appreciate/understand. One friend was short of insulted, partially due to the price, partially due to me paying a chef to play with food, when so many out there are hungry and can get nothing. In her eyes it seemed to be totally wasteful, egregious. I think I was as shocked that she had this viewpoint as she was that I indulged.I would very very very happily indulge again. 25 courses next time please!', 'For her 30th Birthday, I took my girlfriend to Alinea for dinner after a play at Steppenwolf. I was hoping to impress her since I of little value otherwise and I think it worked reasonably well. Easily the most incredible service Ie ever experienced. They knew what I was thinking and didn require me to actually say it. I won bore you with the effusive praise Ie been giving this place every time it come up in the past few months since I went, but let me tell you, it fantastic.Yeah, they gave us a menu, but I not really sure why. I was getting twelve courses, damnit, and every wine on the suggested pairing wine course, to boot. So, of course, we didn bother looking over the menu as we much prefer to be surprised. The meal was a healthy three and half hours long and while each course was small, it was plenty of food (see: 12 courses above). For me, it was the perfect amount of food and alcohol. I was in a blissed out coma by the end. For my ever so petite girlfriend, I think eight to ten might have worked a little better, but you won see any complaining from me.It was a truly a memorable that I will never forget. Hopefully shel remember her 30th birthday and smile and hopefully you can experience it for yourself and offer your own condensed, effusive praise on this very website.Best meal ever.', 'Over the top and amazing. When I saw that this place was ranked higher than French Laundry on the Gourmet Magazine list of top 50 restaurants, I knew that I had to go. We had the tour menu which was 23 courses and the wine pairing. At 9:30pm on a Thursday night, we started our tour and we left the restuarant a little before 2am having experienced an explosive array of flavors and combinations. I have to admit, I was tired and sleep deprived from the flight that day so I slept through course 21(even though Paul tried to wake me up) and somehow woke up with chocolate on my face, but it definately wasn due to the lack of innovative and delicious flavors. Ok, not bad I managed to have 22/23 courses. :)', Like everyone else, I was blown away by Alinea. The precision of every course, every progression, is a revelation. Definitely spring for the 25-course menu and the upgraded wine pairings. it's worth it. If I had to come up with a criticism, I would say that I wish the atmosphere was a little warmer and more relaxed and that the service had the easy perfection of Trotter's. But those are minor quibbles if quibbles at all, and this is still easily the best restaurant I have tried. Getting reservations was actually pretty easy for me--I called around a month and a half in advance, and had no trouble getting a Friday night 25-course., 'We had dinner at Alinea on Saturday night with another couple. I don even really know how to describe the meal, but to say that it was absolute perfection on a plate and in a glass. We did the 12 course and wine pairing, with the two upgrades. (You reach a certain point when you find yourself paying $300/person for food/drink/tip that another $20 doesn seem all that bad.) And what a good decision that was - a 2000 Chateauneuf de Pape was served along with lamb seared three ways served on top of the tiniest little smoking granite grill with an infusion of fresh rosemary. I go through the courses, but they wouldn make sense out of context. Let me just tell you that the meal ended with a cinnamon and caramel tempura batter wrapped around a 10 inch cinnamon stick. I might have traded my first born for a dozen of them to go.The service is unparalleled. Our dinner companions have been to Trotters twice and we ourselves have had a fabulous meal or two, but Ie never been so comfortable in an upscale restaurant. I was seated on the equivalent of a comfy couch with beautiful silk pillows at my side. Our team of waiters and sommeliers were serious but not stuffy, knowledgeable but not pretentious and definitely enjoy their work and respect their chef. Grant Achatz is an incredibly gifted chef, notwithstanding he only 32 years old. As we left the restaurant I asked our hostess, who not only sat us, but walked us to the door and hailed us a cab, to point him out in the kitchen. He was leaning over the counter, working along with the rest of the kitchen staff, you would never have known he was the head chef of Gourmet magazine best restaurant in the country. I was thoroughly impressed. Do make a point to try this fantastic restaurant.', 'A simply amazing meal. As another reviewer noted, the menu is simplified, and while Pookie and I were there it was 12 courses or 23. The wine pairings were quite exotic and international, and varied from very good to spectacular for my taste. The food was consistently spectacular. This is an experience, not just a meal. We started the 23 course tour at 9:30pm and finished at about 2:00am. The bill was about $700. We sat in the downstairs dining area where there were 5 tables. Not sure how big upstairs is. Extremely attentive service, relaxed and elegant atmosphere and above all the food and wine is unreal. Highly recommended if you can swing the $.', Wow. I am not a foodie so I won't go into the detailed play by play that you have heard from the other Yelpers.I will say that if you want an amazing dining experience that is incomparable to any other, than come here. The service was impecable. When I went up to go to the restroom, I had two waiters push back the table for me and then one escorted me to the restroom the entire way. Have you ever heard of such a thing?To commemorate the special occasion, my birthday, I was given a take home menu of our courses.Best dining Experience ever., 'Simply AMAZING. What can I say that hasn been said? (Too much, I actually wrote twice as much as this but it was too large for Yelp!)First, the food... Geniusly presented. No matter what anyone might say, it really is unlike anything else. We had the 24 course tour. And what a tour it was. Every course came in some unique fashion. Everything was well thought out, the flavors melded together and contrasted perfectly. The wine pairings were dead on. Occasionally there was too much to know about what you were eating, and even after the waiter explained it for a good long minute, it was easy to forget parts of what was in everything. That was part of the fun, though, because you could sit and really try to decipher everything, much like you might for a fine wine.Word of caution: a good amount of what Alinea is all about is surprise. Is too much press a bad thing? Possibly. If youe planning to go, I wouldn spend a lot of time reading reviews, looking at pictures, reading press articles. It ruins some of the surprise and takes some of the fun away. If you haven been but plan to go, you might skip over the next few paragraphs and go straight to the end. I feel as though I would have benefited slightly by knowing a little less prior to going.If Alinea had its own Academy awards, the awards from me would look something like this:Best sensual experience: Rabbit. Brought to the table covered in a Autumn in a glass filled with the smoke of burning leaves; the waiter lifted the glass and lets the smoke waft. It smelled and tasted amazing. Best sweets: Crabapple, served with three gelatinous sauces: eucalyptus, olive oil (strangely interesting as a jellied sauce), and cheddar cheese. Close second: some sort of puff encrusted foie gras (which we were told was a gift in order to make it legal in Chicago). Most unexpected flavor: during the raspberry course, just when you thought it might be as expected, you bite into red pepper taffy that just pops out at you. Perfectly melds together.Oddest method of eating: Quince wrapped in prosciutto, served at the end of a long antennae. When eating, your hands stay away and you bob your head in and eat it off the tip. It reminded me of a sexual act and I just had to laugh at the time.Best savory tasting course: Either the rabbit or the squab.Best wine pairing: There was a New Zealand Syrah that was among the most peppery and complex wines Ie had.Most unusual ingredient: So many unusual ingredients (to most, at least). Pickled huckleberry, squab, cured trout eggs from Michigan (supposedly 15 hours old), cask aged Belize maple syrup---Blis. The restaurant was bustling with people. There were a ton of people dining, and a ton of people working. Everything was well partitioned, though.Service was good. Somewhat robotic, but in a good way. Somewhat casual, but in a not stuffy way--as opposed to a casual because wee lazy way. We had 4 or 5 people who seemed to be serving us (we seemed to have two waiters, a few expeditors, sommelier for wine), but it still felt personal. There was one minor service hiccup that was probably the result of too many people doing too much different stuff all at once; one of the waiters came to give us new glasses and take our glass of wine that was just freshly poured by another waiter less than a minute before. We told him, and it was not a big deal at all. The wait staff was willing to engage in conversation and even crack jokes, which is always welcomed by me. Upon leaving, the waiter also led us to go inside the kitchen, which was also a nice treat.The food here is art, and many apparently feel the need to bring their cameras. That perfectly OK, but I wish everyone had enough respect for my $900 meal that they turn the flash off while taking pictures. There were some great people watching opportunities. Chico was definitely in fashion for the women, many of the older women there were ber-stylish. I not sure I agree that a jackets required policy for men is necessary for this type of restaurant. There were a lot of men in unmatched blazers, and it just seemed unnecessary and too old school for such a cutting edge restaurant.The only question left somewhat unanswered in my eyes: is it really the #1 restaurant in the country--or even Chicago? We pondered it while we were there, looking around, wondering could it be? I honestly not sure of it, but I put it at either #1 or #2 of the top dining experiences Ie had (for those that are curious what the other contender would be, that would be Tru---but maybe that was exceptionally amazing to me given that we were in the semi-private dining room). Alinea is a foodies paradise, and something everyone should experience. It definitely way up there in the rankings, and after going to a place like this most other restaurants will pale in comparison.', Inventive, enlightening and definitely the best restaurant I've been to in Chicago. The service was phenomenal -- my dining companion's spoon was shifted at the last minute during one course as the wait staff noticed that he was left-handed. (Impressed, he said the last time he had this level of service was at the Bangkok Oriental.) Our 12-course degustacion was memorable, and we were even treated to a tour of the pristine kitchens afterwards. Chicago is truly world-class to have a restaurant like Alinea. As a transplanted foreigner, I rate it on the same level as Spoon., 'Innovative flavors, jaw-dropping preparations, beautiful presentations. I was, but shouldn have been, surprised that in 2006 Gourmet magazine rated it the number ONE restaurant in America (epicurious.com/gourmet/f43_).Some of the dishes are created from the much-lauded sous vide cooking which explains some of the unique textures presented in the dishes. The kitchen hums with an unexpectedly quiet and efficient energy. I was unfortunate enough to have only the 12 course, and wish I had room (and money) for the marathon 24. Remember, though, a course can be as small as a bite-sized morsel (for one example, think Gobstopper on crack). Service was excellent. Case in point: my wife left her butter knife askew on the edge her bread plate and a waiter -- thinking the knife might clatter onto the table -- swooped in to adjust the knife to keep it on the plate! Make reservations and come prepared for an exquisite experience.Upsides:- The best in high-end cuisine. Period.Downsides:- Expensive, but you get what you pay for.- Might be intimidating for the non-foodie.', A lot has already been said about Alinea so I'll just add some highlights of the 5 star meal:* I had a lot of trouble getting a Friday night table for the weekend that my wife and I were going to be in Chicago but finally was able to secure a table the day before. My recommendation to get a table: get on the waiting list for your desired time and call 24 hours before to see if there have been any cancellations. Worked for me.* Food was fun, fantastic, and beautiful. There are only 2 menus, the 12 course Tasting ($125) and the 24 course Tour ($175). Very expensive, yes, but worth it (in my mind) for a truly unique dining experience. If you're in from out of town like we were, I recommend springing for the Tour. If you get the Tasting, you may see some great looking dishes being brought to other tables that you won't get on the Tasting.* If you're on the Tour, don't eat any bread. You will barely be able to finish all the food in the Tour itself. Trust me on this.* The Sommelier poured us some great wine to drink with our meal but it was *extremely* expensive so be careful if you're trying to keep your meal cost out of the stratosphere. I'm talking $22 a glass!* Service is some of the best I've ever experienced.* As you can read in the other reviews, the food here comes in very novel and strange presentations with unusual combinations of tastes - but it's all great. Make sure to come with an open mind and you'll really be in for a treat.* Very cool entryway and door to the restaurant - but sort of unmarked so don't be confused. Cool interior.* They give you a printed menu to take home with you after the meal, which is helpful for remembering what you ate (24 courses is a lot). You can also take pictures with your camera or camera phone if you want to.In summary: I hope you enjoy this place as much as we did!, This place is for the nouveau riche... Plainly and simply the most pretentious excuse for dining I've ever experienced. I'm not quite sure what all the raving over this place is about... is it a status thing, to say that you've dined there? The only thing I really enjoyed about the experience was the service and the atmosphere. Yes, the preparation and presentation of the dishes are creative and unique, but I'm still missing something, something I really don't care all that much to get., I've only been to Alinea once, so I can't give an all-encompassing take, but I will definitely be going back at some point, despite the 800 dollarish tab for two. Without spoiling anything, Alinea was full of unexpected twists and turns from before we even found our way inside. While the restaurant provides a novel approach, full of science-meets-cooking gastronomy, the distinct flavors have the substance to ensure that the experience is not gimmicky. Alinea has a vast wine list that is filled with treasures that are surprisingly (relatively!) reasonably priced at a fraction of the markup of many high end restaurants. Sadly, though, unless you're dining with a big party, it's pretty impracticable to limit yourself to a single full bottle for a meal that covers the entire spectrum of familiar flavors (plus some that are totally new to even well experienced first-timers.) We instead opted for the wine pairings which included about 12 half-glasses for the Tour menu and incorporated a few familiar and many obscure varietals. However, at least on this particular occasion, neither of us felt like the pairings were truly on, and got the impression that a lot of the wines were selected more for their gross margins than their compatibility., 'This absolutely has to have been the best restaurant experience that I have had in recent history. While I was a little apprehensive having gone to another tastings restaurant a couple of weeks before and being underwhelmed, this was all and more that it was touted to be.From the time I walked into the door, everything was perfect. Someone whisked my coat away before I even knew it- no ticket for the coat- yet somehow I knew they would find it when I was ready for it. After being seated in the front room done in shades of gray and purple, we were reminded of the tasting that we chose (12 courses) and were asked if we wanted the basic wine pairings or the more obscure wine pairings. We chose the basic (additional $95 per person) and were not disappointed. There was an Italian Cabanon Bonarda that was absolutely my favorite wine of the night.We started with cold potato soup with a black truffle served like an oyster in a shell and were told to eat it in just that way. The food was not only delicious, but I couldn help wondering with each course how to eat it- challenging myself with options to see if I could come up with how they would suggest the ultimate enjoyment. One of my favorite presentations was a pillow (yes, I said pillow) that was placed at each setting on the table that was filled with juniper air. The smell was amazing and perfectly complimented the duck that was served on it. Or imagine small cubes of lamb on a hot stone with a sprig of fresh rosemary inserted into that stone. The aromatic scent that was released from the rosemary perfectly complimented the lamb which was served 3 different ways. Throughout the night, while we had a multitude of servers, all were well informed about each course and answered any questions that we had. It was great service without any pretense. They do encourage men to wear jackets, however, only one of the men I was with had a jacket and the others were not made to feel uncomfortable- keep in mind this was on a Wednesday night- weekends might be different.If you are looking for a really special night out- this has to be it. It not a cheap date - we spent $1200 for 4 of us, but it was worth every penny. I will definitely be back to see what other surprises this amazing chef dreams up.', 'My girlfriend described her experience as follows:This is like having sex in my mouth!Any questions?-G', 'The four of us flew to Chicago from California one weekend for the express purpose of dining at Alinea. We opted for the 23 course tour menu.Every element of the dining experience at this restaurant is carefully considered, even your first steps into the restaurant. When you enter the unmarked building, you step into a long disappearing corridor. There is an automatic sliding door which surprises you near the end of the corridor. The dcor is modern and minimalistic. There is no tablecloth on the table, but as you will find out, there are many, many pillows that will show up throughout the dinner. There are pillows for our bench seating. There are little pillows upon which to rest your clean utensils. There are even aromatic pillows that accompany a dish, releasing the fragrance of juniper as it slowly deflates sitting under the weight of the dish.Service is impeccable. At least one waiter would stand unobtrusively in the background at all times to tend to our every need. Our first course was a small, bite sized croquette. When one of my dining partners and I joked that we were going to be disappointed if we needed to go out for steak after dinner, a waiter came by a minute later offering us bread. When one of us started to fall behind in the 12 glass wine pairing, the sommelier started to pour less, and charged us proportionately less. The dishes I loved the most were dishes that paired together interesting and contrasting tastes but were not overly fussed with. For example, the first course called croquette was a small croquette with cream and a garnish of steelhead roe. I wasn impressed with the idea of a croquette, but when you pop it into your mouth, the crunchy crust quickly gives way to an unexpectedly tender, creamy interior, shortly before the luscious oily roe pops over it all. A good start.Our second course was called octopus and consisted of a thin slice of octopus stacked with shiso flowers and papaya. A small bowl of broth made from soy beans accompanied it. The combination of flavors and textures was delicious, and the broth chaser complemented the octopus well.The dishes that I did not love, and even disliked, usually involved ingredients that were overly processed to the point where the attempt to extract the essence of the flavor resulted more often in ill tasting artificialness. It was like you were eating a purple grape flavored candy as opposed to a fresh grape. The worst dish representing this was a dish called short rib, which included Guinness beer, peanuts and fried broccoli. Now, I absolutely adore short ribs and beer, so how could anyone mess this up? Here how. The chunk of short rib sat under a translucent, square thin gelatin sheet, presumably made of the Guinness. Bits of peanut and burned broccoli were scattered about the dish, along with mustard seeds. What I love about beer is that refreshing, hoppy, cool liquid taste sliding down your throat, perhaps cleansing away the fatty short ribs you just ate. Now take away the liquid, refreshing, tasty aspects of beer, and what youe got left is that gelatin sheet. The short rib lacked its usual rich, fatty, chewy texture and more resembled stewed meat. Even the mustard seeds and burned broccoli had a monotonous, bitter taste. Not all the dishes need to be great, but none of the dishes should be...bad.A disappointing surprise was that many of the dishes were over salted, killing whatever flavor was underneath. For example, in a dish called hot potato, the warmth of the hot potato released the mouth watering aroma of a black truffle slice and contrasted nicely with the chill of a cold cream potato soup, but the whole dish was marred by the extreme saltiness of the soup. At first, we thought this was a fluke, but several dishes had the same problem. On the plus side, all the meats, from the delicate seafood to the venison, were cooked perfectly. Also, careful attention was paid to the texture of each element in the dishes, a dimension I find is often ignored in many restaurants. Achatztechniques show their strength in the desserts. Almost a third of the courses could be considered desserts, which is more than I would have liked, but they all had interesting combination of tastes that worked well with each other. I loved the bubble encapsulating sweet ginger liquid in one of the desserts, and I also loved the subtly flavored cube of shaved ice that contrasted with the creaminess of horchata pudding in another dessert.The wines we drank (One 12 glass wine pairing plus 2 bottles) were all good, though not remarkable. The sommelier hinted as much when he mentioned that the wine was selected to complement the food, not dominate it. Like the touristy dorks we are, we asked for Grant Achatzautograph on our souvenir menu. He graciously complied for all four of us: Thank You, Grant. Our total worked out to be $1200 before tip. Youe welcome.', 'AlineaI went with the tour menu. Due to the 24 courses, I won write a bunch of comments about each, but rather primarily rank the dishes and mention the highlights for each dish. I prioritized the dished by a 1 (dishes I loved), 2 (dishes I thought were good) ,or 3 (dishes that I didn care for). I had 11 #1s, 8 #2s, and 5 #3s. The pictures really do more justice for this place than my written review. To sum up this dinner, Il say the same thing I told one of the sommeliers, Thank Grant parents for having sex.#8 CroquetteCheese filled and one of the first times I thought salmon roe actually complimented a dish, rather than overwhelm it with salt.#19 OctopusThey hand this dish to you so I forgot to take a picture of it before I ate it. A well prepared dish.#1ChanterelleThe presentation on this one was cool. It comes on the plate within a cylinder. Then, they pull the cylinder and the dish pours out on the plate. The flavor on the mushroom cream propelled this one to the top.#16 AppleFresh flavors of apple and celery. Cool interlude between dishes.#15 MonkfishThe monkfish was presented three ways: fried, grilled, and pate. Very good, but too normal for Alinea.#12 DuckThey bring this one out on a pillow that is filled with juniper air and then puncture it, so there is this aroma of juniper. Pretty cool. The dish itself was good, but not memorable.#7 Black truffleOne of the best tasting dishes I had. He knows how to use truffles. The serving dish was cool because it had an opening in the bottom. #6 Short ribOne of the best presented dishes I had, next to the coconut. Layered with Guinness (beer) gel, it looked liked a piece of art and tasted great. I could have done without the peanuts. The rating was more for the presentation.#20 Yuzu Nothing special to me, but the flavor was good. It was a yuzu flavored with saffron and sprinkled with powdered sugar.#10 ChestnutI love maple so it may be my bias. The chestnut base had a good flavor too.#11 PersimmonTwo things stood out on this one. The ginger liquid filled ball, it explosive and I liked it. The brioche pudding was the star of this dish, very rich. I could bathe in this stuff.#14 Licorice cakeIt was a chocolate-licorice cake and it was well-executed, I could have done without the hay on the top. You are supposed to put the whole thing in your mouth without the use of your hands. I think women could learn a lot from this dish. #22 King crabNot for me. I didn care for the gel around the crab and the rice on the side looked nice, nothing special on the flavor.#24 SkateRumor has it; the chef calls this one, Master of the Universe. I forgot to asked why they served it with bananas, it was odd to me. And way too much powder on the plate. It was the only dish that I thought didn work. None of the flavors went together.#21 PinappleLike the yuzu, it was good, but nothing special. #4 LambOne of my favorite for the presentation and the quality of the lamb. I would consider it a simple dish, each lamb piece with a different sauce, but it was near perfect. I also liked the change to chopsticks. It was served on this hot coal that seared the bottom of the lamb. That hot.#5 Hot potatoOne of his signature dishes and for good reason. It a warm potato ball in a cold soup with truffles. You pull the pin out and the potato falls in the soup. Again, the presentation and the truffles make the dish.#18 VenisonJust way too much granola for the venison. Once you take the granola off, the meat goes well with the accompanying sauces.#13 Foie grasThis was the chef complimentary dish. I just liked the fact that I could get foie gras in Chicago. It was a foie gras mouse encased in cinnamon bun dough. Sweet goes with foie gras and it worked well. #2 OrangeI certain there is cocaine in this dish. It the one I still crave today. That olive oil ice cream is something Ben or Jerry should look into to. Looking around a lot of other people seems to like this dish, also.#3 CoconutIl remember this one for some time. It had the best presentation of the evening. The coconut ribbon across the middle reminded of the 60s when brides use to wear white to weddings, I miss that color. Taste wise, the cornmeal cake was the star.#17 Chocolate - passionfruit, kaffir lime leaf, soyNot sure if it was the wine kicking in at the time, but I stared at the chocolate for a few minutes. Like in that one Seinfeld episode when Elaine stop having sex and she was starring at the tires go ound and ound. I just thought it was cool how they coiled the chocolate. #9 CaramelIt came wrapped around a cinnamon stick, crisp on the outside and a rich, juicy bite of caramel on the inside. Great dish.#23 BaconIt just bacon with a strip of butterscotch. I would take this one off the menu.', ate at Alinea last year, at one year anniversary. of course everything was great, sometimes even tasty. the whole science and food thing is weird to me, but Alinea is great for chicago and for that i will respectfully cast each of the available 5 stars. but i would rather eat at blackbird, trotter, or hot doug's., If you're a foodie and have the spare cash -- and especially if you already live here in Chicago -- then it would be an enormous mistake to never visit Alinea. It is absolutely everything that the critics say: Innovative, creative, thoughtfully prepared food with some of the best service you will see and a calm sparse, New York-chic setting. The way the food is presented beats some of the art I've seen in galleries around here. It's often a shame that it must be eaten. That was only literally the case on one course that I had there the other night: the beef course was incredibly salty and lifeless and the Guinness glace/gel only added to the saltiness. For one of the main course tastes, it was very disappointing. The others were fine, but compared to -- as an example -- Charlie Trotter's, I found myself wanting more flavor and less artifice in a few of the courses. The bacon on the trapeze, though? Genius. I realize the menu changes (and this was on as of March 2007), but I hope it's a permanent fixture.I thought the wine pairing was well worth it and the sommeliers were obviously very knowledgeable, and I appreciated that while they (and the other service) was solicitous, it was not stuffy. In fact, I've never heard so many random pop culture references made at a table at a formal restaurant. The servers and sommeliers in fact, appeared to be hipsters (who happen to know a lot about food and wine).I'm not sure I'd return any time too soon (for one thing, I'm now broke!), but as I said from the start, it is ranked as one of the top restaurants in the entire country, and if you're interested in innovative cuisine, you really should try it at least once., Alinea is a one in a lifetime experience, worth exploring. If you have one meal on earth, let it be the tour.Alinea is a distinguished restaurant with minimalistic charm, the facade is understated, but as you walk through the front door, down a long corridor to doors that slide open, you are greeted by a smiling host/hostess. Without a reservation, don't expect to be seated. And make your reservation well in advance, they typically book up to two months ahead. Alinea offers two menus, the tasting (12 courses) and the tour (24 courses). Both menus can be paired with wine by their master sommelier, Scott.Each course is innovative, inventive, spectacular and unbelievably arranged and presented. The inventive techniques applied, from creating foam, pureeing vegetables, grilling meat on hot stones and freezing with liquid nitrogen. From the gentle presentation, the unprententious atmosphere, to the exquisite timing, Alinea is the epitome of dining excellence. Never did I wonder about a nuance of my experience, anticipation of my desires were satiated., My girlfriend Chris and I went to Alinea in December. We did the tour and wine pairing. Our Sommelier Justin added some White Burgundy to our wines since it's my favorite. The experience was incredible and I was on an Alinea buzz for days after. The $840 check was worth it and I hope to do it again this spring or summer. My experience at Alinea far exceeded my experience at the French Laundry in California., 'An earlier reviewer said his girlfriend said eating there was like having sex in her mouth. I felt like I had sex too, but I felt that it was only after I had bent over. Perhaps the staff of Alinea has been helping the reviews of this over rated restaurant. When I am spending $500 for dinner, call me silly, but I actually prefer service that is friendly in clean uniforms. And a sommelier that is over 22. None of that was the case on my recent visit to Alinea. The food and presentation was top notch. Truly a great adventure and done very well However, the staff was surly, the uniforms were dirty and torn and the sommelier looked like he was still in college. BTW, when I called to Alinea to ask if there was always a sommelier on staff, they said yes. When I got there, there was not. As someone who has a fairly good grasp on wines, his recommendations were strictly aimed at increasing my check, not to complement my food.   For the price, I would go elsewhere. Period.', 'Simply put: the service and food were so amazing at Alinea I didn minding dropping $500 on the extended menu with wine pairing. Ie never said that before (and I will probably never say it again). Alinea is definitely a culinary experience and not just eating out. They even made some special new dishes just for my wife because she was a vegetarian.All in all, if you can afford it, you should make it a point to visit Alinea. I would say that you can probably just do the shorter menu and still have a great experience but like I said already, I have no regrets about going all the way!', It's been said before, and it will be said again, dinner at Alinea was the best dining experience of my life. While I didn't love everything I put in my mouth, every dish was a culinary adventure that I will not soon forget. The atmosphere at Alinea is simple and calming, but dare I say, the best part about Alinea was the absolutely impeccable service by the friendly, charming, down to earth waiters. There are neither enough stars nor enough dollar signs to describe Alinea, and anyone who has the opportunity to indulge themselves here should.Thanks Mom!, The high concept culinary experience that Alinea provides is almost indescribable. At first entry to the hidden, unmarked building, doors slide open and give diners the feeling that they are walking into the future. Chef Grant Achatz spent years at Napa's famous French Laundry and has elevated the level of innovative cooking at his Chicago eatery to that of pure science and elegance.Food is presented in the most creative ways (a slice of bacon on a wire, a potato and truffle on a pin) thanks to Crucial Detail Design Studio (crucialdetail.com). Service is impeccable, with waiters wearing fine suits and having superb knowledge of daily offerings.The twelve course tasting menu paired with their suggested wines adds to the whole dining experience and the Spanish Verdejo was the standout., 'An experience unlike any other, unfortunately with the price to match. Unique dishes, flavors, presentations, aromas, wine pairings, and everything combine to be probably the most memorable meal you will have. Too much goodness to even give it justice by trying to describe here.', Alinea specializes in molecular gastronomy. If you don't know what that is think, food, performance art, and science. Confused... great keep it that way. I was planning on posting all the details about the meal, but honestly it's better to try it yourself.The price is not cheap but the experience is quite unlike anything you have ever tried (unless you've been to a molecular gastronomy place before).If your curiosity is piqued and money is no object then make that reservation right now.Now for those of you who insist upon a course-by-course review go to: tangmeister.com/alinea (complete with long-winded pretentious comments). The one saving grace is all the pretty pictures., 'Having read soooo much hype about this place I went in almost looking to be disappointed...it didn happen. Not even a little.The thing is, you HAVE to go in knowing that youe about to drop a SERIOUS chunk of change (though, even with this understanding, the sticker shock is pretty mean). My friend and I decided to partake in the whole experience offered for our 12 course selection, including the champagne cocktail at the beginning of the meal, the wine pairings with the courses and the unbelievably good coffee at the end. Everything, including tip, for the two of us totaled $630. Yeah, I know.But, kinda like I described in my review of Tru, this is not JUST dining out, it an experience in and of itself. I am not a foodie, I am not artsy. But I do like to go into things in full disclosure and with an open mind. What I came out with was what was so unexpected: I was completely inspired. In each course, the combination of flavors from ingredients I am already familiar with was astounding. Things that I never would have dreamed of going well together worked so harmoniously, never in a shocking manner, but always surprising. Clearly, the chef knowledge of all ingredients - how they can be prepared in such a way to best compliment one another, how they taste at different stages of natural maturity, their textures, - is deep and, again, astounding.One of my favorite eating experiences is to consume a dish where I am chasing the flavors: ooh, I got just got a bite of sweet that works beautifully with all this savory...where another bit... These are the meals where, before you know it, youe stuffed but still want more. 12 of the 13 courses I had were like this...without the stuffed part.So, the place: Very modern, intimate, lots of clean lines and thoughtful details (the cloth towels in the bathroom - single-serve, no attendant, thank you; the tasteful covers on the HVAC vents in the ceiling; funky and unusual floral arrangements, comfortable chairs). Aside from the fact that, when we walked in through the sliding metal doors, there was no host stand or anyone to greet us for a few minutes so we weren sure what we were supposed to do, the staff was amazing. I can only assume that each server is briefed on only a few of the dishes in the series and, when this dish is to be served at any of the tables, they are the guy to do it throughout the restaurant: we had at least 6 different people explain different things to us as they were brought. It also didn hurt that (especially for a irl night there were so many cute guys: well-groomed, artsy-types in very nice suits. And the sommelier...hubba hubba.I have a whole description of each course but, alas, it won fit here.I found myself wondering what I ever did to get the opportunity to have this experience. Thanks E & D!!!!', Wow! Second best restaurant I have ever dined at.This was the third attempt at dining at Alinea. Our first two had to be cancelled due to last minute work conflicts. So when the event finally came, we were stoked.Be warned, there is no sign that we could see. We drove past the place twice without finding it. Finally we saw the valet sign and voila, we were in! The entrance is a little spooky. It is a dark corridor that tapers narrower the deeper in you go. We crept our way through the dark to the end and a sliding door a la Star Trek silently opened beside us and an immaculately dressed man greeted us warmly. Very spooky indeed. We were immediately let upstairs to our gigantic table for two in a sparsely decorated room that could be on the cover of Wallpaper magazine. The main decoration were these space age lillies in glass vases with the Japanese rock embellishments. The colors were all soothing browns and mauves to tone down the off white linens. And guess what? The linens were actually MADE OUT OF LINEN! Not cotton, not silk, not satin, but LINEN. What a nice touch.There was nothing but the linens adorning the table. The wine menu was like a work of bloody Russian realist ficiton, with 600 or more protaganists, all of them larger than life itself (most north of $80 per bottle). I was a little too peckish and thirsty to read part one of War and Peace so we just ordered what the Sommelier suggested - a champagne cocktail made by mixing a boutique Champagne with just a smidge of sweet dessert wine. Delicious. The Sommelier pushed the wine pairings option, which he describes as painstakingly matched to each course, and rather than making a Tolstoyan effort at the wine list I decided to submit to our Sommelier's will.The meal: 14 courses, all small, many bite-sized, but in whole just a little too much food (which to me is the perfect amount)Every dish was both a work of Art, and a work of Science - in particular, a work of Chemistry. From the octopus nestled in a pillow of papaya with a spoon for a bed, suspended above a bowl of warmed, coconut-infused soy milk , to the black truffle juice someow stuffed to tightly into a ravioli that it literally explodes into your mouth when you bite it (if you are not careful you spew it all over your date) -- this meal is the yin and yang of dining. Most of the courses are really beyond description, and many of the flavor combinations I have never seen before - think bacon with butterscotch; brie or avocado ice-cream; chocolate and lemongrass; apple and horseradish -- get the picture? The amazing thing is, it all works. Plus every course has a science gimmick -- such as your plate sitting on a pillow that has been filled with lavender scented air so that as you eat the weight of the pillow pushes the air out for you to smell with your food; or a licorice cake that is somehow perfectly skewered on a flexible metal rod that somehow suspends just before your cake-hole, so that you can just stick your face into it and have at it, reminding you of the good old caveman days before knives and forks; or like the magical chocolate ball that sat innocently in its bowl until the waiter poured hot white chocolate milk onto it and the top half (AND ONLY THE TOP HALF) of the ball melted away, revealing a cross-section of outer chocolate crust, a molten white chocolate lava mantle, and a chocolate brownie core. How the hell do they DO these things???Service was almost on the casual side, as the jocular waiters encouraged us to chow down on the licorice cake, and use our fingers to rip into the bacon and butterscotch, but at that place it works. The Sommelier did not dissapoint - the parings were indeed perfectly matched. But that brings me to why I don't like wine pairings. There are always a bubbly course, two to three white wine courses, two red wine courses and one or two sweet wine courses. Well, call me caveman, but I generally would rather have like eight bubbly courses or maybe eight red courses, or maybe four and four. I don't like sweet wine much, and some white wines I just find boring. So next time I will skip the pairing and instead I'll just get mediaeval on the 600 bottle wine list. Finally, I wish there was some kind of music, even if it was almost imperceptable music. A piano, a string section, something. The restaurant was packed but it was so quiet you could hear the waiters at the other tables, and you could hear everyone else's conversations. So it made us self-conscious of our conversations. If I'm going to drop $600 for two people for dinner, I don't want to feel embarrassed when I get loosened up and start telling my date about my Joan Jett fetish...Other nice touches -- replacing the LINEN napkin with a new one every time you go to the rest room, a different type of bread with each course, custom made dinnerware designed around each course, and at the end they bring you the printed menu for a keepsake. A+, This is the best restaurant in Chicago! The food is excellent-- innovative and beautifully presented. They also have some fantastic, very rare wines. I definitely recommend doing the wine pairings. Expensive, but worth it. It's a truly unique experience., Incredible, but be prepared for a test of your culinary endurance. I went when I first moved to Chicago, as some friends came to help me move in (although only after they secured reservations at Alinea).We had 9:30PM reservations, and although I expected the 20+ courses, I had no clue we would be there until 1:30AM. I nearly passed out at 11:30 around the 15th course, but a succulent veal course revitalized me. Upon rereading my friend's blog, it was the pork cheek that woke me up The menu is also really neat, and I enjoyed a great apertif recommended by the server.The service is impeccable. Throughout the entire four hour meal, it truly felt like we had our personal wait staff team of three.You can view photos (and read my friend's recap) of my meal here: foodite.com/foodite/200643_, 'I dined at Alinea a year ago for my birthday. Best birthday meal ever.Swank, sophisticated, pretentious. Brilliantly innovative, creative, gorgeous. Outstanding food. Tops Bouley, in my opinion, in both palate and presentation. And god, the presentation. Bison on a hot rock nestled in a bed of juniper branches? Mace scented pillows on which to balance your duck and foie gras? Genius. More than genius. Chef/owner Grant Achatz is a culinary savant. From the opening dish, Hot Potato (a cold potato soup served in a half-dollar sized paraffin bowl skewered with potato and black truffle) to the finish, the menu was simply superb. There were a few standouts: the salsify with smoked salmon and steelhead roe; pork with honeycomb, grapefruit and puffed pork thigh; kobe beef topped with roasted squash seeds and paprika candy. I actually shut down my extraneous senses when I tasted the duck with foie gras, quince and onion-closed my eyes and tuned everyone out. I will never forget that foie gras, ever. Sigh.The beauty of Alinea is that there is a high degree of fun hidden in all the pomp. Ice cream in Achatz world comes in a single bite set on a the gastronomic equivalent of a radio antenna, and the hovering waitstaff insist you eat it witout using your hands. A complimentary shot glass of green liquid with what looks to be an egg yolk is set before each diner. Enquiry (or patience) reveals the liquid is a celery-base, the yellow globe a shell of madras curry; shoot it, close your mouth quickly to collapse the shell, and enjoy the ensuing burst of deliciousness. Get the sommelier with the goatee. He a punk-rock oenophile. How can you go wrong?The only problem, at least when I went a year ago, was that it was far too quiet. My group of five in a side room apparently chased away a few couples who got tired of our celebratory mood. It also is rather uncomfortable to have personal conversations with a multitude of staff in attendance at all times. Ie worked in personal service. I can never fully ignore the presence of servicepeople, so you either self-censor or give everybody the 411 on your business.Eh. I can live with that for another taste of that foie, though!', A restaurant from the future.From the elaborate entrance, to the way the kitchen is so quiet and well organized you'd think it was an advertisement come to life but when you see and taste the food, you'll be blown away. Various ways of eating things and tasting things in ways you'd think might never be acceptable considering how you're dressed.Downside: It will be hard to go back to eating regular food after experiencing so many sensations with your tongue., 'I recently had two friends in from the Sonoma/Napa area of California. They came to visit the city and specifically eat at Alinea. They asked that I attend with them as a treat for my birthday. Quite the treat indeed. First of all the couple had met the chef in the past and also new someone else connected to the restaurant.... which led us to having a special 27 course meal ....along with wine pairings. Needless to say, this was one of the most amazing dining experiences of my lifetime. 27 courses and 5 1/2 hours later our dinner was complete with a look of amazement on all of our faces. The food, the inventiveness, the service.... all outstanding. I agree with another yelper.... multiple foodgasms happened that night. I cannot recommend Alinea enough. My favorite courses: Monkfish done 3 ways. Wagyu beef (and I thought Kobe was amazing) with yuzu, seaweed smoke and sea grapes. Cheese in a cracker. Rhubarb done 6 ways. Hot potato, cold potato wit black truffle and butter. Foie Gras with spicy cinnamon, apple pate de fruit..... the list can go on and on. Plus an amazing combination of Italian, French and German wines that made me giddy. To top off the evening..... going into the kitchen to see the amazing staff of chefs and meeting head chef Grant. WOW on every level. Thanks again to my friends, I cannot thank you enough', Jesus... WOW! This place is absolutely amazing... a feast for all of the senses. This really shouldn't be thought of as just a restaurant, but some sort of sensory experience. I won't soon forget this place. Everything has already been said...the chef is a genius and everyone I had contact with, is beyond superb. I love the minimalist decor which accentuates the food so well and strangely enough, I think the absence of music (at least I didn't hear any), works very well. Art meets science meets food....FABULOUS!, Recently ate here on a trip to Chicago and would definitely recommend it to anyone serious about food. The tour could be shortened by 4 courses - a bit of palette overload going on. It's nowhere near the quality of French Laundry or Fat Duck (I've seen comparisons to both), but it is good. It is a bit pricey for what it is and I'm being really honest here. I have no issues paying $500-1000 for dinner per person if it's worthwhile. This, was not. The wine pairing for the tour was a bit too much.Luckily our table was in the smaller back room -- I say luckily because the other dining areas looked, well, not as cool.Oh and the sommelier is one seriously opinionated person! Question any of his judgments or really really snide comments and it's like World War III. Overall his picks were solid, but he could do without the slanted commentary., Warning: The following review is TRUNCATED and better revisited at my blog for full pictures and commentary =PFive stars for innovation, though some flavors are less accessible to the palate than othersAlinea can best be described as a series of carefully orchestrated surprises for each of your five senses. While the 12-course tasting menu will set you back $135 and a good four hours, it is unlike any culinary experience I've had yet.It may seem counterintuitive, but the best way to experience Alinea is without expectations. Yes, you've read the hype and you've heard the buzz about molecular gastronomy--but you've never had bacon for a palate cleanser and you've never dreamed of adding soy sauce to your dessert. So when you hear adjectives such as good, orgasmic, or weird, you're really only hearing expletives that are void of meaning. Because unless you've been intimately acquainted with the likes of Homaro Cantu, Heston Blumenthal, Wylie Dufresne, or Ferran Adria, you will really have no baseline with which to compare Alinea to.COURSE HiGHLIGHTSCourse 3: Monkfish - banana, onion, lime // Cauliflower. Our only other seafood dish was Monkfish (vegetarian Cauliflower), prepared in a mousse, tempura, and steamed with banana and lime sauces and garnished with an onion paper. Above all, this was a lesson in texture with the creamy mousse, crunchy tempura, and silky monkfish. The banana and lime sauces cooled the dish, while the onion paper dissolved swiftly in our mouths.Like any good lover, Achatz means only to give you a taste of what he's got in store for the rest of night. Our first four courses were merely child's play--dishes that were fathomable and gently teased us into oral foreplay. So just when we were starting to get bored...Course 5: Apple - horseradish, celery. We were told to throw back the shots and to open our mouths wide to take in the entire ball at once. Once inside, there was a cytoplasmic explosion of apple juice. It was strangely pleasant and slightly erotic all at once. Paying careful attention to the progression, this first eruption was gentle, easing us into the experience. Once the liquid went down, we were left with the essence of horseradish but with only a hint of its heat.The remainder of our savory courses paid homage to the regional cuisine with a Midwest-lean towards rich, protein heavy dishes. Course 6: Duck - mango, yogurt, pillow of lavender air // Turnip. The Duck (vegetarian Turnips) was prepared in a manner befitting of pork with duck rinds, duck bacon, and pulled duck. As with the other fruit sauces, the essence of mango really shone through and for added pizazz, the whole plate was set atop a pillow of lavender air, which diffused directly into our olfactory systems.Course 8: Black Truffle - explosion, romaine, parmesan. Though it came sans meat, the Black Truffle ravioli was no less rich. Although benign looking, the pasta membrane actually housed a robust, truffle scented broth that exploded upon contact. The single ravioli captured the soul of an entire pasta dish and would have sated any craving for Italian, no matter how small or large.Course 10: Bacon - butterscotch, apple, thyme. Our prayers were answered when an interlude came announcing the arrival of dessert. While the vegetarians got a Honeydew jelly to cleanse their palates, we were served dehydrated Bacon. With the OC Fair currently in tow, it was a stone's throw away from a caramel apple. Served on a rocking apparatus, it was highly whimsical and an inventive way to bridge the salty to sweet transition.Our last and final dish was Course 14: Caramel - meyer lemon, cinnamon perfume. I will never understand how you tempura a viscous caramel and lemon, but the taste of churro sent me yearning for home. How many licks do you think it take to get to a center of a caramel tempura ball the size of a golf-ball? Alinea's answer is one.The staff read our minds (or eavesdropped on our conversation) and asked us if we wanted to see the kitchen at the stroke of midnight when our meal ended. The kitchen was starting to wind down, which gave Chef Chad a chance to explain to us the wax molds he was working on. No sign of Grant Achatz, but Chad was good enough eye candy for me.In closing, Alinea is not about what you do or don't like. It is about the appreciation of an unnamed sensation, a flavor that leaves you at a loss for words, and a culinary innovation that is only beginning to take flight in the United States. It is the technology of the early adopter and the beta version of a cuisine that is not yet commercially viable.Some art forms are more accessible to the intellect--others, just need to be studied to be appreciated. Alinea 100 - Introduction to Molecular Gastronomy, check., 'I really can top Monica T. review on the food, so I going to review their valet. I drove my car up to the valet area in front of Alinea. (The only way youl know youe at Alinea is when you see the valet sign. ) Initially I think they thought I was lost, because they didn come up to valet my fancy Ford Focus rental car. I had to wave at them and they came over. So I got out and watched them drive the car away.So while I was waiting outside for Monica T., Jun H. and their friend, the valet was nice enough to point out that they found a street parking spot for my car, so they wouldn charge me for valet service. My jaw almost dropped to the floor. Really?!?! I asked as he handed me back the car keys. That was awfully nice of you! And then I tried to give him a tip, and he refused politely. Never before had I experienced someone being so kind to find me a parking spot and refuse a tip! Perhaps it the astounding attention to service at Alinea or Midwestern kindess, but I would love it if more people were like Alinea valet staff. :)', SpeechlessThat and in tearsThat was how my daughter and I were both left after spending several hours at Alinea...it lives up to the hype and then some. It soared beyond the rating of Gourmet, it really is in a class of its own.You will have to know where you are going, because this little house on Halsted that holds this gem of a restaurant isn't marked. And be prepared to enter an Alice in Wonderland sort of adventure, because you open the door and you feel like you're descending into a tunnel. Doors whisper open and there is the host waiting for you...very surrealWe felt SO out of place, SO out of our league...like what the freak were WE doing there, in this incredible place? Was this really happening? The menu was specially prepared for us as we're not seafood eaters, I am allergic and my pastry chef daughter isn't all that adventurous (she is now after this menu!) so we were delighted with all sorts of different entrees, cleverly plated and just bursting into our mouths.Two writers from Cooks Illustrated sat next to us, they were enjoying the Tour, while we only had the Tasting (we had 15 courses instead of the usual 12...I think that may have been because of the birthday celebration). We watched as they listened intently as each more intricate dish than the last was brought out and we laughed at the expressions on their faces. They returned the favor as they enjoyed US experiencing our delightful dinner.My favorite still is this miraculous hot potato/cold potato...I can still see the tiniest of cheese and miniature cube of butter, and I can still taste all of those tiny ingredients melding together into a mouthful of exquisite potato flavors...earthly, with the shaved truffle, creamy with the cold soup...just beyond description!We were delighted with each plating, even the lavendar air pillow that was served with the duck...it was an all senses experience to be sure.The caramal/meyer lemon/cinnamon show stopper at the end...brought tears to my eyes...I wanted several more of those, the favors were still in my mouth as we were getting ready to leaveBecause my daughter is in the industry, we asked if we could see the kitchen, possibly meet Grant or the Chef de Cuisine. On a very, very sad note, due to Grant's recent diagnosis with mouth cancer, he was in treatment and did not speak to anyone. We said that was totally understandable, to be able to see the kitchen was an honor enoughWe went downstairs and waited and we were shown into the kitchen, and my daughter was awestruck by the 20 chefs preparing all sorts of tiny, amuse bouche sized 'entrees'. We watched in awe as they delicately prepared the hot potato/cold potato entree and were just speechless.I honestly don't know what we said after Grant Achatz walked up and shook our hands. He sidestepped my question about how he was feeling, and was very attentive to my daughter after he found out who she worked for...she was nearly in tears by the time we walked out the front door.Run, don't walk...fly on the fastest plane, do whatever you can to get here before its too late...and let's all pray there's a cure for cancer...STAT!, alinea. oh, how i love you. i was awestruck from the moment i walked in. the food, the food. each course was a surprise, an explosion of flavors, a little piece of happiness. i kept the menu. i'm thinking of framing it., What can I say, it's been over 6 months since I've been to Alinea, and I'm still not sure what I think of the place. I know I want to go back, but that's more out of curiousity than because I really liked their food.Don't get me wrong, there were some fantastic dishes to be had at Alinea. In particular we really liked the Sour Cream, Melon, Finger Limes, Pineapple and Strawberries. But there were also some real duds.Duds. There's an interesting word. When I use it to describe Alinea's food, it's not because the food lacked flavor. On the contrary, I'd say that certain dishes contained too much flavor. Or at least too much of one flavor that the dish seemed imbalanced and over powered by items that were supposed to play a supporting role. One of the first dishes that springs to mind is the Broccoli Stem. This was a disappointing dish because I had been looking forward to it after reading about it online. The grapefruit in this dish and the steelhead roe just completely masked this poor broccoli to the point that you could have put almost any vegetable in there without making much of a difference.Then there were dishes like the Porcini that tasted like nothing but pureed sunflower seeds. Oddly, since the porcini flavor is similarly earthy and nutty, it was just a muddled mass of goo in my mouth. I think this was the only dish I didn't finish.Other dishes were just disappointing because, as creative as they were, they just actually didn't go far enough. The Beef (flavors of A-1) had all of these little flavors to try with your beef, but they didn't give you enough ink in your well to truly experiment with the canvas they gave you. I actually just rolled mine all up to combine all of the flavors and didn't bother trying to mix-n-match in what appeared to be a futile exercise.I realize that I've focused almost exclusively on the negatives here, but that's because I figured there is enough praise and drooling on the eGullet forums that I should give a counter point.Don't get me wrong, I can certainly understand what people are raving about and I really do think Chef G is an important figure in the American culinary scene. I think his influences will be felt for years to come, especially as he becomes more established and more of a household name among non-foodies.Regardless, even after months of reflecting on our meal, it just doesn't change the fact that we walked away disappointed. Some have been criticized for going without having an open mind or they just don't understand the cuisine or numerous other silly knocks. I can confidently say that I went with an open mind knowing fully what to expect, but the food, or more specifically the flavors, just didn't seem like anyone tasted them before putting it on an antennae and sticking in front of me.This got me thinking about the experience of dining. An interesting thing about dining, is that a single dish isn't going to make or break a meal. The experience as a whole is what people will remember when they decide if they like a restaurant. A particular dish is what people will remember when they decide if they like a particular flavor profile. A great example of this is The French Laundry. Aside from the Oysters & Pearls, I can't say there were a lot of dishes that really stand out in my mind, yet it was one of the best meals I've had in my life. In contrast, I remember quite vividly several dishes from Alinea, both good and bad, yet it was probably our least favorite meal of our entire Chicago trip (Ann Sather being the other).So no, I didn't enjoy our meal there. Yes, I would encourage others to go. Yes, I enjoyed the challenge. And yes, I'm looking forward to returning. Weird, I know.Read the rest of this and my other Chicago restaurant reviews on gastronomic Fight Club:gastronomicfightclub.com43_, 'If I could give 10 stars, Alinea would get them all.Ate there two nights ago and am still completely awestruck. All other food seems like slop now. Im completely ruined!!!Took pics and/or video of every course (lots of action on the plate there!). If youe interested, theye at picasaweb.google.com/dia43_.', Before I actually went to this place, I had hesitations that maybe this food wouldn't be super great but just super gimmicky. After going to this place, I can tell you that all the strange stuff you hear about isn't gimmicky at all. Everything that's done to food at Alinea is done to make it taste better. I loved my dinner here., Thank god I wasn't paying for this one!If you want a crazy dining experience and have the patience to sit through four hours of dining, then please check this place out. But honestly, they are just too full of themselves here. I didn't want to talk as I was afraid I would disrupt the cathedral to food. The wine pairing was outrageously expensive considering most wines came from Serbia. The food was certainly an adventure and an experience I'm glad I had. I particularly liked the six shot glasses full of vegetable extracts that were lined up in front of us. The deep fried pork belly hanging on a wire was also intriguing., 'Okay, so if youe like me, a petite Asian female and on a weight-loss plan for the past year where you now eat 4-6 small meals per day, even having the 12-course tasting with the wine pairing is an absolute challenge. In our case, it was more like 15 courses. By the time we had our last savory course (the bacon hanging on a wire), I was ready to fall asleep/keel over. I would go to Alinea again, but probably opt for no more than two glasses of wine (one red and one white) and stick with the 12-course tasting menu. Ie read on other blogs that the 24-course meal has smaller portions, but that didn appear to be the case when I was there. There were two tables (one party of two and a larger party of six) that were going the tour and I just marveled at how they could even handle it.I was more impressed with the savory courses than the sweet/dessert courses. The presentation of all the courses was beautiful and surprising (although not too surprising since I read a lot about what to expect from various foodie blogs) and the service was excellent. I honestly could have ended the meal with the palate cleanser (guava). Of the savory courses, the one that left me confused was the lamb course. I think that it should have been named English pea since this was the predominant ingredient/flavor for me. But do take my comments with a grain of salt, so to speak...I was quite toasty by the 12th course. Maybe if I weren so drunk, I have a different opinion of the sweet courses.This was definitely the most expensive meal wee ever had ($500+ for two--that the tasting menu plus wine pairings, tip and tax). We were there for at least 3.5 hours.', We had an amazing experience here. Everybody else has talked about the food (which was AWESOME), so I'll say a few things about the staff.We had a great time with the 10+ people we had serving us throughout our dining experience. We certainly didn't experience any pretentiousness during our dinner. Even when service errors were made (one of the items was spilled on the table) it was recovered with a smile and a joke. I thought that was great. Instead of focus on the mistake, we were challenged to try and serve the pieces ourselves. We also elected to order two bottles of wine instead of the wine pairing and went on the recommendations of the wine director for a Viognier and a Grenache. Outside of the pairing these wines complemented our tasting experience quite well (with some dishes certainly better than others). Overall, this was a tremendous dining experience and I look forward to having an excuse (and the spare cash) to go again., 'Amazing. Innovative and fun!The service was impeccable. At the end of the night, they offered me a pashmina wrap when I was feeling chilly! I really enjoyed the down to earth attitude of the waitstaff. Ie been to all the other top restaurants in Chicago, and received the best service here by far.The food was great- very different. I felt quite full once we got to the 17th course, but luckily my date finished it for me! The wine offering is extensive as well. We had a 1988 Echezeaux and a 2003 Puligny-Montrachet Cru which was AMAZING.I loved the atmosphere too. Very Inspector Gadget. If you have VIP clients to entertain, or something big to celebrate, I highly recommend!', Black Truffles...drooling still. I cannot even express or find enough words to decribe how delicous Alinea was. I would be happy to eat scraps that fell on the floor! I am not one for the upscale -sitdown for a long time- and can't wear my jeans- dining experiance. But if you bring me back here I will do whatever you tell me to do. anything., I still laughed at myself for being a poor girl having a $580 meal by taking the Halsted bus which drops us right in front of the restaurant. :-)Comparing our experience at Tru, Charlie Trotter's and Everest, Alinea really tops it all for their innovative and still tasty food, the all-senses experience, impeccable yet not snobbish service. However, that was also the most expensive meal compared to the other 3. Well worth it!Now that I've had Alinea, I don't know where we should go for our next special meal? Afraid that no restaurant will live up to the standard Alinea has set., 'My wife and I and two friends flew in to Chicago this weekend specifically to eat here. After reading the reviews and hearing about Grant Alchatz tongue cancer, we figured that we should make sure that we ate there soon. It didn disappoint. We did the 12 course tasting menu with wine pairings and over the course of 4 hours had a fantastic meal. My favorites included the wagyu beef covered in pine leaves and the pumpkin pie served skewed on a burnt oak branch, but it was all just a delight. Service was pleasant, informative, always there when needed but in the background the rest of the time.'|3
4|als-place-san-francisco|Just returned from a dinner at Al's Place. Today was their first night and they were excellent. It's a great new place. The food is beautiful and delicious -- vegetarian courses are imaginative and have a lot of protein which is very important. Non-vegetarians will be excited too -- their fish courses are very very good, plus they had a great steak course on the menu. The service was attentive. Al's Place is off to a great start and we wish them extremely well (and will certainly be back)., Al's Place was excellent! For a soft opening, everything went on seamlessly - great service and ambience. It had sort of a beachy vibe to it...must be the combo of the seafood and veggies. The Pasta and Yellow Bean Stew were delicious! Will definitely be back for more. Thumbs up to this great new spot in my neighborhood!, 'Today was the first day the restaurant was opened to the public. The service and food were great. The ingredients are fresh and the dishes are inventive and overall well-executed, definitely worth a visit!We had the yellow eye bean stew and the hog jowls, both were excellent. The stew was complex and flavorful, a great comfort dish on a rainy night. The jowls were sprinkled with seaweed and anchovies - the combination was creative, delicious and melted in your mouth. The chickpeas that was a snack was also good. The curry with cod and grapefruit was OK. The curry was good, but I thought the addition of grapefruit was odd. The renovations also look great - bright, modern and open, definitely an improvement over the previous restaurant that was in the location. The owner/chef Aaron London (thus, AL Place) was the chef at the famed vegetarian Ubuntu restaurant in Napa. AL Place serves some fish and meat dishes as sides, but its heavy emphasis on vegetables (Ubuntu-style food) in a casual and fun environment is somewhat unique to the SF restaurant scene. Love that it is located slightly off the main Valencia corridor.', Wow - very well done to the team at Al's Place. For only being open 3 days you really put on a fun dining experience filled with energetic ambience, cool decor, friendly staff and top notch food. I would describe the food as clean, light, fresh, artistic, adventurous, bold, and unique with very interesting flavor combinations. I must say the EVERYONE should try the trout with potatoes. Mind blowing. I could eat that for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We would recommend this place to all our foodie friends. Really appreciate the high quality of the ingredients. The music was a bazaar mix of tunes but it was playful for a Friday night. Ps... allow up to 15 minutes for parking in this area. (Pps... Rebecca our waitress was a sweetheart)!, SOLID. First week open and if it continues just like it was tonite, it's a done deal. Every dish deelish. Rich and tasty! With that said, I would recommend 3-4 people reservations, to taste a variety and not be over done in the belly ;) The stew is hearty, aromatic and reedunk-a-dunk with the pork jowl. Pork is a side dish, but really could practically be an entree, and not overly salty like it might read. Lightly smoked trout has a silky texture and so perfectly paired with little pillows of potato that are perfectly seasoned. Burrata is yummy with the chips too. Overall, everything is seasoned well and not overly salty, which allows actually more of the nuances of flavor to come through. Kudos to the chef!, 'Me: Umm, why is our cell phone bill over $250?!?!Mr. NSS: Sorry, it data overage.Me: How did you go over... again?!Mr. NSS: .......Me: Well?...Mr. NSS: You know, I can view ertainsites at work.Me: Uh huh...Mr. NSS: Hey, I just looking for tuffwe can watch together.Me: (o_O)Mr. NSS: OK, OK...where do you want to go for dinner?And so, Al Place happened on Saturday night...Just opening the night before, Al Place took over South End Grill. Even before they opened their doors, there was a small line outside so reservations are recommended as I saw some couples being turned away (no Opentable points though--boo!). The chef comes from the beloved Ubuntu, a vegetarian restaurant in wine country. The genius-ly creative menu focus are on vegetables as illustrated in the menu; vegetables are served as main entrees while meats are served as sides: bit.ly/16FWJgn. About 2-3 dishes are recommended per a person and everything is meant to be shared. Surprisingly, everything is under $20 and portions were sizeable (except the fries) aka we didn have to grab a slice of pizza afterwards. I really appreciate this since $35 mini-me entrees followed by second dinners have become a sad reality in SF.There no full bar but there loophole (low proof) cocktails available in addition to beer and wine. If booze ain your thang, they have house-made sodas available: bit.ly/192c6kZ. For cocktails, I tried Mr. Blonde and Mr. Pink but I didn like either of them. To be honest, they were gross; too cloyingly sweet and syrupy. ~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~*French Fries w/ smoked apple sauce ($5) - 4 STARSbit.ly/1z0HhmMI think these fries were brined first (?) then fried because they had a coarser texture. Loved the accompanying apple dipping sauce that was uniquely savory, smoky, and sweet.*Yellow Eye Bean Stew w/ josey baker torn bread ($13) - 5 STARSbit.ly/16KreSHNow this bowl may not look like much but the stew so amazingly delicious. It was hearty with great depths of flavor. The torn, and toasted josey baker bread croutons provided a great texture contrast. *Tonnarelli w/ green garlic, bergamot, botarga ($15) - 5 STARSbit.ly/192b9sWPerfectly al-dente with a toothsome chew, the pasta was blanketed in this lovely green garlic sauce that was rich and creamy. The shavings of botarga gave a nice salty punch. *Jowl ham, seaweed, anchovies ($13) - 5 STARS bit.ly/1DwP29CIf you love pork belly, then this is a must order. It reminds me of a dish I grew up eating: hakka braised pork belly with pickled veggies but a much more refined version, of course. The jowl ham was incredibly tender and melted in my mouth like pork buttah. Do eat it with the seaweed and anchovies as it helps cut through some of the richness. *Hanger Steak w/ crab butter, sherry vinaigrette ($16) - 5 STARS bit.ly/1uvC4adNow, IF this description doesn make you wet, I don know what will. The hanger steak is first seared with brown butter and crab tomalley (innards) before being showered with a crab butter-sherry vinaigrette, our waiter explained to us. Foodgasmic umami BOMB...that is all. *Warm Brownie w/ pb ice cream, payday filling ($7) - 5 STARSbit.ly/16KrHUNAs suggested by our waiter, we dug into the warm, chocolatey brownie from the middle and was welcomed with a oozing caramely peanut center. It was one satisfying dessert in combination with the creamy peanut butter ice cream. I like that it wasn too sweet or rich either; just right. ~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~The staff was most excellent considering we came on the second day of opening. Everyone was really welcoming, friendly, and attentive. Considering they were busy, food service was very timely so they clearly have their sh*t together in the kitchen. Very impressive.~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~Such a change from the dark and drab predecessor, Al Place is now bright with a lot of natural light coming in. It very casual with simple wood furnishings. Recommended for a casual date night but not for very large groups.~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~Bring a lot of patience. Good luck!A very solid grand opening, I think Al Place is going to be the new hot spot in the Mission for its very reasonably priced menu that both creative and deliciously memorable. If all future paid meals can be just as good as this, Mr. NSS can continue looking for tuffwe (he) can watch all he wants....', Al's Place takes a concept that could fall flat-small menu of seafood or vegetarian dishes with meat as an additional course and really makes it work with menu that's more satisfying than many new meat-centric restaurants.TL;DR review-Small menu of interesting and delicious dishes that are understated but delicious served in an equally understated setting.I have to say with such a small menu and a focus on vegetable and seafood this place could very easily not deliver but I was very surprised by how well the dishes worked.The menu is divided into four sections- snacks, Cold dishes, Warm/Hot dishes and Sides. It was suggested that we order one from each section to share and that's just what we did. SNACKS:The snacks had familar trendy flavour vadouvan (ie. dutch curry), fennel and other seasoning. We got the Fritters with fennel sauce , which was three very light freshly fried dough ball that were more like beignet in texture than American fritter. Our order came with 3 fritters, our neighbors had 4. These were perfect delicious little bites.COLD DISH: there were four cold dish several which were vegetarianTrout with kolrabi mousse, potatoes and broth $16-This was a smaller dish than we expected for the price but it was very satisfying with lots of flavour. We asked for some of the Josey Baker bread to soak up the broth and mousse. The only negative was the tiny amount of trout, three tiny 1/4 inch strips of cured trout that was gone in three bites.WARM: Again there were four dishes with a couple vegetarian including the one we ordered.Tonarelli $16- this was a beautiful pasta dish with a sauce that made me want to lick the plate. Again not a huge portion but perfectly sized when combined with our other dishes. We added poached egg $2 which was needed but is never a bad thing on a plate of pasta.SIDE-the sides are meat and seafood and are actually the most expensive thingDungeness crab $20, again not a huge portion and perhaps not something I would get again, this was very sweet crab served already broken up but not unshelled and with a dipping sauce that was good but not needed.We had a bottle of sparkling water and house made tangerine cream soda that was delicious and made with fresh cream.Dessert there were three dessert choice all for 7 dollarsKey lime tart with quince compote and ice cream. This was not as inspired as the rest of the meal and a bit of disappointment.They add that damn Health Care fee rather than sucking it up and roll it into their costs. DECOR:The space is very simple with not a piece of reclaimed wood in sight but lots of sound baffling panels on the wall. I LOVE it. It's still noisy but not as bad as it could be. The chairs are wood and not the most comfortable. There is a small bar with 6 stools where the bartender is making creative cocktails since they don't have full liquor license.The space is wheelchair accessible but walk ways are narrow. The lighting was very good and the menu type was easy to read.With four courses and tax our bill was a little over $80s. Plan 20-40 per person without tip., 'This place has potential, but theyl need to work a bit more on the food and cocktails for me to have any desire to go back.As a vegetarian, I really like that the meats are listed as sides, which gives me more options, but I didn find the dishes particularly inventive at all:The yellow eye bean stew was good, but something you want to eat as a nice big bowl instead of a little taste; the tonnarelli pasta was overcooked and lacked much flavor; the dessert (lemon tart and Payday brownie) were actually really good and helped fill us up after a not-so-filling dinner.The best part of the meal were the fritters from the snack menu (light and crispy with a tasty aioli.) The biggest disappointment were the cocktails: We ordered two different ones and they were both overwhelmingly sweet and reminiscent of cough syrup. And while I think the one ice cube is a cute idea, you get punched in the nose by it with every sip. I really wish I liked this place more. It within walking distance to my house, the staff is really nice, the decor is refreshing and the chef seems like he knows his shit.But for $100+ for two people, I expect more creativity, variety and heartiness.', A lovely, fresh, and new dining experience. By flipping the menu on its head, emphasizing vegetables and seafood in the main menu and putting the meat dishes as sides, this restaurant attempts to bring us to a more healthy and sustainable approach to dinner. With flavorful vegetables (and even fruits) at the center of each plate, the food was was unusual but certainly delicious. Portions were small, but flavorsome. The cocktails (even without hard alcohol) were tastefully done and the wine list nicely curated. I think this place will continue to evolve and I'm already looking forward to coming back., Al's Place new to the Mission serves up some very delicious food, from Ubuntu alum Aaron London. The place is casual modern, but the service is nothing less than 5-star. I was not a huge fan of their drinks (neither their wine-based cocktails or their wines); however, I thought the food was really interesting (and very expensive for the portion!).Overall, worth visiting once for their unique food but a bit too pricey and small to become a regular in my rotation.* MR. BLUE ($10) - 3 STARS:A very cute and strong looking drink, made of wine based liquors and sherry's. Similar to Manhattan in flavor profile but too sweet for my taste. * GL JL CHAVE CAB ($11) - 3 STARS:I've had much better.* CURRY COD ($17) - 4.5 STARS:This curry sauce was nothing like I've had before. It was so flavorful and herbacious and served with a tender, fresh cod. Unfortunately, it was TINY and very expensive.* HANGER STEAK ($15) - 4.5 STARS:Perfectly cooked, and so unusual yet delicious served with crab butter! You could really taste the crab butter and it was a nice complement with the olive oil poached egg. The THREE DOLLAR olive oil poached egg.* PORK JOWL ($15) - 4.5 STARS:This thinly sliced jowl is apparently what the chef is most proud of. It was incredibly decadent and uber fatty, and complemented perfectly with the slightly salty and crispy seaweed. * TONARELLI ($16) - 4 STARS:Green garlic pesto sauce served with fresh tonarelli, which essentially is like a spaghetti noodle. It was really unique and tasty, and the noodles were on the doughy side. The green garlic made this dish spicy in some way, and very different, and the portion for me was more than enough. However, $16 seemed a little pricey for the plate. Note: 4% SF Mandate included in the tab., What we orderedGarden fritters, fennel mayo.Tasty, as expected but a great way to start. For a mayo connoisseur, the fennel mayo was magic.Cured trout, pickled green fig, kohirabi, potato.Top 3 dishes. Great combo of unique flavors. Very, very, fresh, meaty, mild yet insanely tasty-without-being-salty-at-all, cured trout.Jowel ham, seaweed, anchovies.Top 3 dishes. WOW. This is like nothing I've ever eaten. Brined and smoked it was smooth, soft, melty and complimented by the salty kelp and anchovies.Poached pullet egg, olive oil.We added this on top of the jowel to give it a nice yolky sauce.Turnip, currant soffritto, burrata, potato chips and skin puree.Interesting combo. Loved the turnips and the bizzare and pleasing salty crunch on top of the burrata. I awkwardly insisted on saving the puree for my bread...Sunchoke curry, black-lime cod, grapefruit.Enjoyed the curry and cod. The sourness or the grapefruit was appreciated but a little too over powering. I probably would not order this again.Tonarelli, green garlic, bergamot, botarga.Top 3. Really phenomenal for pasta lovers. Very simple and very rich. The complex flavors melded so well that this dish really leaves a lasting impression.Hanger steak, crab shell butter, sherry vinegar.Great cut, perfectly cooked rare and just the right amount for a side. A lighter take on a bordelaise, the butter and vinegar really make this a great add on.Corail Rose.Pretty sweet but didn't have any taste conflicts. Seemed to be ok with the variety of flavors.Brownie, chocolate peanut butter sauce, ice cream, peanut brittle.YES. You can't go wrong with this classic pairing.Cardamaro.Perfect herbal after dinner drink.The VibeThe decor was simple, white walls, white tile, a few art pieces on the walls of various media all with an asian influence. Very modern, bright interior, some candles in jars, nicely thought out succulent vignettes in the bathroom (an important and often neglected space in a restaurant). There's a small bar in the back and lots of 2 tops. We got a great seat by the window. The music was modern enough I recognized (and liked) the songs but quiety enough not to be distracting.The ServiceBeyond excellent. Our waitress Rebecca was attentive, courteous, answered all of our menu questions and honored all of our ridiculous requests, chatted with us for a bit, and even suggested a name for our new art project. WIN!! Everyone else that dropped by was equally nice and charming.The Over All AssessmentThis is the restaurant I've been waiting for -- my new fave hands down. Chances are, (if I know myself well) you'll be able to find me here once a week chowing down at the bar solo on the Jowel and Tonarelli making friends with everyone who works there. Can't go wrong here. It's well priced, got a friendly vibe, and most importantly -- boasts new flavors. Thank you SF, fucking finally!!!!, Lovely from start to finish. The service was exceptional from the moment we walked in the door, and the food was excellent, with the sunchoke curry with black cod being the high point. Yes, as other reviewers point out, the portions are small, and it's a little weird. It's like a menu of small plates, but the dishes aren't the usual small-plate fare. Perplexing, but the flavors were good enough to offset any confusion about the format of the menu., 'Wow. What a fantastic flight of food. The dessert of fruit w coconut cream was our fav. The Bucatini with arugula sauce was amazing. My fav was the trout carpaccio. And Aaron is cool.', The restaurant has promise. It is a great looking space, and the service was great. The food was generally good, though sometimes dishes suffered from overkill. The turnip and currant combination was great, but the addition of burrata coated in potato chips was confusing--it didn't meld flavor-wise with the other components of the dish. And the mild taste of the burrata was overshadowed by the chips. The cured trout dish was good, but I also felt that it didn't quite come together--the mild flavor of the trout was lost in the dish. The quality of all the components of these dishes was excellent--but they ended up being simply good, not exceptional taken as a whole.The home-run dish was the sun-choke curry with black-lime cod, which was perfection. The flavor of the tonarelli was good, but ours was overcooked, and on the gummy side. The jowel ham was very rich, and the seaweed and anchovy accompaniment, which one might expect to cut the richness, did not. We had a really great white rioja, which was a pleasant discovery (who knew?), and the other wine selections were strong. In the final analysis, I'm in no hurry to go back., 'I must have visited Ubuntu (the chef prior gig in Napa) 20 times, so I must admit that I had a set of expectations for what he can turn out. When I heard that Al place was going to feature veggies with meat as a side dish it further reinforced my mind set that it was going to be Ubuntu like. I spent this evening after the meal debating whether my Ubuntu expectations were a problem. In sum, this evening meal fell short of being as pleasant, interesting, or successful as the many prior meals at Ubuntu. The meal at Al could be summed up as fine, but not great.  First, even thought the place has only been open for a week or two, the service was superb (attentive, friendly, helpful). As for the food, my thoughts are as follows: 1) vadouvan almonds - a carry over from the Ubuntu days, were fine, though a touch too sweet and a touch lacking in the depth of curry flavors one hopes for here. 2) chickpeas a la catalan, quince romesco - also ok, but not as sublime as the fried chickpea clusters of the old Ubuntu days. 3) turnip, currant soffritto, burrata, potato chips and skin puree - this dish worked well, had a nice complexity of flavors, and was deemed the second best dish of the evening. 4) sunchoke curry, black lime, cod, grapefruit - I fully agree with the already posted comments, this dish was absolutely outstanding, -- a wonderful cascade of flavors that comes together and works well. The dish of the evening. 5) tonarelli, green garlic, bergamot, botarga - We thought this was misguided - with a strong taste of green garlic that just doesn meld well with bergamot and botarga. Deemed the failure of the evening. 6) duck confit with quince - fine, but a rather small portion and it would be nice if the meny explained the three quite different versions of the duck dish (do ask, they aren just three different portion sizes, but three quite different dishes, which is not at all evident).  The wine list is interesting, short, and fairly reasonable.  In sum, I would likely give it another try a few months down the line. However, without some major improvements and changes during future visits, I can foresee this being the Ubuntu-llke destination restaurant of years past.', Definitely felt they were doing quite well on the food and service for a place that opened so recently.Inventive dishes with interesting ingredient/flavor/texture combinations. Reminded me of Rich Table in that regard. The asparagus (that's what it was tonight), currant soffritto, burrata, potato chips and skin puree was brilliant.The wine list was disappointing. The wines obscure - but not in a good way - and bland. They definitely need to step it up a lot on the wine selections to bring it up to the level of the food. You want inspired pairings to go with this inspired food., Al's place is cute and has a fun menu but nothing is specifically delicious. The pasta was the saltiest pasta I have ever had, the yellow bean stew was pretty good and the salads were about the size of one cup and cost $12 each. Nothing was overwhelmingly delicious and they don't have liquor. Although we did get a light show from all the police activity that drove by throughout the meal., 'I was so happy to hear that the ex Ubuntu chef decided to launch his own restaurant at Al Place!!! Ubuntu in Napa (closed a few years back) was one of my favorite restaurants ever. Food is totally solid, flavors popping unexpectedly cooked perfectly. No snobby pretense vibe. Great service. Food favorites were:Sunchoke curry with cod (superb, unique)The snacks - olives prepared very unusuallyThe fancy green pasta dish - get this with an eggDessert was ok (brownie) but the truly special dishes are the ones above. Love how the meat dishes are sides and very friendly to both vegetarians and carnivores alike. We are coming back!', I'm a little shocked given this chef's outstanding reputation.Not a single dish I'd come back for.I'd rethink and would scrap the entire menu.The excellent service staff deserves to serve a better end product to its customers., As a vegetarian and a mourner of Ubuntu, I was super excited to try Al's Place. And the food truly did not disappoint. The grits with goat cheese curd and salsa negre was lovely, and a dish of room temperature brassicas (some raw, some roasted) hit the right notes. Best of all was were the pickled/fermented fries - truly original and delicious.So why two stars? Price and service. That little plate of brassicas was 15 dollars. Rough. The grits were 16 on the menu - and rang up as 17 on the check. These are crazy, crazy prices, for fairly small plates.To be fair, we were warned by the wait staff that portions were small. Three times. We were told that we should get 2-3 dishes per person, and were asked multiple times during the meal whether we wanted anything else. This really struck me as overselling, and it got old fast. (For the record, the food was pretty rich and satisfying, and we weren't very hungry so didn't want to overorder.)Speaking of fast, the food came out fast. As in, frantically. We had two courses, plus a round of cocktails, but we were in and out in exactly 50 minutes. No joke. (That's pretty fast for a bill that totaled $86 after tax and tip.)Also, the restaurant seems to be taking a community approach to service. There were probably eight servers in the place, and we interacted with every one of them. I guess that creates efficiencies, but I felt like no one was caring for us and we were rushed out. We certainly would have ordered another round of drinks (the sherry-based cocktails were really nice) but by the time we finished the first round, the food was gone.Oh well., 'Good grits. The ice cream was also great.The bean stew was ok.Burrata and asparagus were good.', I was a fan of Chef Aaron London's previous restaurant, the Michelin starred Ubuntu in Napa, so as soon as I heard he opened Al's Place in San Francisco I immediately made a reservation. My fiancee and I were not disappointed. She is a former sous-chef at a Michelin two-starred restaurant in Los Angeles and knows her food. Every dish we tried was superb - great presentation, interesting textures and subtle flavors. The service was excellent - we had a perfect evening.In reading some of the other reviews, I am amazed that anyone could give Al's less than a top rating - well I guess those are the folks that keep McDonald's in business., 'Went with a friend a couple weeks ago. We both were very impressed with the foods. The menu are creative and interesting.We ordered the french fries that the staff recommended to us. How much better can a french fries be, we thought. But when we heard how the fries were prepared, we were intrigued. It was the best french fries. The fries has the perfect texture. Slightly ouncyand it has a uttyflavor. We also ordered 2 of the cold dishes: baby lettuces, herbed avocado, quince crumble and grilled asparagus, currant soffritto, burrata, potato chips and skin puree. The combination of the burrata topped with crumbled potato chips and currant soffritto were really yum. I was very impressed that the chef used potato skin puree as the sauce. That was such a creative way of combining different ingredients and they amplified the flavors.The sunchoke curry, black lime-cod, grapefruit was really good. Using the sunchoke puree in a curry instead of coconut milk made the dish so light yet satisfying.we ended our dinner with citrus salad, coconut foam, caramelized flax seed for dessert. It was so refreshing. I often think that foam is over-rated, but this time the coconut foam works really well with the dish. And I never was a fan of flax seed before, but toasted caramelized flax seeds are just tasty.I really enjoyed the dinner. I am not a wine drinker, but my friend was disappointed with the wine selection. But as far as I am concern the foods were just perfect.', 'I drove all they way out to the Mission and really just wanted a burrito but met some folks at Als Place. We tried everything except the bavette steak. The flavors of all the dishes was outstanding. My favorites were the pasta, the curry, grilled octopus and believe it or not the coconut foam with grapefruit.Make sure you go with your rich uncle!', 'Outstanding food and service, lots of love and care throughout every layer of every dish. The duck with quince mole and the yellow eyed beans were delicious. The space is beautiful, quite remarkable the caliber of food that is coming out of such a cozy kitchen.', Did a tasting menu and the only thing I'd come back for is the olives...maybe the fries. That says a lot., '$120 per person (see photo of the check)6 people, 2 bottles of wine (not expensive) = $571 (before tip)Food - 2 stars - some items were good, some were interesting, some were a joke (pile of lettuce on a platter, I looking at you), overall nothing was outstanding or memorable.Service - 4 stars - nice/professional/obviously really good actors - It has to be really hard to hand over the bill without apologizing, running, or laughing at the table for falling for the most overpriced/underwhelming meal theye ever had.Worth the price - negative 10 stars - as one of my fellow diners said, With so many really good/great affordable places to eat in this city, why would anyone come here? We fell for it, but only once!I happy to spend a $120 for a great meal. This was not a great meal. I really think the owner is just sitting back and laughing at all of us for paying our checks (while counting piles of money). I will say the best part of the evening was watching other diners as they received the check (disgust, eye rolling, head shaking, embarrassment)', Horrible service, we didn't even get past the hostess. We had a 7:45 reservation for four for two weeks, we were very much wanting to go. When we got there (10 min late) they had given our table away, but didn't bother to tell us that. If fact when we did get there they said it would only be a min as they were waiting for a table to pay. When we complains at 8:15 THATS when they blamed us and said they have the table away. A call or a text to check-in before they gave our table away would have been appropriate for a restaurant of such high esteem. Letting us know, as soon as we arrived that the table was gone should have been obvious. The front management was vague, then rude. We left and went to The Palace as it didn't appear that we were going to get seated anytime soon. There are so (too!) many incredible restaurants in this city. Most of which know how to treat the customers who are looking forward to investing their time and money in the experience of eating there. I highly recommend sending your patronage to any of them., 'Delicious and innovative food with very attentive service. The sunchoke curry, fish mullet, and tonnarelli were are favorites. The restaurant is on a corner, with plenty of windows, making the atmosphere bright with a gorgeous romantic light coming through to the tables. We will definitely be coming back to try this restaurant again!', I was really looking forward to eating here. We arrived at 700 on a Saturday evening and were greeted by the hostess who was very nice and showed us right to our seats! The space is very nice on the corner of 26th and Valencia. Pretty much a full house by the time we arrived but it never felt cramped or too loud. The waitress came over and explained the menu and took our drink orders. They don't have a full liquor license so I'm glad we stopped at ABV first. We had the burrata to start. We were stunned by how small the portions were in relation to the price. It's all we could talk about every time a new dish would hit the table. Jovanie and Adrienne got the duck confit and the duck breast. I ordered the grits and the tonorelli. The grits were ok but I've had better. Though to be fair to the chef, I got the peas on the side because I don't like them. Everyone else said the peas were delicious. My tonorelli was pretty awesome and was the most memorable part of the meal. But the sides and the cold dishes were boring, bland or too small. And I read from the reviews about the portion sizes so I thought I was prepared. I guess I wasn't. The desserts were fine. I had a warm brownie with peanut butter ice cream. I believe Jovanie got some kind of fruit tartlet. I really wanted to love this place. But I didn't . I'm glad I went, the space is nice, the service was very good but the food is over priced and Jovanie left hungry after we spent 250., I've tried almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed. Great for vegetarians!, What a pleasant surprise. We dined here last Friday night. Having had my expectations lowered as to portion size, I didn't find that it was an issue.The space on 26th @ Valencia is cozy, open, and airy. There appear to be a few bar seats available from where you can watch the open kitchen and the chefs.Now then, bring me my food and drink!Nice, tight, compact, interesting wine list. 4/5Started off with the fries with the smoky applesauce dip - On point and the dip was surprisingly tasty. 3.5/5Asparagus - wonderfully presented and creatively flavored. Delicious. 4.5/5Tonnarelli - Solid and flavorful. 4/5Cod with sunchoke curry and grapefruit - inventive and full of flavor! 4.5/5Hangar steak - UNREAL. One of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. Don't miss it. 5/5Brownie dessert - the only letdown of the night. Just average. 3/5All told: 2 glasses of wine, 5 dishes - shared, dessert, dessert wine - $160 total (tip included). We left full, while not stuffed.Great experience; great service with a team-based approach.Aaron London and his staff know what they're doing...whether with vegetables or meat. As long as you expect smaller portions (and as long as the hangar steak's on the menu), you shouldn't leave disappointed.Food: 5Value: 3.5Service: 4.5Ambiance: 4Overall: 4.5 (rounded down to 4 for Yelp's purposes), I am thrilled Al's place has opened within a 10 minute walk of my home. I am vegetarian and mourned the loss of Ubuntu greatly. Al's Place does the memory of Ubuntu justice.We have been here twice and this time around feel like they have worked out portion sizes and the service so are happy to rate 5 stars! The FoodWe ordered 3 dishes (including the smaller snacks) per person. We aren't very big eaters so 2 of the larger dishes would have sufficed. Everything was great!Yellow Eye Bean Stew - exceptional, hearty, delicately spiced, bowl licking goodGarden Fritters - so soft and the Fennel mayo was divineAlmonds- Marcona with some awesome spice. Easy snacking but easy to fill up on!Grits - simple and comforting. Smooth grits with flavorful veggiesFergola with fermented pea broth- I don't like peas. I ate every bit of this.Catalan chickpeas - the only dish I would say was just ok. Nothing bad but not amazing.Dessert-get the brownie over the tart!ServiceFriendly and attentive. You are served by everyone, but this time it also included the chef :)VibeRelaxed and almost casual if it weren't for the line of people waiting! Packed on a Wednesday evening., Service was great. Wine list kind of expensive but the waitress recommended an affordable and good wine.Overall, food was pretty disappointing. I wouldn't go back there for any dish we had. Nothing was bad, but nothing was that good, especially for the prices., Half the meal was great. Half the meal was gross. The menu is too short to have room for error. I usually don't write reviews (despite eating out 5+ dinners a week), but I had to here. This was just so... strange. Pork Jowl - tasty, but it was litterally slices of fat pudding with no texture of anything else. Was not served with other yelp reviewer's mention of crispy anything. The thought of it still grosses me out. Maybe the anorexic teenager in me, but, no. No one wants to slurp 5 ounces of fat.  I just looked at other yelp reviewers' photos of this dish and ours looked nothing like it. Our slices had ZERO meat. It was ALL fat. Why would you serve that??Cured cod - with green tea and quince. Flavors clashed. It didn't make any sense.Pea soup with lemongrass fish broth - very good. my date hated the pickled strawberries in there. I didn't mind.Duck with mole - very good. perfectly cooked. mole was just right. could have used the dimension of pickled strawberries on the side. Potato fritters (snack)- mashed potato balls. Could have done without. The fennel mayo was very good. BTW I was really looking forward to the hanger steak but it was not on the menu. Wine recommendation - very good. Until several reliable foodie friends recommend otherwise, I'll be spending meals elsewhere. Sad. I really really wanted to like it., The portions are unnaturally tiny for the price. There's not much to choose from on this menu. The dishes sound innovative but don't quite hit the spot. We ended up going to La Taqueria after for REAL dinner.Also I came here looking for the tonnarelli and the steak, neither of which were on the menu tonight. Dishes:-Radishes - had dirt on them-French fries - meh, but Apple sauce was good-Olives - had some weird cinnamon spice on them-Duck - wasn't very tasty-Fish - also wasn't tasty-Pasta - salty-Baby lettuce salad - only good thing I atePaid $100 for essentially a round of appetizers...don't think I'll be going back., I had high hopes walking in Al's Place a few weeks ago with my cousin. I loved the written-about approach to vegetables first and meats second, and was excited to see how they pulled it off. In the end, I wasn't terribly impressed. The service was good, but I found the food to be good, but nothing special, and nowhere near enough in portion size for the prize. Now, I'm all in favor of reducing the all-American portion size to something more humanlike, but here it still was too small even by those standards.I had the sunchoke curry with black cod, which was a lot of sauce and not a lot of substance - whether of the veggies or the cod. My cousin's pasta (some green variety that I don't recall right now) was good. But again...it was pasta. Shouldn't I be more wowed by actual veggie dishes than pasta at a place like this? We also shared a burrata salad of some sort, which again was fine, but just so.I've been blown away by amazing vegetable sides at restaurants recently and fully expected Al's to make incredible dishes like those and present them as entrees. Instead, they shared interesting food intellectually but boring on the palate and small on the plate. Hopefully this is a growing pain and they'll be improvement down the road., I really wanted to love this place. Too much bitter seaweed. Atmosphere and service was great, but the food was not at all worth it. Imaginative dishes didn't turn out to have any grounding. We ended up going to Pi bar for a slice of pizza afterwards. Definitely not for people who aren't into fancy food. And even for foodies with deep pockets, it is going to be a bit polarizing.The bread was delicious, but that probably shouldn't be the highlight., 'While I understand that the Chefs of the world must be allowed the freedom to use whatever ingredients well up from their creative depths, it would be nice if said ingredients made it to the menu description. First, I must tell you the flavors were amazing. We ordered the Fritters, Lettuce, Trout, Grits Smoked meat; all fantastic. But the lettuce, yes the lettuce, had a crumble made with pistachios, and you guessed it, I am allergic. I knew within two bites. I said, Damn under my breath and my wife caught it. What? she said. There nuts in this I said as the old familiar itchy feeling settled in my throat. My wife, being very outspoken immediately whipped her hand up. Excuse me! A waiter came over and my wife asked if the salad was made with nuts. He said, Yes, there are pistachios in the crumble. Boom. Usually, when this happens, I put knife and fork down and wait. Sometimes the reaction is mild; after all, I only had a few bites. There was a quick flurry of activity as one or two other waiters came over. After a few minutes of my self-assessing, a young woman wearing orange (who I assume must be the hostess as she greeted us at the door) came over with pen, a paper and a stern look and said, I kid you not, Do you want to tell me the rest of your allergies? I was very clearly made to feel that by not announcing my allergies ahead of time, I was at fault. How dare I put the restaurant in such jeopardy. My wife is a Chef, so when this hostess (or was she the manager?) said that pistachios did not appear on the menu because the Chef must be free to exercise his technique. I knew her head was about to pop. By this time I also knew that my nut reaction had peaked and there would be no need for epipens or ambulances. Honestly, the food was great. Go. Enjoy. The wait-staff were exceptional. It is not that I had a reaction to the pistachios. It is that I had no idea I was eating them, and that after I had done so, I was made to feel bad about it. The only thing I was offered from the young woman in the orange blouse was Would you like me to wrap up the rest of what you ordered to-go? As we left I filled out the comment card, Please let your guests know that there are nuts in the food. Nut allergies are no joke. As an Emergency Room nurse I know what I am talking about. restaurant.org/News-Rese43_4 stars for taste, 1 star for guest treatment.', I expected more for the hype and the price. Took a friend here for a birthday dinner. It was 6:30 on Thursday. They make you call back to confirm (vs. just leaving a message saying if you need to cancel, call us). I'm there at 6:30, my friend is running 5 min late, restaurant is 1/3 full. She won't seat me until he arrives and I no I don't want to sit at the bar (if I was an alcoholic, don't want to be waiting at a bar). Please just seat me at my table NOW while there are 5 other empty 2-tops. She has a li'l attitude, we won't be friends... The ambiance is lovely. Beautiful minimalist modernist space. Our server seems confident. I'm undecided on a wine, maybe you can offer a taste to help me decide? I try my friend's glass of Rose. It's lovely.On to the food: Very intricate, intriguing flavors, but the plates are on the small side of small tastes that will maybe satisfy 2 people. Everything is plated in a deconstructed manner; you gotta mix things together for (hopefully) the full effect. At least it makes it easy to ensure each person got exactly half of the small plate.1. Tiny radishes served with huge side of infused butter; I try with a knife; butter slides off... All this butter left over and no where to go. OMG, how much water was used to milk the cow for all that extra butter? Kindly offer me a glass of water when we're seated and don't make me have to ask.2. Asparagus with burrata ++: server didn't mention this as a fave, but so glad we ordered. Burrata was phenomenally prepared. Currants and asparagus were amazing, but again you needed to mix them right to get the full effect.3. Duck w/ strawberry mole +++: great flavors, make sure you get sauce with every bite. But why served BEFORE the cod and pasta? This should be last.4. Black limed cod with broth and strawberry slices; could use more cod and two more strawberry slices (6 not 4); cod +/-, strawberries++5. Lightly cured trout with potatoes +/-: 4 slivers of smoked trout, not much flavor. If you're going light on the serving, up the flavor6.Pasta served last (huh?); unmemorable7. Dessert was chocolate brownie a la mode with payday candybar center. Did the chef run out of creative juices ?Bottom line: $167 before tip for two people, 7 small dishes and 4 glasses of wine. I'd prefer Local Mission Eatery for a sustainable farm-to-table dinner in the Mission., 'Finally got into try Al Place last night and had really high hopes for a great new neighborhood spot I could frequent often since it just up the street from me. FOOD:Overall the food was really delicious - creative and interesting flavors with beautiful presentations. The only real bummer from the food was the entire Snackles section. Flavors were boring and portions were laughable. The homemade fries & ketchup was comprised of about 8 french fries for $6 and the stewed chickpeas had (and I kid you not) about 10 single chickpeas in a bland tomato sauce for $6. If I came back I would avoid this whole section.DRINKS:No full liquor license so all cocktails are sherry/vermouth based. Some interesting combinations but after one drink, that was enough sweetness for us and we moved on to wine.ATMOSPHERE:Great waitstaff, very friendly and welcoming. Decor doesn match the type of food coming out of the kitchen. Extremely stark, boring interior thats maybe a little too casual feeling for a dinner that ended up costing us $400. Seafoam green painted floor is hideous.VALUE:This is where the 5 stars earned by the delicious food gets knocked down to overall 3 stars for the restaurant review. The price-to-portion ratio here is obnoxious, to the point I was close to saying something to the Manager. Everything is 30% too expensive, with dishes listed at $15-18, when they should be $10-12 for the amount of food you receive. We had a group of 4 so we were encouraged to double up on every dish we wanted to order. They brought each dish out family style with both orders on one plate, which was great, except that the dishes were the size of what you get anywhere else for a single order. For example, we ordered one of the salads, at $17 per portion, we quickly realized that small dish in front of us was $34 for a freakin salad! Probably worked out to about $1 per lettuce leaf. This theme continued with every single course.I would love to go back because the food was so good, but at $200/couple to dine there, it way too steep to be a frequent neighborhood spot. If prices come down or portion sizes go up, I will consider going back, otherwise I rather spend that money elsewhere.', 'i love this place!! the service was great. my bf and i accidentally made two reservations for two different times, called to cancel one but cancelled the wrong one. we showed up and they weren hesitant about seating us as the place wasn too full yet (whew! bc it quickly filled up and people were left to wait). bread is served on request and when we finished the first slices we were immediately offered a second. and when dessert rolled around, we ordered the pay day brownie with peanut butter ice cream. as time went on and our dessert was nowhere to be found, our server came over to tell us that it was just warming up and would be right out. when it arrived, it turns out the delay in brownie action was because they hadn made the pb ice cream for the day. they served the brownie sans ice cream on the house, which was much more pleasant than just a simple whoopsies. the food was awesome! i would say that a lot of the menu is vegetariancentric, which is usually a deterrent for me but i heard good things so i wanted to give it a shot. to share we ordered:green pea curry with lime-black cod and pickled strawberry-- so light and brothy! the strawberries gave the pea curry a bright splash of acidity and the almost silky fish gave it just enough of a savory hit. asparagus, currant soffritto, burrata, potato chips and skin puree--SO good! such a flavorful and enchanting dish. the fresh vegetables matched with the velvety feel of milky burrata and crunch from the chips made for a party in my mouth. this may have been my favorite dish of the night and it vegetarian. shocking!fish mullet with garlic dip--whoa whoa whoa, this was NOT what i was expecting from a restaurant with beautifully plated and presented dishes. you are essentially brought out two sides of a fish that have been deboned but still have their fins. the meat is super fatty and the skin crisp. you are meant to pull the parts off to dip into a very aerated creamy garlic dip and voila(!) a crazy good bite in your mouth! verrry good and quite japanese in my opinion.grits, goats milk curd, peas and yellowfoot mushrooms- just a solid grits plate. so creamy but with some nice bites of grain. peanut butter ice cream and warm brownie with pay day filling--as previously stated, we didn get the pb ice cream but the brownie was very good and super rich. the ice cream woulde cut through that and made it pretty damn satisfying. overall, i love this place. true, the dishes are a bit small and you may leave a little hungry...OR you could just order more!', This place is okay, but not exciting. I had selected this spot to meet up with a couple of high school classmates I hadn't seen in a while, and I wish I'd picked a more memorable establishment.The hostess wouldn't seat us until our whole party appeared, so the two of us who showed up earliest waited around awkwardly at the front of the restaurant where there's not much space. Thankfully, once our third person got there, we asked to be seated and were accommodated without fuss.We were told that the bread is toasted when people request it, so that's why it takes a little longer than expected to come out. It was a bit burnt on the outside by the time it arrived at our table. Perhaps they shouldn't have toasted it for so long.The food was fine, and their intention to make vegetables the centerpieces was overridden by the ability to order enough meat sides to make up for this shift in the menu. Everyone agreed that the smoked brisket was the best thing we ordered. (I really wanted to try the hanger steak with crab butter, but it wasn't available tonight.)The ladies in my party were comfortably full at the end of our stay here, but one of the guys went around the corner to La Taqueria for a taco afterwards. (The damage per person after tax and tip was just over $30.)The verdict: Skip this place if you're looking for a memorable experience. I'm probably going to forget that I was ever here by the same time tomorrow. I'll have to make it up to the friends I met up with some other time., It's a typical 3.5 stars place. Yelp is right on. Everything was good but not great. I'm sure it would have been one of the best restaurants in LA but in SF you need to be a lot better to make it to 4-5 stars... The ambience is great, pretty hip with good energy. Ingredients were fresh. Service is great, super friendly staff but again the food was good not great... Too bad, the place has a lot of potential..., Nothing memorable about the meal here. Had high hopes and good memories from Ubuntu in Napa. Trout was 3 tiny pieces of sashimi. The bean soup promises to be 'hearty' but was a small watery portion of soup. Nothing special except for the unusual torn bread bits. Saving grace was the brisket. Smokey, tasty, fatty. It hit all the right notes. Given all the choices in SF, probably wouldn't be back here again., Found this place on a list of the Hottest Restaurants in SF May 2015 and my friend and I being the foodies that we are, we decided to drop in.We made reservations and were seated immediately upon arrival. The server was extremely helpful in providing advice on the selections we made. This place has only been open for 3 months, but there was quite a crowd!Small portions, fresh seasonal ingredients, and great seasoning and presentation.Note that everything is priced under $20, but portions are small. Between 2 people, we ordered 4 plates. We were not stuffed, but satisfied (good place to be).I was a bit surprised at the limited menu, but once I started to really look into it, I wanted to order everything.Baby lettuces, herbed avocado, quince crumble - gotta love my greens, especially when they're so crunchy, juicy, and fresh! The creamed herbed avocado was a nice touch.Asparagus, currant soffritto, burrata, potato chips and skin purd9e - our server's favorite, so we ordered it. Asparagus was perfectly cooked and like she said, it didn't even taste like asparagus... The potato chips and skin purd9e. The potato chips looked like what you'd find at the bottom of your Lay's chips bag, but omg the purd9e was creamy, flavorful and so damn good.Grits, goat's milk curds, peas, yellow foot mushrooms - the peas weren't mushy, thank goodness. This was pretty much my comfort food. Creamy, not too salty, simple grits. They had these braised fava beans that they braise for a minimum of 8 hours... crazy. Would order again.Fish mullet, preserved lime, garlic dip - probably my favorite. They served us black cod and it was fluffy, tender, and packed with flavor. I don't usually eat the skin, but I couldn't resist this one.They were accommodating to my friend's no-gluten-diet and made sure to point out everything that she could eat without worrying (and we had a lot of choices). I'm excited to see their next season's menu and would love to try it again!, We had an amazing dinner at Al's place last night. Not only was everything that we had delicious (asparagus burrata, fregola pasta, salmon and fish mullet), but the entire staff seemed invested in the restaurant and excited to be there. It's so nice to go to a new place and see staff fired up to be a part of your experience. We will definitely be back!, 'This was my first time here and I really enjoyed the whole experience. We were seated right away even though two members of our party had not yet arrived. We ordered some sparkling Rose and a few of the snackles while we waited. We knew we were in for some good food when the vadouvan almonds and olives with ras el hanout delighted us. The rest of our party arrived and we decided to get the family style dinner and added the steak and pork belly to share. We definitely were well fed and had plenty to eat. While the meats were delicious, in the end I could have done without them since all of the other dishes were quite savory. The vegetables were outstanding and something as seemingly simple as a plate of baby lettuces really demonstrated the care in the selection of the produce. I felt like I could taste the earth where the lettuce was grown it was so flavorful. Will go back for sure.', 'Truly amazing food. Fresh, well thought out, new flavors. We had great friendly service and loved everything. A great place to share everything with the table.', 'Excellent food and attention to detail. Interesting concept. Good service. Serious about the food. Ambience is basic. Enjoyed the meal, but beware the check can run up on you. Biggest downside - sitting next to foodies who literally took 15 minutes to go through the menu with the server!', We tried six dishes and loved them all! Accommodating kitchen, smart service, nice wine list. Also a fun cocktail list. Great vibe. I can't wait to go back!, Came here on a weeknight and was asked if we had reservations by the hostess and we didn't but we were seated immediately without having to wait anyway. The plates were small and ideally meant to be shared. The food was what I would call interesting if you're looking to challenge your palate as there were definitely some plates that you wouldn't normally find elsewhere and they weren't bad by any means, it's just different. Over all, it was a pleasant experience, the only thing though is that it's pricey when you're ordering 4-5 plates to share between two people with room to spare so be prepared., 'When we sat down the waiter informed us we had to do the prefix menu because we had a large party. Unfortunately, that menu was way above what we were wanting to spend and we were never given that information beforehand. When we told the restaurant that they said they informed us that our party of 6 must do the prefix menu on Open Table, but I never saw or heard that information. Then, I went back to look and this is exactly what was written and it was there no matter what the party size is:FOR LARGE PARTIES: The base family style menu is priced at $60 per person. You get snacks, 5 savory courses and dessert. You can add on as many sides (proteins) as you like at the price listed on the a la carte menu.NO WHERE on the site, email or on the call, was it defined what a large party is, and even in the confirmation emails and phone calls I got from the restaurant where they have all the opportunity to be specific and put this information at the top of the email, not once was it said that our party would be forced into a prefix menu. Additionally, we were all very hungry when we sat but they took their time deciding whether or not to let us order off the regular menu only to decide that they wouldn and forced us to order from the prefix menu. It was really poor customer service and sad because I was so excited for this place and their new concept, but it seems like wee not the only people really disappointed by their service. Maybe they should have been more flexible in their opening months.', This is probably some of the most solid food I've had in a while, and I'm surprised at how on point the food is despite having just opened. They're located close to Caesar Chavez, which means it's slightly easier to park.Unfortunately, it's beer and wine only. They have an interesting beer selection. I started with a Mr. White (wine based cocktail), which was a bit sweet for me despite the orange bitters. Then, I had a glass of Nebbiolo, which was ok. The cabernet sauvignon was better - like a typical cab - and the pour was very generous.You start with warm Josey Bakery bread. When given the option of butter vs olive oil, definitely go for the salted house butter.Food:- Fries with smoked apple sauce: I actually liked the fries - they're like In n Out fries with more of a bite, but my boyfriend didn't love these. The dip was really good, though- Asparagus: one of the best burratas I've had in a long time. Theirs was properly seasoned and topped with fried thin potato chips. The asparagus was tender, but what made the dish was the currant soffrito.- Morels: I don't even like mayo, but their green fava mayo underneath was very subtle. Between the radishes and the pickled peach relish, this dish had so many flavors, textures, and colors and was a great representation of spring- Grits: I often think grits taste like cream of wheat, but theirs had just the right amount of butter and a good texture. The spring peas were just barely cooked and had good texture, and the goat's milk curds added creaminess (but maybe I would have liked the tanginess of goat cheese better?) The 8 hour fava was a bit unexpected, and it made the dish interesting- Green pea curry: I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's like a soupy green thai curry with lemongrass in the background. The sauce is fragrant, and the cod is very tender; the strawberries added a different dimension of sweetness. The curry was definitely the star (over the cod)- Duck with strawberry mole: strawberries and mole sound odd, but the sweet acid complements the mole well, and the cocoa is very subtle. The duck was cooked well and wasn't too gamey, and it had a hint of five spice. I was happily surprised by this dish- Brisket: this dish was pretty amazing. Most brisket tastes about the same, but theirs was so tender with all the fat rendered out and like a cross between semi smoky brisket and pastrami. It came with an amazing maple mustard and some pickled vegetables, topped with a sieved egg (like hard boiled egg crumbles). This was a great protein dishThis was a substantial amount of food for two of us, but I'm glad we got to try a variety of things. Each dish was much better than I had anticipated, and they take some bold attempts with very unique food ideas (like strawberry mole!). Like I said, everything ran very smoothly considering they had just opened, and it's probably some of the most innovative food I've had at a new restaurant in SF for a while., Al's Place looks like a plain Jane when viewed from the outside; but inside, the newly remodeled space is beautiful. A gem. And the servers are all enthusiastic and proud of what they are serving. And well they might be, as at worst the food is quite good and at its best the food can be stunning.I started with asparagus, currant soffritto, burrata, potato chips and skin purd9e. This was very nicely done, although I have had creamier burrata.Yellow eye bean stew with torn bread was more soup than stew. But the depth and complexity of flavors in the broth was wonderful. A winner.Next brisket. The meat itself was lovely. Unfortunately, there was more fat than meat on some cuts of the protein. This plate was taken off my bill without any quibble. Shows the restaurant cares about patrons response to what they are served. However, when I return to Al's Place, and were brisket on the menu, I would certainly order it again.A salad of baby lettuces with herbed avocado and quince crumble was perfection on a plate. Absolutely wonderful. If you go to Al's, and you should, get this as it will change how you view a salad. This is now one of my favorite places in the city., Four of us had a really tasty meal here last night. The food is def 5 stars outstanding. Favorites were the steak with clamshell butter (be aware it really is just a side of sliced meat) we did 2 orders for 4 of us. The burrata and asparagus was amazing.Good dark Josie Baker bread and butter. Fries were nice, apple sauce an odd condiment. The green salad had a really good avocado cream and everyone enjoyed the little kick of hotness in the pearl pasta. Pb ice cream brownie and lemon tart for dessert. I'm not a fan of austere plain decor, hipster servers and the location on Valencia and 26th does nothing for me but Als Place makes up for things that I don't care for with amazing food at fair prices., '4 companions, 10 diverse plates, 3 vermouth cocktails, 0 room for dessert, 1 loud dining success.Not including drinks and tax/tip, this rang out around $35pp. Leave your expectations at the door and just sit down, order, and enjoy away.', First time here and I'll be back. Lots said in the other reviews about the quality and creativity of the food and that Al's is a bit pricey. Just increase the serving sizes a bit and the prices will also seem a bit more inline. Great space, great serving staff!, The food here is amazing - 5 stars! I've been twice and the food has been fantastic. The reason for the lower rating is their reservation/service policy. They don't seem to answer their phone, ever. I had a reservation confirmed and learned that my other party would be 30 minutes late on the day of the reservation. I tried calling the restaurant 7 times to ask if it would be okay.. no answer. It is beyond frustrating, 'highly recommend. very interesting flavor combinations and excellent service and atmosphere.'|1
5|ame-san-francisco|Had the opportunity to experience Ame for the first time last night, not for a full dinner but to sample some food and wine. The space is very modern, and you quickly forget you're near the corner of 3rd and Mission (a good thing). We sampled a few raw treatments and even some beef cheeks, all were good indications of great things to come out of the kitchen. The bar, which services both the hotel St. Regis and the restaurant, is well appointed and appears to already be the place to meet and mingle amongst San Francisco's elite. Being situated on the same block as where I work only leads me to believe that I'll be a regular in some form or another, God bless my Diner's Club card., This reviews the hotel lobby bar, not so much the restaurant.Decor and attitude are a perfect cross between the W (trendy, cool, hip, interesting) and the Four Seasons (classy, elegant, rich, professional). They've hired some of the best bartenders (e.g. Megan from Ozumo), doormen, hostesses in town. The open indoor / outdoor lobby does not separate the hotel, bar, restaurant, valet. The elevator bank and reception/concierge desks are so beautiful you want to go there just to gawk, and I appreciate the way (perhaps due to limited space) the residences are a glassed in lobby-within-the-lobby rather than a secret subversive entrance.The furniture, lighting, and other appointments are a wonder. No way in a million years, unlimited budget, and whatever education could I ever do this myself. You realize what art there is to interior design. Standouts include the custom carpeting and other flooring, the walls of perpendicular articulated bent wood panels in the dining room, a gas wood and pebbles lobby fireplace that makes Matrixfillmore look like a state park grill by comparison, and two huge and very provocative paintings of a naked angel and her homoerotic lover, bunnies, mounted warriors, and competitive athletes off the bar that would take a few pages to describe.The restaurant's deep-fusion showoff menu looks amazing. Drink prices are wicked-expensive, as bad or worse than Redwood Room. There are fre mini-bento boxes of wasabi peas and rice crackers to go along, as well as a bar menu. Patrons were insufferably stuffy, the millionaire and his wife clones from Gilligan's Island, but the staff is nice enough and would serve you if you came in sweats. Think that they are throwing in the sight and spectacle for free if you will only pay for your drink., 'I had the five ahi tuna appetizer and a grouper special. Some of the ahi tastes were better than others, my favorite being the ahi loin. The Grouper was excellent and I loved the boullabase sauce that it sat in. Some things in this japanese fusion restaurant were confused, like the sake served in western wine glasses. The server treated our sake like wine, requiring that I sample a taste before giving me a full pour. Weird. Decor is over done and we sat at the bar which had a nasty draft. This place reminds me of Chaya in that some things are really good, but the overall coordination of the experience is not there. Prices are harsher than they should be with appetizers at $12-19 and entrees around $30 (my special was suprisingly inexpensive at $22).', 'According to our waitress, the name of the restaurant Ame (pronounced Ah-may) is Japanese for rain (hence the tear drop in the logo). I was very impressed with the food, service and decor of this place. I highly recommend the octopus appetizer and the alaskan black cod. Apparently this is the signature dish from the owner other restaurant Terra in St Helena. The dishes are very flavorful yet not too intense. The portions are just the right amount and the presentation is wonderful with a Nobu-esque feel. I also enjoyed the spaghetti crabonara -- generous portions of the dungeness crab meat in the pasta! I definitely going back!!!', 'I had dinner here last night. Since the emphasis is on seafood (most of which I allergic to) and the price is out of my budget this won be a frequent stop, although the bar seems nice. The menu has offerings raw/sashimi items, salads (most with seafood) and a couple of nonseafood options. The entrees are mainly seafood as well although currently there is a pork chop and beef cheeks option. I had the roasted beet salad w/mache and goat cheese and the duck ravioli (three) which to me had a made the day before taste but that could have just been the confit of liver that was part of the filling. Both were nice but nothing special. My entree was the spaghetti crabonara. Rich and creamy and filling. All three of these dishes could easily be shared by two people (the couple beside me were doing just that and I just a big eater). My dessert was the house special according to the waiter, warm chocolate cake w/sugar beet ice cream. I liked the ice cream better than the cake which for me was too sweet. I liked the warm crusty rolls served. My kaffir lime gimlet ($12) was nice. But as has been previously stated the cocktails are probably a little on the expensive side but not by much if you compare other places where you are getting fresh ingredients and quality liquor. The sheer curtains with alternating bands of solid black material do help shield you from the fact that youe on 3rd and Mission. The tables aren so close together that you need to be a twig to gain access. The hostess was explaining that the lights were set to be centered on each table so there enough light for you to actually see. It wood and stone and pretty much keeping with the hotel in general. My waiter was attentive but not intrusively so.', Slow service and just average drinks that were very expensive ~$14 each. I stopped by on a Wednesday night and the place was about 1/3 full of primarily older types (lots and lots of white hair). Bartenders had ridiculous looking uniforms. Bloody mary was one of worst i've had in the city (yes i know i ordered a bloody mary after 6pm - but i was craving one all day). They also had wasabi-soaked peanuts at the bar which i was excited about - but weren't particularly good.Only redeeming factors are:a) very nice decor. The place looked very upscale..b) very good selection of premium spirits. A dozen different types of vodkas gins, scotches, ports etc.. I may come back w/ my parents to try the food or if i was in the area.... But this place was nothing special... Though i would of course kill to live at the St. Regis, 'surprisingly not as good as I had hoped for...........the spagettini with crabmeat was a bit on the salty side and same with the special fish of the evening which was cooked in a lobster sauce...i would have the say the service was definitely not up to par with a st. regis standard..thngs lacked attention when they shoulde been and the worse is if your stomach cannot take raw stuff....i highly recommend you not eating there....I don think their stuff was fresh that nite....otherwise, down some sake....it might save the day.', 'An outstanding restaurant, including superb design, knowledgeable waiters, and awesome food. Of course, you will pay for all of this with your hard earned cash. Nevertheless, the food is simply superb, with flavoring on each dish that may be incomparable in SF.', 'My artichoke-and-bruscetta appetizer was outstanding. The scallops-and-gnocci entree was good too, though small and probably not worth its $25 price tag. I visited for a weekday business lunch, during which time there were many empty tables and the other customers appeared to be formally dressed senior bankers. I look forward to trying it again some evening in order to experience the hip scene described by fellow yelpers.', **Drinks and Decor only** But for those two: yumuna hamuna - a wine list that satisfied the urges of even the most discriminating budding sommelier, a wait staff that COULD be snotty but chose instead to be friendly and helpful and the most FABULOUSLY comfortable sofas and cushions... known to be bumping on a tuesday (it felt like prom with well dressed holiday party revelers coming down for some relief - liquid style :) my friend's knob creek manhattan was so tasty that despite the wine that was flowing he opted for another... and there's nothing like wasabe peas to keep a crowd happy. Great for groups - two enthusiastic thumbs up!, Service: A- Food: A Decor: B Dessert: A+ The decor is one step away from W hotel decor (discounting the misplaced huge pumpkin on the sushi bar). The appetizer is not worth your money. Tuna 5 is a very pretty showcase of different ways of preparing tuna. Unfortunately, the portion is way too small to fully enjoy the tunas. Chawan Mushi with lobster is a bit too watery (as stated by my Japanese colleague) but I have to applaud the chef's attempts to utilize lobster and sea urchin for the flavorings. Stick with the free bread with butter for your appetizer.! Main courses and dessert, on the other hand, are superb and well thought. Eel with foie gras on risotto is a risky project that successfully balances the texture of foie gras with fresh eel on the perfectly flavored risotto. Red wine braised wagyu beef cheek is probably the best item in the menu. The beef cheek is melting in your mouth and no knives are required. The pairing of the beef cheek with sweetbread cutlet and cauliflower puree is very well thought. Most dessert, with the exception of excessively sweet churos with super watery hot chocolate, is worth trying. Warm chocolate cake is nicely paired with sugar beet ice cream (instead of the typical vanilla ice cream). Frozen souffle with mango sauce and black sesame florentine is another of my favorite. The service is decent as the waiter knows the menu very well. Beverages are average with nothing really outstanding. In a nutshell, Ame is worth going to impress your dates and families if and only if you ignore the appetizer, cocktails, and the hideous gigantic pumpkin on the sushi bar. Expect to spend $100-130/person (tax, tips, spirit included), 'Excellent service, excellent atmosphere, excellent soy glazed cod dish. We had a large holiday lunch here and were given the star treatment, and impeccable service. Our waiter accomodated all of our needs, including asking the chef to add extra pieces to our appetizers so all could share. The food was EXTREMELY good, and I am not one to fling about that comment in this City. This place will soon be discovered as the true gem it is!', 'Damn! They really know how to make a great margarita here and the dishes are nice too. I will definitely be here again and again when I feel the need to have a special heart to heart with a really close friend.', 'I expected nothing less from the Terra husband and wife team. Exquisite cuisine that is inventive but not over the top strange. Combinations of flavors that can possibly work but do, eg. the matelote of eel and foie gras over mushroom risotto (very a la Terra.). Cuttlefish noodles to DIE for. Immaculate execution helped by a waitstaff that is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. The wines are very reasonable. My only small gripe is that their wine list is not well categorized and quite limited in choice. I plan to return until Ie tried every item on the menu!', fantastic food, simple but detailed & elegant decor (albeit the paintings were a bit strange) and immaculate although i hate to say it because the food is exceptional) a tad bit dull. as in absence of life, dynamic people etc. the staff was cordial and attentive. i appreciate wit and sarcasm at times, although im not sure ame would be the place. onto the food: the oysters drizzled with beurre blanc and salmon roe was divine. the duck raviolis were good, but did not blow me away. for lunch with a friend splitting an app, salad and entree, the bill totaled $55, more than i usually drop for lunch. stepping thru the st. regis door, im sure you know what you're getting yourself into. regardless, i will be back!, 'I am only reviewing the bar. It is fancy as hell and exactly how a great hotel bar should be. Based on decor, I would give this bar 5 stars but every single person there was wearing a suit, some guy next to me was giving a power point presentation to some other dude, the cocktails are $13, and an Amstel was $7.', 'reviewing the bar area only...nice comfy couches are a hard find i think in sf...open but somewhat corporate feeling. high prices but you get yummy wasabi peas and sweet almonds with drinks. waitstaff are very efficient but not warm. met nish here for a drink, sad about the pricey cocktails or else this would be a nice meeting place on a school night.', 'Ame Amazing!Brand spanking new SF resto Ame made a big impression on me the other night. It been a while since a restaurant made such an impression on me based on service alone - our server, Sean, was impeccable, wine steward Anani was really kind, and virtuoso GM Steven was all attentive. It helps that theye all been pilfered from the likes of Gary Danko, The French Laundy, and Charlie Trotter.But the food! DeLIcious, and, all-importantly, NOT THAT FILLING. In a good way, you know? Our meal was totally satisfying, but I didn feel like I had a brick in my stomach when I left. To the contrary, I was ready to paint the town...ame!Ok, so I should stop gushing now because it sort of gauche. But, Ie got to hand it to this place - theye a class act. Here what we had: Trout mi cuitTuna 5 (AMAzing)Burrata appBlack cod entree Chocolate cake w/ Valrhona chocThe Black Cod concoction is their signature dish and melts in your mouth. It served over dumplings which are, seemingly incomprehensibly, also fantastic. They also melt in your mouth, which means this dish is like the closest thing you can get to sex on a plate.To boot, I found a great new Chablis on the menu: the 2002 Jean Collet. One of the most aromatic Chablis Ie seen yet, and at $8 a glass couldn be more worth it. Would drink this every day if I could.It doesn hurt this all that Ame located in the St. Regis, which means you enter through the hotel sleek lobby before making your way to Ame in the back. I definitely recommend grabbing a cocktail or glass of wine in the bar first - it comfortably packed with interesting downtown types early Friday evenings. four star caveat: I only giving ame four stars because I think five should be reserved for those mind-blowing meals you will remember forever. Although this was not that, it was still amazing!', Despite the fact that I have had only negative experiences at the bar lounge of the new St. Regis - I can only sing the praises of Ame. I love the first courses at Terra, and was excited to try their new restaurant venture in SF. Every piece of the meal was superb - service, food (lobster wontons, burrata cheese w/ artichokes, black cod in shiso broth - all amazing!), and atmosphere. The service was amazing. Wine list is good, although we brought our own bottle of Schaefer. One of my new favorites in the SF restaurant scene. The only thing that wasn't amazing was the dessert - it was okay, but no need to save room., 'A trendy Japanese fusion restaurant. Ambiance is good and location is ideal. Drink list is good as well. However, the food is so-so, the Five Tuna starter was disappointing. Be ready to spend cash.', Overall we enjoyed our experience but were not overwhelmed with the food, atmosphere or service. We ordered the five tuna appetizer and found some of the tastes excellent and other tastes to be unusual. The pairing of the fish and other ingredients didn't always work for us. We both thought that a plate of sashimi would have been more satisfying. The other problem with our appetizer was that they gave us wooden chopsticks (yes, the kind you get from Asian take out which have to be split apart before using) ! We were perplexed that a restaurant of this caliber would use such tacky utensils. For entrees, we ordered the beef checks and the eel w/ foie gras. The beef dish was very good- the meat was very tender and flavorful. The eel w/ foie gras was not as good. It came on a bed of risotto that was a gooey mess- very heavy and rich. Both the foie gras and eel were well prepared- the accompaniments just didn't taste good. Our dessert was the warm chocolate cake which we found delicious. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable but he lacked a certain smoothness and confidence we expect when going to a high-end restaurant (entrees over $30, appetizers $15-$20). Can't say we'll be going back anytime soon as there are too many other high-end SF restaurants that would be a more enjoyable dining experience., oh ame-- you're so pretty! it was a late night. it was a weird night. we were all dressed up and ready to do some liver damage at Ame. we had attended the ballet earlier and first rushed out to the mission to meet a guy who is running our softball team. we drank beers in his garage and talked softball while cooing at his pet frogs.(seriously) finally, we made our daring escape and headed straight to Ame. we pulled up in front and the night began....lets just say we indulged the way only Ame could indulge us. valet parking, perfect prime seats in front of the long fireplace, pricey cocktails topped off by free fernet shots compliments of the cute bartender. ah, a strange but perfect night. ame is THE place and i think i've found my new home., 'Took the opportunity to try the latest and greatest in the food mecca of the world. Ame did not disappoint in either food, decor and service. Ame reminds of what Aqua was 5-years ago....a great high end seafood restaurant. Ame is pure Asian/Californian.I had the Alaskan black cod with sake and my old UCLA schoolmate had the scallops. The Japanese inspired western dishes is a welcomed departure to the high-end French restaurants in town.Price as one would expect is on the high side but appropriate for what it is. Location is convenient to MOMA, Yerba Buena & Metreon and yet close enough to the Financial District for that very important business lunch.', 'I was at the St. Regis Hotel attending the SFJAZZ Gala which was held upstairs. But I could not pass up the opportunity to order some small plates at Ame to sample the menu despite already eating dinner early at the event -- I am know I am such a pig. The Tuna Five and Poke was awesome! I luv tuna and the sashimi bar did not disappoint. I will definitely go back for a complete dinner soon.', I've got to say that I was a little disappointed at Ame. I came here because several people have recommended me. First off, I had a hard time finding the darn place. There is no sign from the Mission Street entrance. At least they were able to accommodate us even after we pushed back the reservation twice. We were seated right away. But throughout the night, our service was lacking. We had to flag our waiter down a several times. Our waiter even told us at one point that he had to help another table out first so to hold on a minute! We might as well have been dining at Mel's Diner!I give them two and a half stars because I think that they deserve another chance. I've heard too many good things about them to give up so soon. And the food was pretty good. Not superb, but good. I had the special of the day, which was the American Kobe beef done med-rare with a light salad on top and finger potatoes. My mom had the Grilled Hokkaido Scallops, Cuttlefish and Lobster Tail with Lemon Garlic Parsley Butter. She really enjoyed the plate but one thing that our waiter forgot to bring to the table was bread. She really wanted to finish up the sauce with it but it did not come to our table once. The only reason why I would come back here is to try the Sashimi Bar., 'I went to Ame Friday night on a dinner date....As I sit here and try to pinpoint my experience, I remember 2 things....an elegant entry and tables for 2 that were too large...I know that seems surprising, but my date was so far across the table it would have been hard to hold his hand if I wanted...and we are both tall. I found the restaurant had a little stuffier vibe than the lobby/ cocktail area of the St Regis.Then for the food, I was super excited to try the restaurant out because I had eaten apps in the Hotel Lobby previously that were delish. I was a little disappointed with the restaurant itself. I mean the food was good, but not phenomenal. We started off with the 5 tuna appetizer. I only thought 1 of the 5 had any flavor...the rest just seemed like you regular sushi. My cod was delicious and the bread was amazing, but for the price tag, I thought it left a little to be desired. I will definitely give it a second chance...I may just stick to the bar and eat the appetizers.', 'Reviews in 7x7 and San Francisco magazine were on point about the food at Ame. We went with the recommendations and then some. I can remember some of the dishesnames, so I hope this helps.  I recommend the...appetizers: Baked oyster appetizerTuna FiveJapanese Egg Custard Chawan MushiMain dish:Broiled Sake Marinated Alaskan Black Cod and Shrimp Dumplings In Shiso BrothI gave the beef cheek dish a shot, but it was too fatty and overwhelming in size, although the tempura sweet bread was unbelievable. The desserts were adequate. Service was the only flaw of this restaurant. It wasn up to the level of the food and the location and for some reason, one of the hostesses was staring down my lady. Weird? I sure they worked out all those issues by now.', lions and tigers and bears.....oh my those are huge paintings on your walls. It's actually tigers and runners and rabbits and random angel beings, but non the less impressive. This dark wooden paneled lair with huge glass windows and a nifty fireplace, reminds me of a fancy ninja dojo, but the valeted cars and swanky guests remind me I'm in a hotel lobby. A nice, new one, right next to SF MOMA. It's big and fancy and yet somehow stylish and warm, The W needs a redux., 'A wonderful dining experience! We were treated to some amazing flavor combinations. Clearly the cheff is very dedicated. It is a bit pricey, but that includes some of the best service I have had in this city. Only desserts left us a bit wanting. The offerings were not congruent with the flavors of our dinner.', 'Hit and miss.When you spend close to 4 bills for 3 people to eat, you expect a flawless meal. We had some dishes that were fantastic and some that were barely average. The Staff Dinner appetizer was amazing - sea urchin, quail egg, cuttlefish noodles, and other interesting ingredients all mixed together into a VERY tasty texture roller coaster. The tuna 5 was decent, but not great, and my entree, the halibut, was bland and flavorless.I enjoyed the meal, and the service was excellent, but I wouldn go back and wouldn recommend Ame to a friend.', I'd like to give 3.5 stars, but since I can't and I have no desire to go back to Ame anytime soon, I'm going with 3. I was really looking forward to going to Ame because I had one of my best dining experiences ever at Terra, the chef's other restaurant in St. Helena. For those with similar hopes, I want to say first off that this restaurant is a total 180 in terms of ambience and atmosphere. It felt too glitzy for me, a lot of black and white and silver, fancy cocktails with prices to match, and dishes that seemed to focus more on presentation than quality. This is not to say that the food wasn't very good, because it was. It just wasn't spectacular, and for the prices they're charging, that's what I expected.For appetizers, we ordered the Tuna 5, which was really good, and the Japanese lobster egg custard, which really wasn't all that. It was nothing like traditional chawanmushi - very watery, more like a soupy bland custard.Our entrees were the signature alaskan black cod and eel & foie gras. The cod was very good, but nothing spectacular. The eel & foie gras was really yummy, but hey, most things that include a slab of seared foie gras are bound to be pleasing.The other thing that bothered me was when the sommelier came around to show us the wine list. I asked him to recommend a riesling, and he pointed out the most expensive bottle on the list without giving any reasons, except that it was the best. I then asked him which one he would recommend second. Yup, it was the second most expensive riesling. I'm sure those probably are the best two, but it'd be nice to get some options so you don't feel bad about going with a cheaper one! Anyway, the food was very good but not great. It's worth the drive to St. Helena to get the real deal at Terra next time., 'Big YUMS up to Ame. My husband and I decided to celebrate our anniversary there. Since we made our plans relatively late, our only option was to dine at the sushi bar -- which isn really a sushi bar since they don serve sushi. I made my intentions known to the host at 5:30pm that I wanted two seats at the bar at 6:00pm. My husband was at Remede Spa upstairs and took his sweet time to come down. At 6:10pm, the host came to find me at the lobby bar and encouraged me to hold my space at the sushi bar -- he was concerned that I lose my ability to dine there should my husband be delayed even longer. (I thought that was rather kind and thoughtful.) When my hubby finally showed, we had an AMAZING meal. The sushi bar served the entire menu and is on a first come first serve basis. I highly recommend their signature entree -- miso black cod. Ie had plenty of miso black cod before but this was served in a light broth with shrimp dumplings, spinach and mint! The miso didn overpower the fish as is the case in many places. My husband had the osso buco and it too was perfectly prepared where the sauce brought out the flavor of the meat. Ame is definitely a restaurant that exudes a level of great culinary discipline and skill. The ambiance was modern and sultry. And to top off the meal, the host served us our desserts with the words Happy Anniversary written in chocolate across our plates. We definitely appreciated that extra personal touch.', 'They kept us waiting for almost 30 minutes after our reservation time, without so much as a sorry for the wait. The service in the dining room was awesome, and the atmosphere was great. The food, alas, not so much. Our favorite items were the sashimi/crudo offerings (although my husband says parts of his fish were actually off). The food got worse as we progressed down the menu -- appetizers were good but not great, and nobody really liked their mains. Desserts were all-out bad. For the price, I expected a lot better. We spent almost $500 including tax and tip for 4 cocktails, 2 bottles of wine, 3 sashimi/sushi dishes, 3 appetizers, 4 mains, and 2 desserts.', 'Love the St Regis so I guess by default I love Ame. Good drinks, cool fire wall, and cozy atmosphere for those foggy SF nights. The rooms here are pretty sick and would be pleasing to any luxury-loving guest visiting town.', I went here for lunch about about 2 months ago. The menu has changed since then, so I'll try to remember what I had. Since the lunch was only about an hour long, we didn't order any appetizers. For the main course, I had a risotto with grilled asparagus and scallops in a lemon-butter like sauce. The sauce was wonderful and the scallops were tender but too soft. For dessert I had a mango sorbet with a toasted pepper thing on top that I can't, for the life of me, remember. The mango sorbet and sauce was excellent, but the toasted pepper thing did not go with the soft texture of the sorbet. It made eating the dessert very awkward. Instead, I took the pepper crusted thing off and just ate the sorbet. I would give the place five stars (for lunch), but the service was horrible. It was clear to the wait staff that we were going to spend a decent amount of money, but they were not very attentive. When we wanted to order more wine, no server would come to our table. When we asked to look at the the appetizer menu for a second time, they never geve it to us. When we wanted dessert, we had to wait about 10 minutes before anybody served us. We had to beg for them to serve us dessert. Overall, the food compensated for the bad service., 'Cutting edge cuisine. My favorite was the octopus and chorizo salad. A little pricey but worthwhile for a special occasion.', 'I didn think Ame could live up to the hype. But it did. Aside from a slight glitch where we were seated 25 minutes late, the evening was perfect. We ordered three sashimi appetizers and went family-style...one order of halibut ceviche wrapped in radish (quite good), one order of kampachi carpaccio (unbelievable) and tuna five ways where they presented tuna sashimi in five distinct ways. Two of the five weren particularly appetizing to me, but the presentation was pretty stunning.We opted for sake instead of wine, and the menu (and waiter) were quite helpful in helping me choose, since I don know very much about sake. The wine list is a little thin but they make up for it with all the sake choices.For the main course, I had the seafood mixed grill of scallops, lobster tail and cuttlefish, all over leeks. Absolutely amazing. Also at the table was the most tender pork chop I ever tried, and an excellent osso bucco. The portions were well sized, unlike the appetizers which were a little small.Dessert was equally stellar. I had a coconut panna cotta in a passion fruit sauce which wasn too sweet and was perfect. There was also a chocolate caramel sundae thing that was quite good, and homemade donuts that were more like churros than anything else. Overall, one of the best restaurants Ie been to in San Francisco. The decor was great, the staff was very helpful and attentive, and the food was simply excellent. It not cheap, but Ie given up complaining about the price of food in this city.', 3 stars for the service.would return for the braised lamb, but would ask for a side of veggies b/c it got heavy towards the end and my pinot noir didn't help much. loved the yellowtail carpaccio but i'll try my hand at making it myself. the bread was freakin' good but i could just go to acme bread for that... warm it up in the oven for 5 min and you're good.ahhh, then there was the panna cotta.... worth every cent. dunno if i'd go for an entire meal but maybe for the dessert... nuts, and i was all excited., 'I had dinner here the other night with my partner and two friends of ours. The service, decor/ambience and especially the food were fantastic. I had tastes of everything we ordered, and no dish was less than superb. I loved the jackfish carpaccio and the pasta crabonara (carbonara with crab), and the wagyu beef loin with fried oysters was superb, as was the black cod. The food at Ame is quite distinctive, as well as exquisite. I think the decor in the restaurant is beautifully understated, although it can hold a candle to the drop-dead-beautiful lobby and bar area. We were seated near a window, and my partner (who was looking towards the window) mentioned that the sheer curtains afforded a bit too clear a view of the street scene outside -- a little more privacy would have been welcome. Our server fit the experience very well -- he read our group, realized we needed sort of minimal hovering and coddling, and he answered all of our questions about the menu very knowledgeably. The sommelier was great as well -- he actually enthusiastically recommended the least-expensive pinot on the wine list. Il go back, for a special occasion -- dinner for 4, with cocktails and wine, was $600, including tip, which to me is pretty major dough for dinner.', 'There a bit behind the times, aren they? stated my dinner companion as she noted that there were NO vegetarian options in either the Sushi or Main Entree sections. When asked about it the waiter said oh we could do a grilled vegetable plate O Hell NO! Behind the times is right, a vegetable plate of whatever we might have in the kitchen is the answer a restaurant in St. Louis gives a vegetarian in 2000. This is not the answer for a high end, well designed restaurant in downtown SF in 2006. They managed to accomodate me with a pasta plate that was well done, not too hard to do mind you, and it was served on one of the largest plates known to man. Our waiter, while friendly was a bit far away during the dining experience and a bit behind the time of the dinner. 3 trips for 5 drinks ordered at the same time. Removing the wine menu with out asking, needing to ask for bread replenishments. The only thing I think he was on for was folding everyone napkin when they went to the restrooom and given that there was such a lag time between courses, we had time to kill.The restaurant is nicely designed and the lobby is beautiful. I was particularly taken by the fire wall.My meat eating companions seemed to enjoy their food very much, lots of Fish. In fact the serve asked if I ate fish which was silly since the menu is fish heavy. If I could eat fish, I wouldn have asked.The bread was good, served warm and may be among the best bread Ie had in SF but it won draw me back any time soon.', 'I loved this place. We were looking for a place to eat before catching a movie at the Metreon (MI:3 was pretty good!) and just walked in. I was a little hesitant: any restaurant in a St. Regis has got to be pricey.First thing I noticed was how attentive the staff was. Service was terrific from the moment we sat down. We ordered the kampachi carpaccio for appetizer, and the spaghettini crabonara and kurobuta pork chops for entrees. All three we good, but my friend spaghettini was the best. I ate half of it when she went to the bathroom.The menu is pricey, but I ended paying just a little over a hundred for the entire meal -- plus a glass of wine -- and tax and tip. Not bad.Definitely worth a repeat visit.', So good I can't stop talking about it.We had the perfect opportunity to check out the St. Regis hotel & restaurant since my friends had gotten tickets to the Smuin Ballet @ Yerba Buena. So instead of going to the once OK but now overpriced and tired usual choice of XYZ at the W (ever notice that the worse a restaurant gets, the snottier the staff becomes, too?), we took a chance with Ame.SUPER sexy interior, like a well-dressed urban gentleman with better shoes than you and all of the right moves, and he smells good too.Extremely professional and gracious staff - from the hostesses who found room for us at the sashimi bar without my friends having arrived and without a reservation, to the genuinely sweet and efficient server, to the enthusiastic and informative sous-chef at the sashimi bar who took the time to tell us about the ususal and delicious preparation of some of the more exotic offerings. You could tell that the people of Ame were happy to be working there - it showed, and I could understand why.The 3 of us ordered 1 sashimi dish and 1 starter each, and shared all 6 dishes. We started with the Tuna 5, the Smoked Tasmania Ocean Trout, and the Ceviche - all tender, fresher-than-fresh, with excellent flavor and seasonings. Then we had the Lobster Chowder (loved the bacon flavor that added depth and smokiness), the Foie Gras Tortellini, (2 great tastes that taste great together) and the Soft Shell Crab salad (meaty crunchy savory). SO good! We kept switching dishes back and forth to go back for 2nd and 3rd tastings. I'm sure they barely had to wash our plates in the kitchen later - we cleaned them up pretty well! The presentation of each dish was gorgeus, too.This will be my next pick for a special-occasion dinner, and if I can work it, an overnighter at the hotel (hi, sweetie, are you reading this?). But if you don't want to shell out the big bucks for a full meal, just a taste is well worth it. You will feel elevated by the experience. Highly reccommend.UPDATE October 06: I was taken here for dinner by my very generous family in September. The service was impeccable. They accomodated my vegetarian brother very well and I sampled all of the 9 offerings on his plate, which were delicious. (Sean, go back!) It's great but expensive, so if I go back on my own dime it will most likely be to the sashimi bar again., 'Very disappointing. Way too expensive. Trying way too hard to be an uber-hip NY scene. Doesn feel current. Feels like a throwback to the 90s when fusion cuisine was big. Not a single vegetarian option! Uncomfortable, stiff and much too self-conscious. The waiter was inattentive and unfriendly. Our drinks were strangely inconsistent -- we ordered several kir royales at the same time and they all came out a different color. Fruit flies/gnats flying around our table (and we DID not bring these with us)!! Gross. The food was good, but not worth the $$, except maybe Lissa Staff Meal which was actually quite fabulous. Sounds kinda bizarre (a combo of cuttlefish noodles and uni and quail egg) but it was tasty. I only maybe come back if I were on an expense account (maybe).', some nice attempts @ creative food, some more successful than others.FOOD: ~i had the tuna 5, which was yummy, but the portions were totally tiny. they should know everybody shares tuna appetizer dishes. i had to ruin their beautiful presentation by hacking everything in half. ~i am dreaming about lissa's staff meal, which is raw cuttlefish noodles tossed w/uni, quail egg, & masago--get it b/c where else can u get that! ~both our entrees had lots of pesto, which i found to indicate a lack of versatility from the chef, u know, when everything's green. my lobster & the tomato confit w/potatoes was very comforting. ~since portions were small, still had room for dessert or 2. i was disappointed by the okinawan doughnuts, which were dry & crumbly, like a subpar malasada, & the coffee shake that accompanied it didn't quite make up the difference. (side note: get a malasada next time u see them for sale.) ~however, the rhubarb pie was yummy! not sure if that's the chef or the rhubarb.DRINKS: try the namazake, which is unpasteurized sake. we sampled the cheapest one first, which i didn't like. the 2nd one we tried was monumentally different, really quite amazing & fresh. could really taste the difference in quality. (general rule: never get the cheapest one when it comes to wine or sake.)SERVICE: our waiter seemed impatient to answer my questions. i tried to be extra nice, & i think he came around & would try to be courteous, but u can tell he's probably a dick in real life. & when he described the dinner special of grilled halibut, he said it came w/gnocchi. i asked how the gnocchi was (b/c gnocchi is hit or miss, right? if it's on hit, i love it.) & he was annoyed like, of course it's good. then my friend couldn't find any gnocchi in his dish. then the server apologized profusely b/c it was never supposed to come w/gnocchi in the first place. a little letdown there. everyone else was really nice.DECOR: it's all in the details here. love the curtains. love the nouveau fireplace in the st. regis lobby.ATMOSPHERE: my friend felt it was kinda noisy, & i did feel myself talking super loud to overcome the din.BATHROOM: as usual in hotels, it was outside of the restaurant. pretty nice except hideous floor tiles.OVERALL: guaranteed an excellent, classy meal. good for guests & power meals., 'I came here today for the first time and was impressed with many of their dishes. I ordered the sake marinated cod in shiso broth and it was delicious - it tasted so clean and simple which was very refreshing. Their desserts were also very delicious and well-thought out. They created a homemade crackerjack box with an elegant painted piece of chocolate at the bottom of it as a prize. Minus a half star for the sashimi dish we ordered as an appetizer - it was a little confused. The fish lay on a bed of avocado, grapefruit, olives and bonito flakes. There was just too much going on at once. Minus another half star for the waiter who was kind of aggressive about taking my order.', Went here for lunch today and it was lovely. I loved the decor and the service was excellent. Food was promptly made and brought out and truly delicious. It is very expensive, though, so I wouldn't be able to go here often., I had a delicious dinner here a few months back. Fancy food like this generally isn't something I'm accustomed to, so it was a total treat eating here. On the plus side, the service, wine list, and menu were all excellent. Especially the service. My meal (a mixed seafood plate) and appetizer (5 selections of sashimi tuna) were fantastic, well prepared and presented. But the portion sizes were way too small for my less than sophisticated tastes. The tuna appetizer was especially small, and couldn't at all be shared without the use of a scalpel (which was a shame, because 2 of the 5 were very tasty. food that tasty should be shared). The main course was on the smaller side, but not overly so. Very classy place, with very friendly staff. I'm sure that if you're going to eat there you don't care, but it is expensive., 'What they said about fab drinks, decor, service. 4 stars, because of the above, and a 5th because that giant, sepia-toned painting of athletes in the bar really starts looking like a PeeChee folder after 2 of their humongous, perfect martinis!', 'Heard great things about Ame before going and they were absolutely confirmed. Great cocktails, great wine list, and super fresh fish which made all the sushi style dishes really good. I had the miso cod for my main and it was superb... very Nobu-esque.My only criticism is that the atmosphere is very common... typical new hotel/restaurant feel... nothing special. Modern and nice, but nothing to note.', Atmosphere, food, service, everything was close to perfect. The space is modern and the tables are so well placed that you hardly notice that anyone else is around you- and that's a good thing. Had the lobster tail with hokkaido scallops and my gf had the sake marinated black cod- hers was heaven in your mouth. We shared the banana rum sundae with a chocolate monkey hanging off it- a really amusing touch in such a high end restaurant. Every detail in the food seemed extremely well thought out. The only drawback is the high prices, but after you eat you'll know exactly where your money went., 'I was already hyped for eating here especially when hearing personal reviews from friends and walking through the very nicely decorated St. Regis lobby. Ame is not as big of a place as I thought it would be. However, the decor, the service, and the place was overall nice which gives you and idea of what kinda $$$$ youl be shelling out. Il get to the food later. The only thing I didn like too much were the tables for 2. They were too wide or somewhat awkward or too small .. it just was not that great and added to the crowded 2 seated tables area.The food was ok to me. Maybe it was a bad day? It just did not measure up to what my friend hype was (and she usually not wrong about these things). I forgot what I had ordered -- (see not that memorable) -- but I remember it being too sweet for me. I think Il only go back here IF there are parties going on but otherwise, Il just walk by, smile and peer at those sitting at the 2 seater tables (yeah theye by the windows).', I love food. I adore raw fish. Foods with rich happy tasty sauces that I ponder licking my plate clean of - definite plus. Foie gras...I savior it when I see it, because it's just a matter of time until people who think 'modern' restraunts *must* offer veggie options will unfortunately kill it in time. Thick wine lists that recognize an existance outside Napa are wonderful. A wait staff that recognizes their place in a setting encompassing these things keeps the wonderful package all working smoothly.I don't think there's anything bad on the menu - the staff meal is awesome - next time I'll get two. Cod fish was great, pork chop was good, although my dining companion who got it wishes she had been a little more adventurous when she saw the rest of the table.As the second bottle of wine came, I began to ponder exactly how great it would be to live in the condos above, and wander down, oh, say once a week to feast on these tasty plates. Alas, I'll have to wait another few years before I can do that.Can't wait to find an excuse to go back. If you really appreciate great food that's well designed and perfectly executed, start planning your Friday night. Beware - it's not cheap. If you're of the pansy-ass tree hugger variety, go waste your money over at Greens., 'Ok, so maybe the fact that my dad picked up the check influenced my experience just a smidge. Nonetheless, if I could make out with lamb ravioli, I would have been necking in the corner last night. Good god this place is fanfuckingtastic. Your job for today is to find a rich friend who owes you a favor and go to Ame. Get the dessert that involves Cracker Jacks (yep, Cracker Jacks). You can thank me later.', Beautiful hotel, beautiful restaurant and I loved the desserts, especially the fruit tart tatin. I have to agree that the yellowtail appetizer could have been better. The olives totally overpowered the taste of the fish. I was pretty satisfied with the cod, but I felt like the marinade was a little off. The warm bread is a very nice touch. This is a great date restaurant...just don't sit across from each other at the tables if you're on a romantic date, since the distance is really far., this was our first stop in finding a great dinner venue for our company holiday party. we had to axe a lot of great restaurants due to the fact that we needed private dining for 40 people. that excludes a LOT of great rest in the city. pooey! i really wanted to go to michael mina, fleur de lys or gary danko. our first stop was ame. decor was okay, sleek and clean. since we didn't have any reservations for lunch and we were in a rush we got seated at the bar and ordered one appetizer and one entree. the CEVICHE was really good! wonderfully fresh and clean tasting as they get their ingredients from the farmer's market daily. the HOKKAIDO SCALLOPS were also very delicious but i believe there were only 3 on the plate. 3 for $23!!!! i would be shelling out lots of moola to get full at this place. other than this place being a total rip off and the vibe being a little stiff, what little food we tasted were excellent and if you want something non-alcoholic try the GRAPE SPRITZER....totally refreshing!! *the private room (fits 32 max) is created by wooden partitions at the end of the dining area. due to the lack of room and snooty factor, we'll probably pass on this place for our holiday party but wouldn't mind checking it out for lunch or dinner. honey?!, AME---ZING!! ---SECOND REVIEW 08/09/07It was almost one year ago that I stepped foot in AME. I read my review from one year ago and can only tell you this place has become even better. After much prodding about what I wanted to do for my 40th birthday I chose to have dinner with some very close friends at Ame. And a perfect choice! First the lobby of the St Regis hotel is very inviting. It is buzzing with the sounds of happy beautiful people enjoying amazing glasses of good wine and signature cocktails. Although we didn't spend time in the lobby bar I did make mental note to come back another time and be one of these fabulous people.Ame has a great open kitchen that you must pass on your way to being sat. It gives you a sense of confidence about your up coming meal. Any restaurant that wants you to see the kitchen at the entrance must be confident themselves as this is where it all happens. The restaurant is L shaped which to me lends to the ambiance. It helps to keep the noise level contained. Surprisingly even with the open kitchen and the very full restaurant you didn't have to shout across the table.Our waiter was amazing. He was very knowledgeable and confident about his menu. Without hesitation he answered all of our questions to put us at ease about this beautiful menu. The food is Japanese in style and to me had a bit of a twist. For instance one of the people in our party ordered the squid bologonese. Who would have ever thought to put this Italian twist on Japanese food. It was amazing! There were five in our party and all five raved about what they enjoyed that evening. Please do yourself a favor and go to Ame. It is a perfect place for a special occasion but who needs a special occasion to enjoy life and good food! NOT THIS YELPER!8/15/06 REVIEW BELOW: Amazing just amazing! I was very happy about the distance between the tables. You did not feel on top of one another as you do in so many new restaurants. We were there for my birthday and the waiter was so good. He was very attentive without being on top of you. Three hours went by before we knew it and we did not feel one bit of pressure to leave the table. I especially loved the dessert with the cracker jacks. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant., I'm actually giving it a 3 and a half stars.My husband and I went here for Valentine's Day when Ame was relatively new. The space is very impressive. We arrived early and had the chance to enjoy a pre-dinner cocktail in the St. Regis lobby, which is absolutely gorgeous. The crowd that night appeared to be fancier business-types (not the Silicon Valley blue shirt/khaki types; more the European nice suit types). The restaurant carries on the sleek, luxurious look of the rest of the hotel. The food was less impressive. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty amazing -- but given the hype going on in some of the reviews I read, I thought we were going to the second coming of NYC's Le Bernardin. Le Bernardin it was not. All the dishes were impeccably presented and the seafood quite fresh -- but there was always something that made it just a tad underwhelming.It kind of reminded me of my dating days, when you'd go out with somebody who was so great on paper, looked great in person, even seemed capable of great conversation...but for whatever reason, you didn't quite connect.Next time, I'd probably just meet at the hotel bar for some martinis.Bottom Line: A great meal in a fabulous environment, but not a love connection., 'We had such a wonderful time at Ame my first visit there. It a beautiful setting. We been dying to check it out. And we wandered in spur of the moment on a Thursday night before an event at SF MoMA and were able to nab seats without resos. I had some fantastic sake - my favorite, so major points right off the bat. Our favorite thing we ate was the Tempura Poke with Ogo Seaweed, Hawaiian Sea Salt and Green Onions. We also had the sashimi three ways, which was great, but nothing that changed my life or anything. The Broiled Sake Marinated Alaskan Black Codand Shrimp Dumplings In Shiso Broth was fantastic, but honestly, my Black Cod Nobu-style is just as wonderful. Ie only been back for apps and cocktails in the lounge since, but there are a lot of things I still eager to try, so I looking forward to another dinner here!', 'I tried this place earlier this year, but since I just wrote a review on the hotel, I might as well be complete and do the restaurant as well!!! The interior of the hotel is like an upscale W or Ian Schrager hotel. Definitely more elegant than a W Hotel. I like their idea of a fireplace - a long thin line of fire. It turns off when it senses motion close to the flame. So no chance of self-incineration, but don let me stop you trying! As for the restaurant itself, I not a big fan of the high ceiling, geometric space, as I prefer the pairing of high ceilings with open plan environments. So..to the food - it pretty darn good. The best dish we had was the cuttlefish noodles tossed with quail egg, wasabi (freshly made) and sea urchin. It was a wonderfully refreshing dish. The tuna five-ways was a fun twist, but not stunning, and probably something to avoid if you are hungry - it along the scale of 5 petit amuse-bouche. After that we had burrata cheese with spring vegetables - for those of you who haven heard of this cheese, you can buy it wrapped in cane leaves, and is a beggar purse comprised of a thin layer of fresh cow milk mozzarella cheese stuffed with a mixture of heavy cream and stracciatella, little rags of mozzarella curds. It to die for, even if you are not a big cheese aficionado. The texture and taste is simply unique. For the main course, I had a grilled Sonoma Foie Gras torchon over eel, on top of a bed of mushroom risotto. It was a very smooth, suprisingly refined dish, but did not bowl over my tastebuds as much as the earlier dishes. My fellow diners had the halibut. By that time we had partaken in some quantity of fine victuals and were discussing slightly more titillating topics than food, so I can honestly recall if they said it was good, but they didn seem to have any issues polishing off their food.', 'I still riding on a high from the Dinner I had here last night...what an incredible experience...Everything from the Wine to the dessert to the service was flawless. I daresay my experience at Ame even over shadowed my Dinner at Michael Minna - it was that good! Walking into the St. Regis you are just struck by how well put together the entire establishment is from the fireplace that greets you upon entering to the unique murals on the wall in the seating area opposite the bar. The place speaks of class but it is not the over bearing, over done type of class that you experience at other establishments of this caliber. As you proceed through the lobby into Ame the first thing you notice is the muted lighting and the sleek, almost minimalist decor. Prior to going we had already perused the menu on-line so we minimized the amount time considering the menu a great deal - that said our waiter provided some excellent guidance on our selections and helped us decide on some of our provisional menu choices. In the end we settled on the Black Cod and Scallops with Lobster and Cuttlefish. In addition our waiter then made several excellent starter suggestions off of the sashimi menu - Tempura Tuna Poke, the Halibut Ceviche and the Tuna Kibbe. We were hooked (take your waiters advice on what is best - in our case it mapped almost 100% to what we were already thinking about having and we weren disappointed). A brief pause for some advice - Key things to bear in mind when ordering; don over order as the portions are appropriate and you have to save room for dessert as it is delicious...also consider yourself warned about the bread - I haven quite figured out what narcotic they bake into it (I leaning towards an opiate at this point) but not eating more than one piece was a very hard thing to do as the bread is magnificently crusty and delicious. After we made our selections from the menu we were engaged by the Sommelier and began to get down to the important business of selecting a wine that would bring out the best in our meal selections...The Sommelier was excellent and was able to pair a wine with of selections flawlessly (they even provided us with a taste of one of our two choices so that we could decide). In the end, we selected the Niedrist, Sauvignon Blanc, Alto Adige, from Italy...a very citrusy wine with hints of Grapefruit and Blood Orange - an incredible wine that I highly recommend although (try it quickly as they only have about 2 bottles left and it is was a small production run). From there dinner ran like clock work...the wine was exquisite and perfectly matched. The sashimi was delicious and unique - definitely not your run of the mill sahshimi. The main course was was excellent although I will have to say that the Cod beat out the Scallops - both were delicious but the Cod was phenomenal. After finishing our entrees we moved on to dessert - we opted for the Warm Gateau Au Chocolat with Caramel Ice Cream and Cracker Jacks along with a Warm Peach Fruit Tarte Tatin with Muscat Ice Cream. Both desserts were delicious however the Peach Tarte Tatin really stood out. The entire experience was incredible...I would definitely go again and I look forward to perhaps trying Ame sister restaurant Terra as well. Definitely a 5 star experience - food, service and ambiance were all top notch!'|1
6|aquavit-new-york|I've been here for lunch twice and it's great. Never been to the restaurant, only the cafe part, but the food is wonderful, if you like Scandinavian/Swedish food. Yes their Swedish meatballs are more $$ than Ikea but they are fab!, Aquavit has undergone some major changes, and the difference between the old, familiar spot and the new, highly stylized version is both striking and a little jarring. Considering how large it was in its former incarnation, the dining room now seems almost claustrophobic, but the cafe, once part of the bar, now has its own space, somewhat resembling an SAS airport lounge for frequent fliers. The Scandinavian cuisine with a contemporary twist remains excellent. An authentic Smorgasbord, served on Sunday from noon to 2:30pm, is priced at $39.00, and is probably the least expensive way to sample some of the outstanding dishes here. Weekdays, a three course prix-fixe lunch is $55.00 (vegetarian is $48); a three-course pre-theater menu, served daily from 5:30 - 6:15pm, is $55, rising to $75 after. The seven-course Chef's Tasting Menu is $100. Clearly this is a spot reserved for very special occasions only., 'Totally addicted to the Grapefruit Lemongrass Aquavit. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. The Prix Fixe lunch is pretty good without breaking the bank.', Since my first visit to Aquavit, Marcus Samuelsson (youngest chef ever to receive a three-star restaurant review from food critic Ruth Reichl) has become such a big star! I feel like I see his face everywhere now. His story of trans-continental/racial adoption is quite unique and figures prominently in the liminality of his cuisine. We got a great table at Aquavit, with a wonderful view of the cascading waterfall that runs down the wall on the other side of the restaurant. Our server made sure to let us know we had it for the entire night (important if you want to take your time on a multi-course meal). When we went, it was during Aquavit's Herring Week, so the fish figured prominently in many of the dishes. Here's what we ate: 1. Lobster roll with pistachio and lemon yogurt, salmon roe, and homemade ginger ale 2. Herring Plate served with Aquavit and Carlsberg beer 3. Squab with potato pure and pearl onions 4. Konbu cured duck and braised leg with nut salad, kasha, bok choy, water chestnuts, and coconut-red beet sauce 5. Smoked dry-aged New York Strip with Kobe tongue, lily bulb salad, and Japanese potato in bone marrow emulsion 6. Trio: sweetbreads, pork sausage, and lobster 7.Peanut butter parfait, sauted banana, and kalamansi sorbet (this was particularly exciting for us, as two of us are Pilipinas, and kalamansi comes from the Philippines!) 8. Arctic Circle: goat cheese parfait, blueberry sorbet, and honey tuile 9. Warm chocolate with orange creamsicle and citrus salad Can you say, WOW?, I'm not a seafood girl, but I'll eat seafood here! The best Scandavian fancy pants hang out hands down. Try the wagu beef ravioli, it's friggin brilliant. And check out the Festival of Santa Lucia night a couple weeks before Christmas. And oh, the aquavit (the swedish vodka) is incredible. Try a flight (3 shots) of cloudberry, lingonberry, and grapefruit lemongrass. Delicious! The new location isn't my favorite, but it's got Swedish style all the way. Check out the dining room, cafe or the bar. All quite fabulous. Scandtastic!, The cream of the crop in fine dining in New York. Marcus Samuelsson is a genius, blending Moroccan and Scandinavian cuisine into a culinary delight that is as much art as it is dinner. A relatively pricey restaurant, I find it is worth every penny. The interior is glamorously decorated, with the main dining room's high ceilings and elegant decor serving to complement the fine food. There is nothing bad on the menu, and you can be sure that you will remember your dining experience forever!The prixe fixe dinner and lunch options are excellent ways to sample the menu without demolishing your wallet, and participation in Restaurant Week is also handy, although I've never gone during that time and can't speak to the menu then!, ridiculously delicious. joins nobu on the list of dreamworthy food. i can't wait to go back. the herring is so good. as is the salmon. and risotto. and the arctic circle dessert is perfection on a plate. i'm usually so full but always order dessert and the arctic circle is perfect because it is not heavy at all but just right and so incredibly tasty so even if you're really full, i doubt you'll have trouble finishing every last bite of this dessert., haven't been for dinner but this place is *the* power lunch spot during the week... sedated suits and dolled up middle aged women fill the place. I come here for one dish - the smorgasbord - its incredible and a good value to boot., 'Not your Vita creamed herring in a jar. Their herring sampler in five different flavors was succulent. I wanted to go back the very next day to have it again. My second course of large portion of Swedish meatballs came with delicious mashed potatoes and snow peas. My dessert was a chocolate-peanut butter mouse. All this for their $24.07 prix fixe lunch. The service was okay; fortunately I was in no hurry.', 'I have a hard time saying more than Wow, but WOW.The food was awesome and they easily accomodated for my allergy.This is a must repeat for me.', Thank god for restaurant week 'cuz I don't think that I would have ever even thought about gracing this spot without it. I enjoyed Aquavit so much, that I would definitely return and actually pay the outlandish (but well worth it) prices. I had the Swedish meatballs (I know, not too adventurous, but I had never had them before and decided to try them at the best). Delicious! I'm addicted. I had never even heard of a ligonberry (very similar to cranberries) but now, I'm a great fan of them and have a jar in my fridge. The mash potatoes were a dream. Perfect!I think that what I appreciated most is that Aquavit exposed me to a brand new cuisine, and now I'm wide open and ready for more.Oh yes, I met the chef Samuelson at an event at the Studio Museum in Harlem. He was very gracious and cool., we were running late for a 2000hrs reservation. called up the place and the lady, issume the matre de, said she could only hold the table up for 15 minutes and then she would give it away. get to location at 2014 and get seated right away, at this point 5 tables and 2 booths are empty. reuest for a booth and she said we give it to parties of 3 or if you reserved for one before hand.i digress-- reserve and ask for a booth, if they dont have one, ask for table at the end of the restaurant- got the vegeterian tastaing as my date is vegeterian. - they do substitute some dishes form the tasting menu with the prix fixe menu. just ask- when the explain the dishes they try the foo foo accent but ask them to repeat else you wont know what ur eating- the staff was very attentive and kudos to their job on a sat nite..- don't go expecting a hip crowd and all, was a pretty conservative crowd ..- desserts - well find another location for it..., Sweedish fusion?! Now I've seen it all! I had a lovely walk-in experience here, the staff couldn't have been nicer and found us a table immediately, after explaining the difference between the restaurant's two sides. I've only eaten at the more casual side, but I really enjoyed it. I give Aquavit four instead of five stars not because of anything the restaurant does wrong, but because Sweedish food, overall, wasn't entirely my cup of tea. But if you've never tried it, this is the place to do it and if you are a fan, this'll be your new favorite stop., oh my lord, soooooo good!! I had heard great things from everyone I know who has eaten here, but it STILL managed to exceed my expectations. our waiter was so sweet, friendly and helpful, and the food was incredible. had the butternut squash/yogurt soup which was divine - the yogurt made it just perfect... swedish meatballs - tasty and flavorful, not to mention some delicious mashed potatoes! (my friend had the hanger steak, which I tried and that was AWESOME - I cut through it EASILY with my butter knife), and chocolate cake - very good but I guess you cant really go wrong with chocolate cake. even if you're not sure about the concept of paying $$$$ for swedish food, I say get thee to aquavit!, BEST MEAL OF OUR LIVES!Wow, wow, wow. From the second we walked in, to getting our coats on the way out we were treated like kings. Our group of four all had the 7 course chef's tasting and wine pairings. Absolutely superb--every single one. Yes, it's pricey, but stay in a couple nights to save up for Aquavit, it's worth every penny. Your taste buds will love you., Went to the Cafe on the last day of Winter Rstrnt Wk for dinner. Overall, the dining experience was pleasant. Very modern, chic interior with sharp (borderline dry?) waiters in pressed shirts. The food was great - def up there in my rating scales. I had the butternut squash soup (heavenly), followed by the VERY well done hangar steak (great sauce) and the chocolate cake with coconut sorbet to finish it all off. The dessert was the best part. The cake (though small) was rich and at its perfection, and the coconut sorbet... oh my. My dining partners very much enjoyed their swedish meatballs and the seared salmon. Why not the extra star? Well, maybe because we are not the regular $150-per-guest table, the service was not at its best. It was good - but not stellar. The hostess could've been a bit more welcoming as we stepped in (esp. given the weather outside which was quite horrid), and our waiter could've been a bit more personable. Also, the check came right in the middle of our post-dinner conversation - we definitely weren't ready to rush out.Given our fresh-out-of-college budget, the Restaurant Week was quite handy to try this place, but otherwise it's not something we'd die to go back - at least not for a while., Dinner at Aquavit - Both pleasantly surprised and somewhat disappointed.We ate in the main dining room and, while we did not get the tasting menu, our prix fixe selections were gloriously interspersed with small amuse bouches - which truly were wonderful.Before we even ordered we were brought the tiniest cup of butternut squash soup, and it was marvelous. Between our first and second courses we were brought a tiny round of fish, delicious, and a crisp with caviar - also delightful. After the main course and before dessert a waiter delivered an amazing warm soup topped with sweet cream - all decadent. The actual courses, however, were hit and miss. For our first courses:My date got the oyster/mussel plate and while the mussels were heavenly with a sweet green oil sauce, the oysters came topped with caviar that was so salty they were entirely overwhelmed. I got the foie gras - which I really shouldn't have, because I *always* get Foie Gras... and while the waiter was right, it wasn't like any foie gras I'd ever had - and was in fact very good: creamy, not at all gummy, truly rich - it was almost a waste as the butternut soup I'd just had previous was also creamy and therefor foie gras was not a great follow up. It did come shaped like a little tart however - cute. Also, it was accompanied by medallions of squab on the side which were just ok.For a main course he had halibut which was truly very good and topped with a creamy almost pesto or pistachio sauce.. His potatoes, however, where unappealing. My 'brioche crusted salmon' merely tasted like it was coated in lemon zest - and there was nary a touch of brioche to be seen. Crusted? hardly. But when it came to the veal cheeks that accompanied my salmon - they were succulent and delicious. I also discovered I am not a fan of beets!Finally, for dessert he had a sampler of ice cream - the coconut was amazing, and I am not exactly a coconut fan. The vanilla was actually fairly bland, and the blueberry was merely tart. I myself ordered the Arctic Circle which physically was not attractive as it is served as a cylindrical mass topped with a scoop of the same tart blueberry sorbet. I suppose we could liken the physical aspect of this dessert to something from Ikea. Again, the goat cheese parfait was dull, but the interior curd was tart, creamy, and exciting. It gave the otherwise disappointing dessert a much needed kick.I realize I should have tried the lobster roll, or the herring sampler (after all, is there anything more Scandinavian than herring?) - but I did get another glass of the glorious Lingonberry Aquavit, and all was right with the world., If you like seafood, you'll love this place. I had the tasting menu, so I can't speak for their dinner entrees, but from what I tasted, I can say the dishes are brilliant and eclectic. There's something for everyone. The duck breast in leek sauce is succulent, perfectly cooked...The lobster roll and seared tuna I could have lived without. I'd go here with the bolder, less typical dishes.I'd go for lunch. It's less crowded, and really lets you enjoy the high ceilinged spaciousness of it. Decor: a really elegant minimalism that sorta tells you where Ikea's founding motifs came from? Maybe?, 'I give this 4.25 stars. This was a new experience for me, having never tried Scandinavian food before.I ordered the calf-liver pate with lingonberry, and the smorgasbord (a sampler of traditional Scandinavian treats with 3 types of herring, Swedish meatball, oyster, shrimp, potato, etc). I never really liked meatballs before, but these were very good! The lingonberry was tasty and interesting (I guess lingonberry is only found in Scandivavia or something?)The food was definitely tasty and unique. Beautiful decor (very modern, all white and glass, very elegant), pretty good service.', Hands down the best dining experience I've ever had (also the most expensive). Try their Aquavit before you get seated. The first time was in the old space (with the waterfall) and I tried the pre-fixe menu. (I never thought roasted red pepper ice cream would be good, or THAT good.) The second time was for a 15+ course pairing menu. I LOVE the foie gras ganache and the grilled scallop. My friend wanted to marry the pastrami and cheat on it with the venizon.So go, walk out with a sh*t eating grin like I did, and slap down your credit card., It was good, but I don't need to go back... I love Marcus S. (last time I was in NYC and I saw him watching down the street from my cab. It was such a New York moment). But anyway, after planning to go here for a long time, I finally had dinner with a friend at Aquavit. It was quite good, but I don't know, I just wasn't moved... I think it was my appetizer? But my martini made with aquavit was awesome., 'A beautiful setting with calm lighting from the candles....the drinks were very memorable as their signature aquavit vodka is not as strong as the regular vodkas since it is made from potatoes. The food on the other hand was quite tasty...but when it came to dessert time, I think they couldve done better. So being at Gary Danko, we usually would rather have two appetizers rather than dessert if it is not to our liking...but this time, when we had ordered two appetizers, the way they brought out our food was soooo strange. When I was having my entree, my friends were having their second appetizer and when I had my dessert, they had their entree. What I thought they couldve done is at Gary Danko, they would either let you skip that course if you were not having the appropriate course or they would prepare a little dish of something to make everyone on the table be eating. I just think they should do something better with the service when situations like this occurs. Furthermore, the chef had to charge us an extra $10 for the 2 appetizers which I kind of thought was a bit ridulous. Perhaps he knows his desserts aren worth that much being choices of sorbets and fruits and fruit soups. I think they need to work on their dessert selection as well. The thing that I really enjoyed the presentation was the Herring Sampler....some was good but some were a bit on the strange side...but it was good cuz it came with a glass of ice cold beer and a shot of aquavit.', I'm a long time fan of Aquavit...so I'll always recommend that someone go to try out something a little different. ALWAYS go early and sit at the bar for an hour to sample the Aquavit. We had horseradish, a spicy mango, lychee, etc. The bar staff is great. The restaurant itself isn't what it used to be...the space that is. The new space is Scandinavian mod. The bar doesn't have the big jars of infusing aquavit, etc. I got the sense that...the restaurant changed hands recently. The food was good...there is a smoked salmon apetizer that was amazing. Aquavit isn't what it was in its prime, but still worth a try., 'An oasis of calm and relaxation in a very busy Midtown, the decor is soothing, the service is excellent and the cuisine light and unusual. One of the few place I enjoy a business meeting in Corporate Manhattan. It has become a bit more popular since they first open, so reservations are a good idea even for lunch, but make the call and try it. It will be an interesting experience or will become one of your favorite.', Please excuse the cultured response.... I swallowed a pearlI dunno.... I took some Swedish clients here last night and wasn't impressed.I ordered a couple smorgasbords for the table and mulled over some St Emillion to start. It was OK... I mean, how good can pickled herring be? And herring ceviche? Sorry, creme cheese shouldn't be in the mix.The bread was good though - You know.... that schmootzy flat bread crap...I then had the flank steak with mashed potatoes.....yum, but small enough to fit in the schnapps glass that followed shortly there after. The rest of the people had the snapper or the meatballs (how original) and all seemed to like what they were eating.The mid-town broker boys sitting next to us were all getting snookered on an array of fruity liquors and hollering Scandic chants followed by incessant imbibing so we figured we should follow suit.I vaguely recall trying all of their aquavit and fruit flavors before throwing up in the cab on the way home.All in all - total Swedish bumber, If you want cold fish for brunch, this is your place. The decor, while very modern and interesting, is certainly not inviting and warm. The Smrgsbord Brunch consisted of a variety of raw fish and roe, creamy sauces to go with them, and some breads. The warm items included a mediocre meat hash/potato concoction that lacked flavor. Does that sound appetizing to you? Maybe I need to eat dinner here to get a better assessment. Maybe I just don't like Scandinavian food. As a great lover of sushi, you'd think I would've enjoyed this meal a little more. Instead, I left dying for eggs, sausage and pancakes. Lucky for me I didn't have to pay the $45 a person price tag., I went to Aquavit Cafe during the restaurant week. The service was excellent, the decor impeccable, the dishware uniquely designed. But it cannot cover the fact that you are in a tight space with lots of people on uncomfortable chair with hard-to-use dishware. Appearance over function.I started with decor because the food was a forgettable experience. For $35 we got a meatball-based dinner. There was gristle in the bland meatballs! No, this is not the behavior of a celebrity chef, and the value of this place is half of what it costs. I'll do my looking at design dishware in MoMA., Aquavit is elegantly decorated. I was able to try out different flavors of vodka. That in and of itself was a learning experience. They offered more flavors than I thought imaginable. The horseradish one was not to my liking but it was definitely something I couldn't pass up., Great Scandivanian design aesthetic, although the dining room is a bit cramped for people to walk through. The brunch is a process - they suggest 3-4 courses, but it's up to you as you can decide if you want to follow the traditional smorgasbourg-order of food. I didn't, but was very happy and stuffed at the end of my meal. Fun experience, although I generally don't like to pay $50 pp for brunch, and I generally don't crave herring in the morning. Otherwise, the staff is attentive, the food delicious, and a nice change of pace from the normal eggs/pancake routine., Well today began my first day of my summer associateship at a large NYC firm. This means, fancy lunches at places I could not afford on my own. First stop: Aquavit. Definitely a good kick off to the summer. I don't eat seafood (read: shrimp and shellfish) generally so I missed a large portion of the menu. However it was still delicious. We all had the prix fixe menu (cost around $40) and I started with a mixed green salad with roasted pears. Always one of my favorites and it did not disappoint. Entree was a steak dish with a beer based sauce and vegetables. It was absolutely delicious--very tender and easy to eat. The portion was small enough that I didn't feel like a complete hog. Dessert was a chocolate mint mousse which was splendid. I would definitely recommends it for a nice business lunch. The ambiance was wonderful--very open seating and I did not feel crowded or like the next table could hear my conversation. The only reason I don't give a five star rating is because I don't have much to compare it to., Even though I've known of Marcus Samuelsson for many years and even seen him in person multiple times, I've never had the opportunity to try his food. So with this trip, I decided it was about time to try Aquavit. The restaurant is lovely. The decor is indeed very Scandinavian chic--Blonde wood, minimalistic design, soft lighting. We decided to dine in the Cafe up front, which was quaint and cozy, though a bit too quiet. Some soft background music would've been fitting. Another thing that distracted us was that the upholstery of the chairs--the fabric was scruffed up and scrappy in corners. These chairs definitely need to be replaced. Ok, enough diva talk. Let's get on with the food.We began our meal with appetizers: My friend Dar ordered the Shrimp Salad on Brioche and I ordered the Herring Sampler. The shrimp salad was refreshing and flavorful, but unfortunately the brioche toast was dry and tough. You could barely cut a knife through it. My herring plate on the other hand, consisted of herring prepared four different ways: Curry, Vodka Lime, Matjes, and Pickled. The flavor of each style was alright except the Matjes, which turned out to be very sweet and liverlike in texture. The sampler was decent but it wasn't fantastic. I don't think I'd order it again if I returned.For the entree, Dar ordered the Calf's Liver Pate Sandwich. It was a deconstruction of a sandwich on a plate. Each corner of the plate held a different item: pate wrapped in dark rye bread, a deconstructed potato salad, mixed greens, and a pile of Lingonberries. The dish was visually stimulating. Flavorwise, everything complimented each other well. Dar was pleased.My entree were the Swedish Meatballs served in a cream sauce with a side of mashed potatoes and a pile of Lingonberries. Oh boy, were there a lot of meatballs on my plate. So much food, so little stomach room! Everything tasted good, like homemade comfort food you'd get at a Swedish grandma's home. However, it wasn't mindblowingly amazing like you would expect at an upscale restaurant. Then again, what was I expecting? Meatballs filled with Foie Gras and potatoes swirled with truffle butter? Is that too much to ask?!? Don't answer that. :oPEven with all that food, we still managed to squeeze in dessert. Dar ordered the Arctic Circle, which was a frozen Goat Cheese cylinder filled with Passion Fruit Curd, and topped with a scoop of Blueberry Sorbet. I'm not a goat cheese fan so I let her do the eating on this one. She seemed happy with her choice. My dessert on the other hand, was the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake, which I liked a lot. The cake was a flourless cake filled with a scoop of creamy peanut butter. On the side was a scoop of coconut ice cream served over chocolate/coconut flakes and a shmear of blood orange concentrate. Indeed, an unexpected set of flavors. I particularly appreciated the blood orange. Like a gourmet Lifesaver, it was concentrated, tangy and sweet. Mmm...Even with the quibbles I mentioned above, I did enjoy the meal. I mean, you can't really complain much considering the meal was only $24 and it was on a Saturday. Can't beat that price for the experience., You know you will have a dining experience the minute you step foot into this restaurant. The frosted glass wall and the panels give the private dining area subtle controlled lighting. Seven in our group, so we were seated at a large table at the end of the hall, giving us quite a lot of privacy, unlike others that looked sort of squeezed in at tables on the other side. This made it all the more special, as we were able to have a relaxing 3 hr. meal. We seemed to always have wait staff closeby, and the service is top notch. We all had the $90 PP prix fixe menu. Everything from the amuse bouche to the unique desserts were wonderful. Unfortunately the main course was the disappointment. The steak tar tar had tendons that got stuck in-between my teeth. I have never had this happen before. The grilled Octopus was tough. It's very difficult to evenly cook a piece of Octopus that is very wide on one end and very narrow on the other, however these are obstacles one would expect that a restaurant of this caliber would overcome. I'll stick with Gary Danko, and still have some money left over., This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Of course, I can only afford to visit once or twice a year. It is very cool in a chic Scandinavian sort of way. The food--especially the fish--is delicious and plated very nicely. The amuse bouche are uniformly tasty and presented in interesting ways (how much do I love free food). Occasionally, you get something delivered on a little spoon. You just pop it in your mouth. Charming. And convenient. The drinks here are strong, which I appreciate, as I am Irish. Make sure to try some aquavit. It pairs well with the food, in case you don't feel like having wine. My only quibble would be with the overly formal staff. They can be stiff to the point of rudeness. I prefer a slightly more collegial tone, like that of the waitstaff at Gramercy, but that's just me., 'Aquavit was listed on my dining list. Now, it is on my favorite list. My first cousin and I picked this place for our family reunion to surprise my aunt and her friend. We enjoyed the simple, cozy yet elegant as walked into the restaurant. We didn have a reservation, initially led to the cafe area. Then I politely asked to see a manager on duty and mentioned about our aunt 23 hours flight to NYC and this was her first meal since arrival. 5 minutes later, he came back to invite us to the dining room and started our meal with amuse buche. We all decided to get 3 courses dinner and also order several herb and fruit infused Aquavit because it caught our attention as we walked though lounge area going to dining room. We saw big glass jars of these yummy color inflused Aquavit (Aquavit is clear liquor). I remembered two of my fav. Aquavit were Basil infused and cranberry. I got Foie Gras Ganache and could careless what my family member got. It was delicious. I remembered my aunt got nettle soup came with poached egg. After appetizer, we recieved a complimentary mid course from the chef . ( I doubt Marcus was in the kitchen that night). I got Black Seabass as my main course, my aunt cod was the best cod I have ever tried. My cousin went out his usual path ordering Venison loin, delish! Dessert was my second most favorite moment of this dinner. I got Goatcheese Parfait with Sorbet...tasty and cuttng edge presentation. I was so happy enough to get another flight of inflused Aquavit. Thank god I didn have to drive!!. Well, I can only say Marcus dishes and cooking style makes his restaurant a world class. It lives up to his reputation. My next plan is to travel to MN to visit my woman best friend and dine at the Aquavit there. I wish they sell those infused Aquavit for togo.....in a togo cup :)Aquavit is a must visit restaurant while visiting NYC or living here.', Another RW dining experience, and it was a good one. You never know what to expect from some of the participating RW restaurants, whether they'll be snooty and look down on you, or not even hand you the RW menu unless you ask for it. But at Aquavit Cafe, they were classy all the way! Everyone who attended to us was friendly, professional and accomodating. And they listed the RW menu right inside the regular menu, so you could peruse all of your choices.This was my first time trying Scandinavian food, so I didn't really know what to expect. I opted for the herring sampler as an appetizer because I was really curious. Hey, guess what! It's just like sushi, except dressed up in different costumes! I couldn't really tell you what all the flavors were, but I know one was definitely curry. All I know is, it was delicious and I could have kept eating it for the rest of the meal.But alas, I didn't. My main course was the Swedish meatballs. Again, I had never eaten this before, so i wanted to see what all the hoopla was about. Hey, guess what! They're just meatballs! Albeit, in a tasty sauce with mashers, some ligonberries (another first...like cranberries, but not), and pickled cucumbers (which I loved!). My plate had about 8 meatballs on it and I was starting to feel full after the 4th one. But then it was time to switch plates with my mom so I could try her salmon, which was good but not my preferred way of having it prepared (I like my salmon a bit on the well-done side).For dessert, we both had the Arctic Circle, which was a goat cheese parfait with blueberry sorbet. This is was one delicious dessert! The parfait was very chilled so it was almost like eating goat cheese ice cream. Who knew that would taste so good??I would love to come back to Aquavit and try more items from their menu, including the titular beverage. I'd also like to check out the main dining room, which is dressier and presumably even more classy. Guess that means I gotta get my fancypants pressed..., 'We just had dinner in the cafe during restaurant week. The room is nicely appointed with sleek lines and light colors. After seating us, the server brought out a bowl of popcorn that was compliments of the chef. Uh... Ok... Dude, its popcorn. Oh well, we rolled with it. We each got a flight of Aquavit, which tastes just like infused vodka. I tried the blueberry and elderflower, raspberry, and pear vanilla flavors. The flavor is interesting, but the net effect is like sipping on three double-shots all night. Interesting, but Il try one of their martinis next time instead.I had the herring sampler appetizer, which was interesting. I never tried herring before and found the chewy texture to be somewhat disconcerting. They prepared it nicely, with four small dollops of different flavored herring on the plate. If anything, it was nicely plated.We then moved on to the Swedish meatballs (of course!) with lingonberries and mashed potatoes. The berries were good, but I preferred to have them more as a sauce/compote like Borgas Chef. The meatballs were very flavorful and the mashed potatoes very creamy.Lastly was the goat cheese with passion fruit sorbet that tasted like a heavy cheesecake. Yum! Permission to unbutton my pants, please. After all this food, I gonna pop! Not bad for $35 prix fixe. Oh yeah, plus $35 for the Aquavit. And $5 for the coffee. Guess wee walking home.', go to the cafe for the lunch b/c it does not break the bank. see my photos. i loved all of my server's recommendations. the herring and meatballs were delish. the dessert was only ok. i'd definitely head back again. you definitely get bang for your buck!, 'OK, I have found reviews about this place right here on Yelp. Fancy, fancy, fancy. I had a business lunch with a client and was told that it is suggested for men to wear tie and a jacket. But once there, you realize that this is the place to be. The decorum is excellent, the atmosphere makes you feel like a million dollars, and the food is exquisite. It is a bit pr icy, for a prefix lunch ($39) I paid $120 for the bill. Lunch!But I will definitely come back to this place, because I absolutely LOVED it.Totally worth the money.', 'How embarassing! I took this hot chick out on a date here, and I got my man juices all over me! Swedish meatballs (or as they say in Norway, meehtballs) are THAT hot!!!', 'Scandinavian food confuses the hell out of me.When I was in the lovely country of Denmark a couple months back, I was really excited about trying traditional Danish fare. I wanted to eat the pickled herring in all its glory... I wanted to sink my teeth into the earthy meatballs... I wanted to ravage all the pastries in the world. And on my first day, I eagerly chose a sampling of smorrebrod: basically rye bread with stuff on top. After that meal, I realized why Danish food isn celebrated as an especially delicious cuisine. I can see how some would enjoy dry, hard, rye bread topped with salmon roe, shrimp, scallions, mayonnaise, and eel - oh, and bacon - but it just not for me.That being said, Aquavit is terrifically traditional. It falls in line with the Scandinavian way of mashing incredibly strong flavors together. I went for lunch and ordered the traditional Scandinavian prix fixe of the day (veal entree, rose hip soup and vanilla sorbet for dessert) and a smoked salmon appetizer. The smoked salmon appetizer was very good: fresh, not too salty, and the light whipped goat cheese went perfectly with the huskier espresso-tinged mustard. I sampled my coworker pickled herring sampler, and (somewhat unpleasant) memories of Denmark came screaming back. My entree was extremely heavy: a tender veal cutlet with mashed potatoes and some veggies, all doused in a rich, buttery gravy. It was tasty, but a little over the top. My coworker described his calf-liver sandwich (that came with that rye bread I mentioned earlier) as Well, it has many buttery, smooth morsels similar to foie gras... But then every other bite reminds me of my grandmother meatloaf. My dessert was wonderful: the rose hip soup had a little kick of cardamom and ginger. My coworker ordered the Arctic Circle dessert, which basically ended up being frozen cream flavored with goat cheese. Yeah. They also gave us the chocolate peanut butter cake on the house. It was rich and warm, and very strangely accompanied by coconut sorbet. Not just vanilla with a tinge of coconut, but full-on toasted coconut. As you can probably imagine, coconut + peanut butter = :ONot to say I was disappointed. Aquavit Cafe has a beautiful, spacious dining room with affordable lunch prix fixe choices (24$ for a three-course, 19$ for the two-course traditional Scandinavian fare that changes daily), and unpretentious, gracious service. And if I haven stressed this enough, it also very traditional..I probably won be going again, but I recommend it to those who haven tried Scandinavian food before. It definitely an experience within itself. As my coworker so aptly put it, eating Scandinavian food is similar to having a conversation with a Scandinavian person in English. The presentation and fluency is impeccable, but every once in awhile, there a pronunciation difference that just totally throws you off.', We had the Smorgasboard Sunday brunch at Aquavit.I give them A+ for authenticity. It was just like in Stockholm. Perfect.Great decor, super friendly service, food was tasty as hell. A little pricey for what you get, but for us Scandinavians, I suppose that's a small price to pay for a slice of home in the Big Apple.One thing though...the Sunday brunch smorgasboard is Scandinavian in the Swedish kind of a way. It isn't very Danish, Norweigian or Finnish really., i went here for a business dinner and after the clients were gone we still had a lot of expenses left to drink through and in the end we left around 2 in the morning, having drunk way too much aquavit. the food? it is really good, but i have no idea what makes it scandinavian (you could have told me my steak is american cuisine and i wouldn't have blinked). drinking options are amazing (definitely try the aquavits, but don't try the sweet ones, they will give you a headache). the wine selection is like most places like this in new york pretty good. and they also make a pretty good mojito. the decoration is great, i especially liked the lounge area in the entry hall. the only thing i found a bit odd were the waiters. first of all they weren't scandinavian, but french (and french they were)., This is another expense account kind of place... and it totally shows. Everyone in there looks like they just got off work at an I-bank or hedge fund, or they look like someone's rich wife. The food was good - definitely not what I would imagine Swedish food to be... a lot of Asian influences and even some Southwestern touches. The service was good, but this place was definitely a little too stuffy for me to choose to go here on my own dime., The best (and probably most expensive) lunch I ever had. Curried cauliflower soup with raisins and capers, barley risotto with orange foam, grilled asparagus, grilled lamb, halibut steak, brilliant wines, and their famous arctic circle for my date and a chocolate hazelnut mousse for me. Marcus came out to introduce himself, and the overall experience was just perfect. If I had a bottomless pocket I'd be here every night., 'marcus samuelsson has a true winner with this fabulous restaurant. the food is amazing, drinks are good, staff is polished and very helpful. no other words to describe how wonderful this place is except to tell everyone to try it!', (i dedicate this review to my favorite swede- anders l.)seriously the best meal of my life was here. we ordered the chef's tasting menu, and oh my god i have never been so satisfied, wowed, charmed and excited. in one evening i consumed duck tongue, steak tartar, raw scallops, venison steak, a herring sampler... and not one thing failed to knock my socks off. we tried about half a dozen aquavits, some were better then others but definitely something that should be experienced.we were there on a weeknight and the restaurant was filled with wall street big wigs and uber professionals, so basically me and my man stuck out like sore thumbs in our jeans and wind blown faces, but the wait staff was incredibly sweet, patient and helpful in spite of our faux pas. they even brought out a special dessert just for us! so a note to californians, this is manhattan play by the rules and dress accordingly.the piece de resistance was being sent home with a box of the most delicious speculaas cookies that were promptly gobbled up the next morning in bed while nursing our aquavit hangovers... if you have the pocket change, here's where to spend it!, I finally got to Aquavit for Restaurant Week! And it was worth the wait. It's not often that a restaurant impresses me so much that I want to come back the next day and the day after and so on. Aquavit is one of those places.I came with a friend for RW and between us we had the herring sampler, the butternut squash soup the (hangar?) steak and the Swedish meatballs. Oh, and the chocolate cake. Everything tasted wonderful. Really, really wonderful. I loved my meatballs and loved the lingonberries and the soup was excellent. I tasted my friend's dishes and they made me as happy as they made her.One thing, though, don't get the chocolate martini, it's not worth it.The space is lovely and the waitstaff very attentive. I would not hesitate to come back here or to recommend it to friends.Oh how I wish Restaurant Week happened more often, then I could afford Aquavit! Though, honestly, the regular prices are not so very prohibitive. Think upscale but not crazy trendy., Went here for restaraunt week and ate in the cafe. Been wanting to try Marcus Samuelsson's signature place for a while. There was a weird game show on the food network years back hosted by some horribly perky woman named Sissy Biggers where people had $10 and 30 minutes to cook a meal, but paired up with an awesome chef like Marcus Samuelsson. Anyway, I've eaten at Riingo and the AQ Cafe in the Scandaniva House, so it was a treat to finally go here.Really nice setup in the cafe- for lack of a better comparison, think of the nicest room in Ikea, but sleeker. Really nice Scandanavian style- solid colors, wood tables and tan/coffee colors. Cool place.Started out with a little popcorn amuse. Supposed to be flavored with dill and a Scandanavian cheese of some sort, but it was fairly plain. The first courses were very impressive however. The herring plate came with a pickled version (the best), matjes (red onion and sour cream- very good), vodka liime ( a little too fishy) and ceviche (decent). Butternut squash soup was otherworldly- one of the best versions I had. Not too heavy on the cream and a great smoky flavor from the chorizo.Main courses- Smoked Salmon with dill potatoes was very well prepared, if a little restrained. Swedish meatballs here are terrific- though I like the less refined version at AQ Cafe with more gravy.Deserts were terrific. The Artic Circle is a must.Real nice place. I'll stick with my regular visits to AQ Cafe, but the Cafe Room at Aquavit is priced pretty reasonably and is defintely worth a visit., This place is kind of mixed for me. The smorgasboard dish I had for $19 was fabulous. Just little bits of different types of herring (no warm things on this plate), and it was flavorful and gave me a bit of everything. Would give it a 4 to 5 stars. Got the meatballs for a main course, they were pretty bad. Around 2 stars. They were super dry, the mashed potatoes were very standard, and there was really no sauce. It would have been nice if the ligonberries had more of a sauce on it, but the meatballs just didn't cut it.My friend had the steak and it came out really rare. The waiter didn't even ask us how she liked it done. We were too scared to send it back to get it cooked.So the ambience was very nice, open, and swedish. Starter was popcorn with some dill and sugar and maybe bits of cheese. Would have been a 4, but popcorn tasted stale.Bread and butter were pretty good. Dessert was goat cheese parfait: 3. Just too strange. I don't like goat cheese at all, but I ate the dessert, but it was just wierd, not tasty.I would go again for the smorgasbord but not anything else., This was my first time trying Scandinavian food, and I was pleasantly surprised. I had the lychee and orange blossom aquavit (scandinavian vodka) which was floral and fruity with a touch of sweetness and my friend started with a kir royal which was delightfully citrusy. As an appetizer, I had the herring sampler: pickled herring with horseradish, herring with curry and green apples, and vodka lime herring with salmon roe. Each had a complex flavor that was salty, sweet, slightly smoky, with it's own combination of flavors from the different marinades. The gravlax with espresso mustard had a surprising flavor that married well with the salmon, which was neither too salty nor too aggressive. In terms of the entrees, the beef tartare was flavorful, pleasantly cold, and served with freshly toasted baguette slices and two sauces. The venison was tender and perfectly cooked, with sweet, crunchy sunchokes, large earthy pieces of mushroom, swiss chard, and ligonberry. It was slightly gamey, with a melange of deliciously complex flavors that made you want to take another bite to figure out how each flavor played off each other.The goat cheese parfait with blackcurrant sorbet and passionfruit sauce was absolutely delicious. The parfait was firm but slightly creamy, with a sort of passionfruit paste in the middle. The sweet passionfruit, slightly sour sorbet, and savory parfait made it the perfect ending to the meal. The chocolate cake with candied beets and vanilla yogurt ice cream, however, was somewhat of a disappointment. Each element tasted good but did not seem to go well together. The chocolate cake was also slightly too dense for my liking.Despite the deliciousness of the meal, the service was cold. Our waitress seemed annoyed when we needed a little more time to look at our menus, and she gave us our check before our dessert even arrived. She never once smiled, but instead had a constantly grouchy look on her face., 'For those of you who thought that Scandanavian food consisted mainly of gravlax and lingonberries...you were more or less right.BUTMarcus Samuelsson is a fine ass Ethiopian born chef who adds about every Old and New World spice to traditional dishes.And he can curry me anytime.yum.', The first time I came here was for my 18th birthday. This place was amazing and the service is terrific. I booked the private room to host 10 of my closest friends. Although I wasn't able to get any alcoholic beverages, they specially made two drinks for our group to try (little did I know they were $11 each but that's besides the point).About 30 of those drinks later, I treated all my guests to their tasting menu which is superb. I'm vegetarian and even though I only had the vegetarian tasting menu, it was so yummy and I would go there again. By the way, their princess cake is probably the best birthday cake I've had. What I like about this place is that they're quite accommodating. I went here another time with a friend (just for an excuse to dress up for dinner) and she was allergic to mint and horseradish and we were each having tasting menus. The chef actually changed the items on her menu, even though they would generally never do that! Actually, now that I think about it, they might have been slightly perturbed by the fact that she wanted something else on the tasting menu-- but at least they were really nice about it. Its definitely worth it to try this place out!, I'm semi-obsessed with all things Scandinavian so Aquavit clearly fits the bill, but I have to admit that the android waitstaff was a bit of a turn off. To be honest I don't remember the food. I'm sure it was good. What I remember most was thinking that if my dad weren't paying for the meal, I'd probably come back and eat at the bar. Swedish Meatballs at the bar were like... $9?? Reasonable pricing, just as fancy atmosphere, no androids. Score., 'If there is 1 word that sums up this place, it would ANAL with a huge capital A.I came here for a business dinner and we were in the special conference room which was great. Sometimes it wonderful not to have to jostle with people at the next table.The food wasn very memorable. I had a venison entree which was arranged beautifully but everything was just FUSSY, FUSSY, FUSSY. The waiters were stiff and rigid. Banter clearly wasn on their horizon. They stood at the corners of our room much like Victorian butlers.I can just imagine someone laying down these arbitrary rules about what is permissible there and what is not in terms of service and food. I think it interesting that this was the only place where the rigidity of the food and staff added up to a very so-so experience for me. I don think food needs to be so serious and regimented as they do it here. Perhaps it just my take on food but I don think I come back here....', 'Smorgasbord! Smorgasbord! ...what a great word. My boyfriend is Swedish so we find ourselves at Aquavit regularly. The cafe is my favorite as the vibe is a little more relaxed and prices are very reasonable. I HIGHLY recommend the Smorgasbord, especially for anyone with food ADD. You receive a large plate with samples of restaurant favorites: herring sampler, gravlax, tuna tartare, shrimp salad, even a meatball with lingonberries. YUM!Cocktails are tasty. Wine is good, too.', This place is to die for! It's one of the best restaurants we have ever been to. Their ability to fuse New World elements to make simple food like fish juicy and succulent is amazing. The herring sampler (with curry, ceviche, vodka lime apple) was truly memorable not to mention voluminous and went perfectly with the Carlsberg beer they provided during and the aquavit to down after. Lobster roll with egg dressing and trout roe was juicy. The purees our fish entrees (halibut, trout) sat in infused perfectly to hit the right taste buds.The Scandinavian feel in the Dining Room with clean minimalism and wood decorations is quietly sophisticated. The size is perfect, so a 70% full room is mildly festive and not too loud. As expected, the crowd is older (2/3 above 40) and they tolerate casual dress.Only negative was wait staff that didn't smile much and were late filling up our wine glasses a couple of times, but he knew his menu perfectly and explained odd items clearly and succinctly.The aquavits aren't as strong as we feared they could be, but baijiu from China is 80-120 proof, so a hard comp., 'I wish I knew Scandinavian food better. I would have ordered off the Prix Fixe menu, then. Instead, I got the Chef Tasting.The food was fresh, but I thought the food execution and flavors ranged from acceptable to yum. I didn really get to Wow at any point during the meal. (Everyone at the table loved the lobster roll, but I was thinking, It lobster and bacon! That practically cheating for a high end restaurant! I also think the lobster could have used a little less cooking time.)When you order a Chef Tasting, you get half the menu, and your dining companion gets the other half, so we switched plates throughout the meal. I think this is great in terms of portion sizes, but I find it a hassle when I have to trade plates for so many courses (i.e. Hatfield in LA).I also ordered a flight of 3 different flavored Aquavit. I liked the Pear, Vanilla and Black Pepper flavor because it was the cleanest-tasting. I didn like the Lychee flavored (too alcohol-tasting) or Mango Chili flavored (too cloudy, not clean or refreshing).', 'It is, hands down, one of the most beautiful spaces youl eat in. It literally in the middle of a building in Midtown (55th and Park Avenue South). The ceiling is some dozens of stories above our head. There a two-story black marble waterfall. The interior is a garden, with seats breaking up the green.Anyway -- the food. Aquavit bills itself as the United Statespreeminent Swedish restaurant. Hey -- I not one to argue. It was really damned good.We decided to go with the seasonal tasting menu. We started with oysters (I am struggling to not call them oyster shooters -- you slurp the damn thing up in one move). Very good. Moved to a green and goat cheese salad, then a mushroom soup, and then the herring plate ... a poor little dead herring on my plate. Fortunately, Mr. Herring tasted wonderful, so all was not lost.Had gravlax and mackerel to follow, then salmon (delicious) and tuna. Finally, the chef went feet dry and served us foie gras and Kobe beef ravoli. I not sure Kobe beef is a Swedish speciality -- but maaaan. It tasted good. We finished off with some dessert that I forgetting.Delicious. Beautiful. I hope I can come back here.', SO GOOD. worth every penny. and if you eat in the cafe instead of the main dining room (and don't order as many drinks as I normally do), that's not thaaat many pennies. pretty reasonable actually. the service is awesome. every waiter that I've had there has been insanely helpful/personable. the last time I went, my friends were rushing to catch a bus after dinner, and our waiter EVEN PRINTED OUT THEIR BUS TICKETS FOR THEM. not to mention that every time I've gone, they've given us a free round of aquavit (flavored vodka shots) at the end of our meal. I've tried a bunch of different things. they have scandinavian specialities like herring that are definitely worth a try on a second visit, but I think it's best to go for the known crowd pleasers on a first visit. honestly though, everything is good. some dishes are just really, really good. I like the salmon sampler to start, and as far as entrees go, my vote is with either the hanger steak or the chicken. chicken is just chicken, right? that's generally what I think too. but this is some of the best chicken that I've ever had. it has been prepared a little differently every time that I've had it (on the bone, sliced etc.) but it's always delicious. the desserts are great too. I like the arctic circle and the princess cake.and finally, a closing suggestion that should NOT be ignored: get the lychee martini. the best cocktail I've ever had and probably will ever have in my life., I went to Aquavit for restaurant week last night and ate in the cafe. I was happy they let me sit at the table even when the entire party of 5 had not yet arrived. so i like bread. and butter. a lot. i didn't like the bread there. but i liked the butter.appetizer choices were mixed green salad, herring, and chilled corn soup. my party ordered a mix of the green salad (nothing special but i enjoyed it) and the corn soup (very good). if you order the herring as a separate appetizer- i suggest getting the ceviche. entree choices: hot smoked salmon, sweedish meatballs, seared flank steak in a beer vinegarettehot smoked salmon was like eating really salty cooked salmon. not a fan.sweedish meatballs. meatballs were overcooked and a bit dry. the mashed potatoes and ligonberry go very well w/ the meatballs. it was like....eating ikea sweedish meatballs ($3.99 + tax) but probably with slightly better quality meat. nothing to hoot and holler about really. its just like ..... aquavit sweedish meatballs = ikea sweedish meatballs X price ^3 or something like that.seared flank steak- i enjoyed this but was still hungry so i ate my friends' meatballs and their steak as well. its not like i'm some huge guy w/ a huge appetite either. give me more beef aquavit.dessert: arctic circle and warm chocolate block of sh*ti was scared to try the arctic circle bc it was desribed as a goat cheese parfait w/ passion fruit and rasberry sorbet....but dude...its good.i made the mistake of ordering the warm chocolate block of sh*t. and there was some weird tasting ice cream on top (practically melted too)...like mint and eucalyptus flavored or something that threw me off. the warm chocolate block of sh*t was warm...yes...and dry. a square of betty crocker brownies out of the oven would taste 100 times better.oh yeah if you order soda its like $5, just FYI.overall, i'd rather go to the ikea cafeteria for my sweedish meal experience.|2
7|aster-san-francisco|Really solid food is an understatement. Had the Radish dish, Croquettes, Smoked Trout Sunchoke and Potato Nettle Dumplings. The dumplings I have a feeling will be one of those stand out dishes, albeit everything was good. Smoked trout was also fantastic. Don't skip on dessert. The Beet Cremeaux was complex and delish. Wine selection is thoroughly thought out. Service was A++ and what you'd expect from a DPG restaurant. They are going tipless so the tip is built into the price of the entrees. Communal table in the center. Get here early, make a reservation, check it out before the bars or after., Excellent food...Agree with Andrew's review that the potato dumplings were absolutely delicious. We had the vegetarian option and the lamb shoulder entrees, both of which were wonderful. Wandered in without reservations on the opening night, and got seats at the communal table. Lovely wine list. Cannot wait to return!Enjoyed that the tip was included..., i never made it to outerlands while chef cooper was there. it was just way too popular. though i do think i caught his cooking when he was at coi. the opening consulting menu at huxley was also awesome so i suspected this was going to go well. it was smart of them to open earlier in the week than on the weekend. we got a table with a decent view of the open kitchen. it's dimly lit with burlap walls, floral paintings and a cool light pattern on the roof. the kitchen is well lit and it stands out in the dark. chef daniel patterson, aster's godfather was also working service. after perusing both the wine and food menus we ended up with a bottle of rioja and the dishes as follows:sourdough house cultured buttercured radish kimchi furikake pigs head croquettes mandarin kosho, nasturtiumyoung kale pickled beet, carrot, dill, grain mustard cold smoked trout sunchoke, radish, preserved meyer delta asparagus ham hock, alliums, egg yolk potato-black pepper dumplings maitake, peas, charred scallioncharred broccoli fritters allepo yogurt, turnip, cashewblack cod chard leaves and pickled stems, miso levain, smoked cod brothpork loin fried potato, umeboshi, rhubarb, tat soi raberoasted lamb shoulder vadouvan, cabbage, wheatberriesstrawberry vanilla, cultured cream, chamomile beet cremeaux white chocolate, hazelnut frozen chocolate mandarin, cocoa nib, basilwait did we have everything? almost, just not the soup. and it was all delicious. i have to say that they really knocked it out of the park. i expected as much given the pedigree. of the team.. our servers took great care of us and kept us happy the whole time. the system they put in place with the included service charge like coi/haven/plum makes it easy to do restaurant math and everyone gets a cut like they should. cant wait to come back when the menu gets changed up., Never went to The Beauty And The Beast And The Hare And The Tortoise so don't have comparisons.M.Aster+ Lamb Shoulder $33+ Delta Asparagus $16+ Pigs Head Croquettes $6+ Server's Menu Knowledge+ Oneida Silverware+ Hanging Tinker Toys+ Forearm Tat Culture+ Wavvy Track LightingDis.Aster- Iced Coffee Not Allowed- Napkin Style- Serving Sizes Kinda- Squirmy ToddlerRounding up to 4 bc food flavors., San Francisco,I hate that I love you. As my birth city and a city that I adore for its diversity, awesome eats, and liberalness (hello, bare butt cheeks in the castro) but the gentrification is just getting out of hand. From $7 beer in a plastic pee pee cup, $15 sammies, to a $49 million condo (yes, it exists: bit.ly/1CsQQ1V). For pete's sake, my parking space at work has gone up $90 a month and when I step out of my car, there's a pool of used needles on the floor and a drunk hobo offering me a sip of his 40. Sorry, dude...not before 7 am but maybe at happy hour?When it comes to food, I know no boundaries...as long as it's good, I don't mind splurging. For date night, I picked Aster, the new restaurant that opened last week in the old Beast And The Hare space from the Daniel Patterson Group (Coi, Plum, Alta CA). The New American menu is small and focused with 3 small bites ($4-$6), 4 apps ($14-$17), 4 entrees ($27-$34), and 3 desserts ($12). Wines by the glass was about $12-$42. Prices included tip but not tax. Our waiter recommended that each person order one dish from each category but $200 for a regular date night was too spendy so we ordered 1 small bite, 1 app, and 1 dessert to share, and we each ordered our own entrd9e. Portions are tiny for the high prices but we didn't leave hungry. If you have large appetite, I would plan for a second dinner: 20 piece McD nuggets for $5. FTW!We started with the Pig Croquettes ($6) had an uber soft gelatinous center with a nice, crunchy crust: bit.ly/1CsQQ1V. Good amuse bouche-type starter. Everything we had after that was underwhelming. Nothing was remotely bad but when compared to all the other brand new restaurants we visited this year (BDK, Sous Beurre Kitchen, Dragon Beaux, Liholiho, Al's Place, Cockscomb, Californios, and The Progress) nothing stood out. The Cold Smoked Trout ($17) was ok but I wish there was more smoke essence: bit.ly/1DbLCJp. My Black Pepper-Potato Dumpling entrd9e ($27) was like a pan-fried gnocchi: bit.ly/1xWSjPd. Mr. NSS' Lamb Shoulder entrd9e ($33) was tender but minuscule and way overpriced: bit.ly/1CbUjys. It reminded me of a braised beef dish we had at their sister restaurant, Alta CA except this was $10 more and half the portion. =/For dessert, we shared the Strawberry w/ cultured cream ($12) which was light and refreshing but nothing earth shattering: bit.ly/1aCkJUt.I washed everything down with a glass of the Hobo Cab ($15) and the La Rioja Tempranillo ($15). The latter was wonderful and highly recommended. Service was polite but there were some kinks as to be expected with any new restaurant. Our waiter was very friendly but went MIA after we received our order that we had to request a knife from the manager (?), and ordered dessert from the hostess. Contemporary rustic space with track lighting. Good for small groups only but there is a large communal table (fits 12) which I believe are for walk-ins. Parking is horrible in the area but there's a parking lot 2.5 blocks away on 21st and Bartlett. I feel bad for just giving 3 stars but the prices were too high for underwhelming food. I forgot to mention, it was $5 for a 6 ounce glass of soda filled with 90% ice. AND, Mr. NSS, had the balls to order two!No wonder he said, it was my turn to pay..., Brand new restaurant that's definitely going to take off! Fantastic vibe, great service, outstanding food! Must must get dessert. We had the Bert and blood orange deliciousness, and I really don't have enough words to describe it! Potato dumplings were delicious, croquettes were great, smoked trout was perfect. Will definitely come back! Bonus points: this place takes Cover! Download the app!!, Very nice effort from a group with high expectations. Was initially a bit annoyed to be seated at the communal table with a reservation, but the seats are well-spaced and it doesn't feel cramped. The new decor is attractive, including the ceiling lighting.Everything we tried -- cold-smoked trout, asparagus with ham hocks, potato dumplings, lamb shoulder, and two desserts -- was well-prepared, nicely presented, and delicious. Seasonal vegetables were fresh and perfectly cooked. The service is still working out some kinks, but glad we got in here before it becomes impossibly packed -- as it certainly will. That will bring it up to 5 stars. Maybe a bit gratuitously expensive, as are many new San Francisco places (do they really need to charge for bread and butter?), but I really appreciate the service-included policy and hope it catches on. Overall, glad to have this in my neighborhood!, $30 dollar entrees in the Mission. There is just something so odd about that to anyone who has lived in SF for more than a decade. Aster is the kind of restuarant that would have been in another neighborhood a decade ago or even five years ago. While the decor and service were casual enough, the prices and food was far more Fidi or Marina.Tip is included in the price but surprisingly not tax and you would be hard pressed to leave here without spending at least 50 a person. Even with just one entree per person it would be 30 a person. The server recommended we EACH do one plate from each of the four courses which would have been around 100 a person which puts this out of the daily dinner rotation. The New American menu is small and focused with 3 small bites ($4-$6), 4 apps ($14-$17), 4 entrees ($27-$34), and 3 desserts ($12). Wines by the glass was about $12-$42. We did end up getting 2 small bites, 2 apps, 2 entrees and 1 dessert as well as a dish they accidentally prepared for us and we didn't pay for. We also had two bottle of sparkling water at 7 dollar a bottle. Total came to $140 including tax.It's still 4 stars because the food was good, really good. The flavours were all there in every dish. The bread that was present in so many dishes was just as good as I remembered it at Outerlands. The food was interesting without being flavourless or too precious. We started with1. bread ($4) which is considered a small bite which is just odd and a practice I despise. But it's delicious bread that we kept and used throughout our meal.2. Pig Croquettes $6 which are very soft with gelatinous pig cheeks inside a crisp shell. If you are expecting more a fritter texture avoid these. I enjoyed them and 4 is the right amount for this rich meat bonbon.3.The cold smoked trout ($17) was very light on the smoke and a rather small dish for the price. I couldn't help but compare it unfavourably to the smoked trout at Al's Place that was cheaper and better tasting. The dish was enjoyable with all the flavours you'd expect in a Scandinavian inspired dish.4. Green Garlic soup, olive oil crouton, pickled fennel, lemon ($14) as good as any we've eaten in the spring in the south of France this dish was a hit with the French Spouse who felt strongly it needed a poached egg on top.5. Black Pepper-Potato Dumpling entrd9e ($27) had a nice combination of flavours for me but I felt there wasn't the right portion of starch to vegetables. The French Spouse loved the dish and the gnocchi like tiny dumplings. 6.Black cod. chard leaves and pickled stems, miso levain, smoked cod broth (34) This was beautiful dish with amazing vibrant flavours, delicate fish and a broth I would have loved to drink by the cup. It was also a rather small piece of fish for $34.7.Strawberry vanilla, cultured cream, chamomile ($12) This was simply a deconstructed strawberry sponge cake. It tasted good but was in no way at the same level as the savory dishes and 12 for dessert needs to be something more than that.We also were given delta asparagus ham hock, alliums, egg yolk ($16) which we did not order and were not charged for. It was tasty but not memorable.I get a little sick of restaurants that spend more on the decor than they do on the food but I loved the decor here. No freaking wood on the walls and they actually soundproofed the entire ceiling. They had a very simple to make but highly creative lighting system on custom metal channels and with the use of mirrors and a black ceiling really expanded the space while keep the sound baffling. They used soft fabrics on the long banquets and burlap on the walls. The huge problem with the decor is having a door that doesn't close and clientele that are so clueless or entitled that they can't seem to close the door. Do not sit near the door or you will be cold from the door constantly being open. The reception person was oblivious to it with other servers and patrons having to close it as she just stood there. I am not sure how a wheelchair can access the space with narrow double door unless the second door is unlocked and the aisles are narrow. Walk-ins were seated at the huge communal table which is not wheelchair accessible. The tables are very close together and we got to hear all about how the table next to us was evicting people from the Mission building they just bought and how hard it is to find good contractors in the city. That kind of sums up the patrons here. With the influx of tech money in the Mission who also go out for every meal and the national level attention Brent Cooper already has this place will be popular. For a DPG restaurant this is far better than Alta CA but targeting the exact same demographic and it succeeds at that.I would love to come and try more of the menu but with delicious and cheaper places like Al's Place so close by, it will be a while before I return., 'I would have expected much better from Brett and Daniel. There is a reason that the service is included in the price of the food. The food was mediocre - and with so many other great places to eat in the Mish/Valencia corridor- these guys need to get their game on', 'When I go to a restaurant within a month of it opening, I expect a few flaws in execution and service. Acclimating to a new kitchen and new menu, and cooking with people you haven cooked with before is inherently challenging. So the experience I had at Aster just a week after it opened was all the more impressive. The two of us ordered:--Bread and butter (delicious)--Croquettes (Light but meaty, and just delicious -- though I thought the mandarin kosho was a bit too sweet and too much, so i scraped a bit of it off)--Kale salad (best in SF -- tender baby kale, perfectly dressed, and the crispy, flavorful carrots just set it off)--Ham Hock (flavors were on point but asparagus was a bit over)--Pork loin (perfectly cooked, incredibly tender, and interestingly paired with flavors and textures that all came together well. Nothing on the plate would wow you by itself, but everything came together really nicely)Then we had the strawberry dessert and it just sent everything over the top. Sorry for getting a bit wordy here, but I spend most of my money on food for two reasons: first, to experience new flavors and new sensations that only a great chef can really bring out. And second, to have old flavors Ie tasted countless times before elevated to a new level. This dessert was an example of the latter. There was nothing really special about the ingredients themselves (though the strawberry flavor in several components of the dish was damn good), but eating it brought me so much happiness, I was glad we were the last ones in the restaurant. I made noises. And it very rare that sweet trumps savory for me. Anyway, if this were a restaurant that were two years old, I would probably be right between four and five stars. But after so many underwhelming meals at new restaurants that turned out great just a few months down the road, I have to give Aster a five, and just express my excitement at where this team might go if they continue to improve upon what theye already doing.', 'The potato dumplings were by far the best thing we had. That would be the one must have in my humble opinion. The menu is rather limited and pricey. Many of the dishes we tried were just mediocre, and expensive... and yes, also small. Not sure why tip is included but not tax - if youe going that route why not to all the way and make it you pay what you see? Maybe because the prices are already inflated?Agree with the other review that I much preferred sous beurre over here - more comfortable space and ambiance and the price was way cheaper AND included tip and tax.The baby kale salad was ok. The croquettes also ok Lamb shoulder the other girls liked. We all loved the potato dumplings (also randomly cheapest main). The service was mediocre. We were left hanging in situations - after ordering the $5 bread -4 thin slices we didn have plates to eat them on and had to ask. The place wasn even busy! There were only a few people at the communal table and maybe 8 other people in the restaurant. Which also leads me to wonder WHY reservations were so limited on opentable yet the place wasn even half full when we went?!Overall am not eager to repeat - sous beurre much better choice overall! Mindblowing Brussel sprout and apple salad there.', Good food from a new establishment in the Mission.I visited early on a Sunday evening without a reservation as was seated right away at the communal table. The restaurant features dark wood furniture, artwork on the walls, and an open kitchen that looks over the restaurant.The food itself was pretty good, although I personally preferred the small plates over the large one I tasted.My favorite dish was the smoked trout: the lightly smoked fish, the radish, the sun chokes, and the preserved meyer complimented one another well and left me wanting more. The asparagus with ham hock and egg yolk was also a good mix of flavors. The pig head croquettes are worth trying; I don't think I'd want the croquettes by themselves but they pair really well with the mandarin kosho on top.I was a little disappointed by the lamb shoulder. While it was fine, I didn't think it was quite as interesting as the smaller plates.If you feel like dessert then I'd recommend tasting the beet cremeaux and white chocolate dish. (I didn't try the other two desserts on the menu.)Finally, be aware that service is included in the price of menu items. I personally like this approach., We ate here just a few weeks after they opened, which can always be a risky decision. Considering that they were so new, it was an excellent experience, and we look forward to visiting again.The service was great. Our server was knowledgeable and down to earth. She also didn't skip a beat when we didn't like the first glass of wine. She replaced it without a fuss and without making us feel bad. Big plus.We had a kale salad which was delicious and the potato and pepper dumplings, which were also delicious. The wine wasn't outstanding, but it was good enough.It was nearly fully booked while we were there and had a nice atmosphere and buzz, but it was still quiet enough that we could have conversation. We appreciated this.Gratuity is included. Entrees seemed reasonably priced despite this, at $29 - $34. The place where they get you is on things like sides ($8.00 for broccoli) and bread ($5.00), but it was a good experience and we will return, especially since it will probably be even better in the coming months once they fully get going. Definitely recommended., 'After reading an article in SFGate two days ago (insidescoopsf.sfgate.com43_) about restaurants instituting an all-inclusive menu pricing (that is, the menu price is increased to cover taxes, tips, SF Health surcharges, etc etc.), I wanted to support this initiative by spending my birthday dinner here. I am a big proponent of this idea and believe that diners should pay a fixed price for their dinner, like in Japan and France. To me, great service is expected and should be part of the job and the price should not fluctuate with each meal I have at the same restaurant. Keeping this brief....I was completely caught by surprise and disappointed to find out the restaurant had decided to revert on this decision to have all-inclusive menu pricing. (At almost $40 for my smallish beef entree, I really could not tell that it was not all-inclusive). I really wanted to like Aster, but all-inclusive menu aside, while the food was not bad (we tried 85% of the menu), and the service was attentive, there are so many other good restaurants in SF.', 'Great way to celebrate the last day of our honeymoon. Food was fantastic in every way.', * They no longer have the 'price includes gratuity' policy*This place rocks. I love every dish we tried - they were thoughtful, creative and awesomely executed.The ambience also was really great, I loved what they did with the space. It felt much bigger with some smart decor they did.I would not hesitate to recommend this place.This place truly deserves 5 stars on normal circumstances.. but I have to say a few things about the service we received.Upon walking into the place, I knew it was very crowded and understaffed. But a place with those price tags should've figured the service part out by now.Our waiter was a very nice guy - he was knowledgeable and friendly. But he forgot to refill our water, asked us which dessert we wanted without giving us the dessert menu, and.. forgot to inform us about the change in the gratuity policy which led us to going back to the restaurant and asking another waiter if it was okay, then only to be told our waiter forgot to mention it.I hope they figure this out soon cuz I think it's already a rock star place! But some people WILL turn away or never return for reasons like this.Thank you, Aster!, 'Great atmosphere, warm and inviting interior, attentive, yet unintrusive service. Definitely try the sourdough bread, a delicious homage to San Fancisco, I was wowed by the flavor. Pig head croquettes are a must have, and as a former vegetarian I am quite finicky about meat but they are brilliantly executed. New American cuisine is about local ingredients, the use of the whole animal, and getting away from industrialized agriculture. This concept is executed here with a touch of finesse and creativity, and I cannot wait to return for more. Both wines I tried were delightful and they had a fairly large by the glass selection.For the quality of the food and elegant ambiance I think the price is just right. Good luck to the owners and staff, I love seeing more quality places surfacing in SF.', The old Beast and the Hare spot that is opened by Daniel Patterson with previous Outerlands chef Brett Cooper! Been waiting for this place to open to try and we stumbled upon a reservation a couple weeks ago.Food- I can definitely taste the Outerlands' style in the food! Cod wing was interesting, prepared with spicy yuzu and plum vinegar. It was soft, light, and a bit tangy. Young kale was like a salad that came with delicious carrot chips. Green garlic soup was tasty, not very garlic and Aster split the portion into two bowls without me or my husband asking. Each portion was the size of one full portion! Potato dumplings were pretty delicious, a bit peppery, but that added some good heat, tasted like gnocchi, served maitake mushrooms, peas and charred scallions. I was so full already, but dessert did not disappoint! The frozen chocolate was yummy. Husband ordered the green elixir which tasted good.Decor/ambiance- good use of the space and sleek design/decor. Dimly lit so each table had additional candlelight. If you want brighter lighting, dine here earlier. We had 7:30pm reservations and they dimmed the restaurant even more during our meal.Service- staff are friendly and took our order accurately. However, our waiter came by and told us he will get us water when another staff member already poured us water. Another instance (I forget the details) suggested he didn't remember something. Overall, service was okay. I think a chef dined right next to us, so a chef always bought over his dishes with nice introductions. Overall- good experience with interesting food. I would come back to try other items and when they change up the menu. Portions are of decent size and service charge is already included in the prices, so your bill is only the prices on the menu plus tax. No need to calculate tip, which I thought was nice (unless service absolutely sucked)., Very sorry to say I fear this place will not survive. Delicious food but way too expensive. Service a bit slow and a little stiff. Hope they can get a vibe going and find ways to jazz things up a bit so they don't die as quickly as the Beast and the Hare did., They have done a great job designing and decorating the place. We found an early reservation on a Sunday. It wasn't and didn't become too crowded.The meal was wonderful and nicely spaced out. Definitely recommend the La Rioja Tempranillo !Beautiful wine.Cold smoked trout was the best I have tasted and I tasted many , it is one of my favorite dishes and here it was done to perfection. Young Kale salad was very,very good and I am usually not a great friend of kale. But here it was small and tender with beets,shaved carrots etc.Potato Dumplings were delicious with great flavour and the Black Cod was amazing ,wrapped in Kale and poached in smoked bone broth. There were some peas in shell there that could have been cooked a touch longer but still good.For dessert we shared the Beet and orange creme with white hazelnut chocolate,so good we almost ordered another one.Only complaint I have would be some prices. The Cod was $ 38 which is very high for the Mission.These are more Financial District prices, same goes for the dumplings at $ 28And if you consider that the tip is no longer included then it becomes a very pricey meal.Nonetheless a very good experience and I wish them the very best ., 'I didn love Beast and Hare, so I was excited to see Aster taking over its space. I like what theye done with the decor particularly along the ceiling, and it really lightens and opens up the place.They have a beer and wine license only with some glasses going into the $40 range, but they had a pretty good variety of wines by the glass from both Europe and America.As the 5 of us were resuming our dinner club, we went with one of everything on the menu (our usual), minus the trout and soup (as appealing as green garlic soup sounded, it hard to share).Bites: - Sourdough: fresh bread that light and and chewy inside, served with house cultured butter. I actually used the bread to soak up the remaining miso from the radish dish, which I thought was a better use for it- Miso marinated pickled radish: everyone at the table wanted to skip this one (except me!), and it ended up being well liked - it slightly pickled with a hint of miso richness- Chicharrones: not as light as I expected and slightly stale in texture. The seasoning on it is really nice, though, with the red espelette powder. What made the dish was the charred avocado dip, which was smooth and like a more refined version of guacamole (minus onions, tomato)Small plates: - Pig head croquettes: definitely eat these warm. As you would expect, theye quite tender and soft on the inside, crisped outside, but I don love head meat); the sliced kumquats help to cut some of the heaviness- Young lettuces: good dressing but a little too heavily dressed for me. The leaves were tender, but the highlights were the pickled beets and the shaved and crisped carrots on top- Delta asparagus: I can resist anything that has an egg on it, but it ended up being a dish sitting in a pool of egg yolk, which did the job for richness. The asparagus was ridiculously tender, and it still stood up well to the ham hock (I was scooping up every last bit of that). I could have used another of this dishLarger plates: - Potato black pepper dumplings: I had read about the nettle ones, but I know nettles are fleeting in their season. These dumplings were the favorite of the larger plates and possibly an overall favorite. They are nicely seared outside with a softer texture inside, but it still had bite. The accompaniments made the dish: roasted tender turnips, spring peas (not as sweet I would expect for this time of year?), maitake mushrooms (love these!). This is definitely a must-get and doesn feel like a vegetarian dish at all- Black cod: a close contender for the second favorite. The cod is super tender, but the highlight is this smoked bone broth underneath and the crouton that soaks up all the juice. The chard leaf it wrapped in makes it a little harder to cut, but the stems were really nice in the broth below. Definitely eat this one with a spoon and don miss this dish- Pork shoulder: a little richer and a little more standard in flavors, but the smooth new potato, rhubarb, and grilled broccoli were nice- Dry age beef: medium rare and sliced, so it easy to share. The beef texture was good, but flavor wasn amazing. What was amazing, though, was the green farro and pioppini mushroom porridge underneath that had amazingly rich flavors and good texture (I usually do NOT like farro)Desserts:- Poached rhubarb: we debated over this but were curious. The rhubarb was diced up, cooked down a little, and tart in flavor. It sat on a white creamier thing underneath (forgot what it was) and was unique, but not sure I would order it again- Beet and cara cara orange cremeux: not everyone loves beets, but I actually really like the subtle beet flavor and smooth texture. Some people thought the beet was a little too strong, but the cara caras really help balance it out- Frozen chocolate: probably the favorite dessert. The center is like a frozen rectangle of chocolate ice cream or semifreddo, but the mandarin oranges, cocoa nib, and mostly, the basil, really make the dish. I loved the basil with chocolate and have never thought to pair the two since you usually just see mint with chocolateFood came out at a reasonable pace, and they never rushed us even though we definitely took our time getting started. My main complaint is that I wish the sizes of the dishes were larger.When they first opened, the restaurant started out with 18% gratuity included in the prices, but they said it didn go over well with people, so now your check does NOT include gratuity. In the end, with 2 bottles of reds (we went for the less expensive ones) and after adding gratuity, it was around $90 a person.', Wine - Asked the waitress about European Whites, and she recommended a great Alsace Pinot Gris. Was exactly what we were looking for.Miso Cured Radish - Small starter, very interesting flavors, the sauce is excellent.Green Garlic Soup - One of the highlights, garlic wasn't overwhelming but was very present. Enjoyed the croutons for a different texture.Kale and Lettuce Salad - Complimentary from the kitchen because they said they were a bit backed up and our food was taking too long. We actually thought the timing was perfect and didn't notice any delay, but it was a nice touch to show they were on top of things!Dumplings - Amazing texture, and the mushrooms were fantastic. Great dish.Black Cod - Fish was very tender, and the chard was great. Overall was a fantastic experience. The service was fantastic, and the ambience of the restaurant is very pleasant. It is definitely on the pricier side, but I think it was worth it. Will definitely be back., Good dining experience. The space is relatively small so feels intimate and thanks to the design, warm and inviting.Food was innovative and not your usual crowd pleasers. We very much enjoyed the pigs head croquettes to start. The asparagus, ham hock, and egg yolk were well presented and had balanced flavors. The black cod was perfectly cooked and tastes great but light.I thought the potato dumplings were only okay. They were a tad too gooey for my taste but still a well presented and balanced dish with the accompanying greens.Service was friendly and attentive. I wouldn't mind coming back here again., I've been waiting for Chef Brett Cooper to get back on the scene as I've been a fan of his since Outerlands. Definitely worth the wait and his food is as stellar as ever. The food is refined and skillfully prepared with a subtle narration that is pleasing and undoubtedly delicious. Don't miss out on the dessert which we found to have a savory touch. The beet rhubarb dessert is outstanding., 'What a great new restaurant. Both the food and service have the refinement of a Michelin starred restaurant, yet in a casual and comfortable environment. The prices are reasonable and the food is fresh and local. I would highly recommend aster for a great night out!', This little restaurant did everything really nicely: service, decor and food were all good. I liked the fresh kale salad and the cod in the tasty broth. My husband liked the pig head croquettes. I appreciate that the chef's source and cook the finest local ingredients from small farms., The prices no longer include the tip, so they've effectively raised their already somewhat high prices another 20%. I like the food here, the first time my group tried everything on the menu and it was all solid. But I just came in for a late-night snack and paid $57 for coffee, a glass of wine, bread, and an appetizer-sized cucumber salad. With an entree it's over $100 per person, and for that price there are better options., 'My dining experience at Aster wasn great. I say experience because the food was good, tasty and refined, though on the small side. It was the actual experience of eating there that was lacking. To not go into too many details, here a list of downfalls with service on our slowish night with about 1/4 of the tables empty. Our server was unsure on how to explain a potato dumpling dish, offering enjoyable as a description (I suggested gnocchi and he agreed). We waited a good 3 minutes after getting our pork dish to flag someone down, who ended up being the host, to get knives so we could start eating. Our drinks were empty half way through the meal and stayed that way, on the table, until we left at the end of the meal. And, not once did anyone do a quality check to see how things were going for us. Because they are adopting a new tipping format where gratuity is included (which I totally down for), these problems that usually wouldn make me want to follow up with them did. This wasn just poor service. With service included in the price, it was horrible. I wrote directly to Aster letting them know what my experience was, not wanting to add a rating on yelp, but rather have them address it. All I asked for was a response. I submitted my words on their website template and I have never heard anything back from them. This tells me that the lack of communication, attention to detail and service from our waiter that was actually apart of their FOH model and how things are run here. I left hungry, dissatisfied and, to be honest, a little taken advantage of and with the last slap from their management, there are so many other restaurants I excited to dine at.', 'Aster falls flat.From former Outerlands chef Brett Cooper and the Daniel Patterson Group, Aster features NorCal-centric food with Japanese influences. The space previously occupied by Beast snd the Hare is so sparsely decorated that despite all the wood, it still feels cold. A long communal table fills the center of the room, while some booths and banquette seating line the walls. Seriously? For this price point diners expect a table of their own.From the start, the menu at Aster insults diners by asking $5 for four thin slices of sourdough bread and house cured butter. This smacks of the coperta that diners face in Italy. The chicharrones ($8) were heavier than expected, but saved by the red espelette seasoning and charred avocado dip. Wrapped in chard leaves and stems and drenched in smoked bone broth, the black cod ($34) was quite tender, but a little hard to cut. Despite the profusion of somewhat tasteless sun choke, radish, and preserved Meyer lemon, the cold-smoked trout ($17) was good, but lacking in smokiness.With only a beer and wine license, there is no full bar. As with everything else at Aster, the wine list is pricey with some glasses breaking the $40 (!!) barrier.Gratuitously expensive even for The City, Aster further escalates the bill with its service-included policy. And, perhaps because of this, service is medicore: polite, but cold; accurate, but not friendly; precise, but somewhat uncaring.With his excellent pedigree, Brett Cooper can do better. For the prices charged, he needs to up his game at Aster.', 'I had high hopes for Aster -- and unfortunately, I was fairly disappointed. Lackluster food and a bizarre service marred what coulde been a great experience.--Food--Certain dishes were inspired, other dishes were unfortunately just off. All dishes were stunningly presented -- but the flavors just didn match.Cucumber Salad: Very good, a little overpowered by the coriander flowers. Somewhat extremely priced at $15.Green Garlic Soup: Nice flavor, however, the pickled fennel was a bit overpowering, and I was expecting a bit more depth...especially given the garlic.Black Cod: This dish shone - it was beautifully balanced, and the broth was delicious.Lamb Loin: Lamb was excellently prepared and tender, if a bit gamier than it should have been at times. The spring porridge was just weird. Cloyingly sweet for a savor dish, with hints of an awkward sourness.Raspberry dessert: Good but not brilliant. The shiso was a nice touch--Service--The service was just....bizarre. Our waiter didn seem to understand how to interact with us. We noticed a chicharron dish that we had seen reviewed on Yelp on another table. The waiter said it was a special service for the chef friends, but mentioned he would ask the chef. The interaction took quite some time, with the chef clearly displeased that the waiter would have the audacity to ask. The waiter apologized that they were out of chicharrones.The pacing of the dishes was also terrible -- we waited 30-45 minutes between our starters and our mains....and the place wasn very busy.--Summary--It just seems like the place is trying a little too hard. Can they improve? Sure! I hope they do.', 'An absolute delight to the senses!Each dish was presented only after being crafted and displayed with creative excellence. The combinations used for each dish were new and outrageous. All was so different and taste tempting. I am eager to try it again, as soon as I can!', 'Wildly overpriced and small plates. Our party had to go get pizza after dinner at Aster.All four of us were quite disappointed. The service (blah), ambiance (pedestrian), and the food (although tasty, the portions were TINY). Probably the best soundtrack in the Mission though.One and done for our party of four, plenty of other options in our city.', This is a popular restaurant and booking is essential. It is not inexpensive and we were looking forward to something special. Sadly, it wasn't. The food is generally good, though not in my opinion worth the prices charged. The pork shoulder and lamb loin were fine, though quantities are on the mean side. The beet and rhubarb cremeux didn't work as a dessert. The only flavour that came through a complex list of ingredients was beetroot. The service was disappointing. One main arrived with an apology that the second wasn't ready. We had to send it back eventually to be kept warm. Not really acceptable for a restaurant aspiring to these prices., 'I think Ie been to every incarnation of this space over the last ten years, so I was excited to try Chef Patterson new offering.First, I love what theye done with the space. The mirrors & lights around the top of the walls make the cozy space feel larger than it is, and OMG SOUND BAFFLING?!?!? Yes. Yes please. Second, everything we had was fantastic. I enjoyed the cucumber salad (subtle flavors, but the flavor combinations of cucumber, Meyer lemon, salt, & cherry worked very nicely) & my bf loved the smoked salmon appetizer. Seared lamb was maybe just *slightly* chewy but otherwise perfectly cooked, & I loved the farro & mushroom porridge. My bf had the black cod in broth & it was also stunning. The wine list was not huge but included many tasty offerings, including a very good 2008 Tempranillo that was perfect with the lamb.I think the real trick with this place is the dissonance between the feel of the restaurant (cozy neighborhood dining) & the quality of the food (gorgeously plated & expertly crafted). They already had to yank the all-inclusive gratuity model because their costs are already so high (because of the quality of the food -- it was a $200+ dinner for the two of us after tax & tip), so it will be interesting to see whether the place survives. In the mean time, I would love to go back & see what else they do!', 'Aster is bombdotcom! The owner and executive chef, Brett Cooper, used to work for Outerlands in the sunset and he left there to open his very own restaurant which is just as good, or even better! I really enjoyed the layout of the restaurant and of course, the service was great. Great selection on the wine/beer list. I believe they do change the menu depending on the season. Items I ordered/recommend: - Rabbit Meatballs: morel, fava, pea greens, vadouvan - Black Cod: chard leaves and stems, smoked bone broth- Pork shoulder: sweet potato, rhubarb, grilled broccoli- King Salmon: peach, almond, chili oil, basilAs for dessert, I ordered the frozen chocolate with kumquat, cocoa nib and basil. YUM!!!', Aster was this month's restaurant of our Dinner Club -- probably my least favorite of the 8 places we've been to*As other reviewers have noted, the price doesn't match what you get -- and we went knowing it was a little pricey. But usually something makes up for that: out of this world food, amazing service, beautiful decor. Maybe it was our uptight server -- he didn't get us & we didn't get him. By the 4th bottle of wine, he finally got us ...The food was A-OK (hence three stars) but nothing really stood out and it certainly wasn't worth the price. It's New California cuisine -- but nothing was surprisingly harmonious or deliciously daring. It was a strange bunch of mish-mash, a few dots of this & that. The most flavorful dish we got was the green garlic soup. And yes, we finally ordered the $5 bread -- mostly to satiate our hunger, which wasn't going to be satisfied by the meager portions of food and tiny dots of flavor.Maybe it was because my best experience had been at the most recently attended Central Kitchen, where everything was flawless, so Aster greatly paled in comparison. Or maybe they haven't found their voice yet. Our hostess was really nice and the other servers seemed to do better with their tables. The one highlight is they let us linger for a long time and drink our wine....* (1601 Bar & Kitchen yelp.com/biz/1601-bar-an43_; Seven Hills yelp.com/biz/seven-hills43_; Kin Khao yelp.com/biz/kin-khao-sa43_; Beso yelp.com/biz/beso-bistro43_; Prubechu yelp.com/biz/prubechu-sa43_; Stones Throw yelp.com/biz/stones-thro43_; Central Kitchen yelp.com/biz/central-kit43_)., 'We were here for my birthday earlier this week upon recommendation of a friend. The flavors were delicious. We had a number of appetizers and dishes and my favorites were the potato black-pepper dumplings and the pork shoulder. The raspberry dessert was outstanding. The service was personable and attentive.', I really enjoyed Aster! (I wish I could do 3.5 stars...)I liked the layout and decor of the space, and the service was outstanding. Our server was really friendly and super sweet (side note on the guy who sort of bombarded us with a wine recommendation: 1. we had literally just opened the wine list when he came over, 2. he was sort of aggressive about recommending a very expensive bottle of wine...idk that sort of bugged me, but whatever, it's a personal thing I think). Our food was very good. We got the porchetta, which I would skip because it was just...fine, and the green garlic soup which I LOVED. It was beautiful - the color, the texture, the super intense flavor, I highly recommend the green garlic soup. For entrees we got the black cod and the spring lamb with farro. Both were very good, but I wouldn't call either of them great. The cod was the better of the two - the fish was wrapped in swiss chard, on top of a large crouton in a bowl of bone broth. While it was seriously delicious, and the fish perfectly cooked, it was sort of difficult to eat! The chard and crouton were neat impossible to cut through and so the whole thing was messy to eat. The spring lamb was also cooked extremely well -- perfect temperature really, but everything on the dish was very sweet - the way the lamb was seasoned, the farro, even the mushrooms...we both would've preferred them to tone down on the sweet and up the savory. We also got two deserts - both of which I recommend: the frozen chocolate and the cheese plate.Overall our meal was good, the service was even better, and I would likely go back. I will note that I feel like Aster is a bit expensive/overpriced for what it is., 'Some potential here, but not sure it is going to happen in this competitive market. Obviously a well planned and meticulous venue. Food is good (4/5) and interesting (we had black cod - ok, pork shoulder - ok, salmon app. and cucumber salad). There is a lot of focus on food and service technique for a neighborhood place. While there are a lot of employees for a restaurant this size, service was slow and inattentive (2/5). Hopefully over time the positioning clears up (formal or casual?) and the value equation improves.', I don't suspect this restaurant stays in business much longer - price doesn't match what you get, and charging for bread (it's the principal). Service was poor. Food was good, I might even say great (some dishes innovative) but the portion sizes were very small. And the fact that the cost was so high made us feel like the food wasn't as good as it probably was. 4 people for dinner was $350, and I'm definitely not full. They charge five dollars for bread. Who does that? Bread and the butter were exceptional. But it actually made the bread seem much worse given that they charge for it. If you're so proud of your damn bread and butter then give people as much as they want and then people will talk about it - instead of a guy like me who almost never (truly) writes reviews writing something!Chocolate for dessert, trout and pork were the only ones which stood out. Cheese plate for dessert was presented as a dessert not a cheese plate (server prob didn't know better, he explained it wrong) - yet what came was a TINY cheese plate (way too small). Two stars, food good but everything else brings this place way down., Every so often, we swing 'round Guerrero. When this wasn't The Beast and The Hare anymore (which was awesome btw), we had to learn what in the world replaced it and why.That happened to be Aster! I liked the architectural setup inside, where certain elevated mirrors made the room feel even larger than it actually was.On with our order! We shared the following:-Chicharrones-Pigs Head Croquettes -Delta Asparagus -Broccoli and Pork Belly-Cold Smoked Trout-Poached Rhubarb Pumpkin Seeds DessertI was really surprised how much I liked the Delta Asparagus, almost addicting. Broccoli and pork belly was amazing. Hats off to the chef of Pigs Head Croquettes, as its mix of flavors will tickle your taste buds until the cows come home!For dessert, I think we had a split opinion about it. I know I enjoyed trying something new, but we weren't sure if there were curry influences on that dish, not my partner's preference. By golly, I still liked it!It was an enjoyable early-evening dinner for sure. Great service. Hope to return!, I had real high hopes for Aster as I had read about it on eater. I got a reservation as the start of a holiday weekend to kick it off right.The decor inside is very nice, mirrors on the wall give the illusion of a high ceiling and the kitchen is open facing the restaurant. Initially all was well. To start I ordered the 'lady in red' cocktail, which was delivered in a small glass flask like bottle. It was incredibly strong, but more of a pre-mixed drink. It seems they don't actually have a bar, so they might just keep drinks pre-mixed in bottles and serve right out of them, i wasn't a fan.For appetizers I ordered the halibut and garlic soup. The halibut was sashimi style, with radishes and chili oil on top, that was great, however they also sprinkled peanuts on it which just didn't seam to belong. The garlic soup was delicious, but again it had raw daikon which I had to just chew away, it didn't seem to blend well with the dish. Also ordered the house made sourdough (which is quite the rip off that they charge just for bread). For the main course I got the poached salmon and hubby got the lamb. Both were small portions and decent tasting. The dessert was by far my favorite course, as the frozen chocolate was delicious with tiny marshmallows and mango puree drops. Usually a restaurant will earn back some stars if the food is subpar but the dessert is good, but I felt Aster was lacking in the service. The servers never actually talked to us, just dropped off the food and left. Our waiter seemed chatty with all the other tables but us, and never really explained the menu. The only thing he did manage to say was that they now accept tipping, so that's encouraged. So after we tipped on our way out not a single staff member said bye, or have a nice night, we just walked our selves out.So in total I was not impressed, the food was alright, but its definitely lacking in service., 'We were excited to visit Aster -- very close to the Marsh and we had tickets to see Black Virgins are not for Hipsters. It is a beautiful restaurant.Three of us had 2 glasses of wine and beer as well as these menu items:SOURDOUGH, HOUSE CULTURED BUTTER - 5 -- Delicious but pricey for slices of breadCUCUMBER, CHERRIES, PRESERVED MEYER LEMON, AVOCADO, CORIANDER -- 12 -- DeliciousYOUNG GARLIC SOUP, OLIVE OIL CROUTONS, PICKLED FENNEL, LEMON -- 11 - DeliciousSOFT-COOKED EGG, CRISPY POTATO, NORI, CAVIAR VINAIGRETTE -- 14 - Flavors muddyPOTATO-BLACK PEPPER DUMPLINGS, MAITAKE, PEAS, TURNIPS -- 23 - TastyMILK-FED LAMB, SMOKED EGGPLANT, POLE & SHELLING BEANS, NEPITELLA -- 26 - FattySUMMER MELON, YOGURT, SESAME, LEMON BALM -- 12 - DeliciousFROZEN CHOCOLATE, MANDARIN, COCOA NIB, BASIL -- 12 - We ate about 1/2 of this dish. We told the server that the infused oil tasted off -- instead of receiving the feedback, he argued with us and explained that we were wrong. I suggested that he ask the chef to taste the oil and see what he thought. We weren trying to send the dish back or get out of paying for it. At another restaurant, the chef might have come out to taste with us or the server might have gone back and told the chef. Neither of these things happened -- at that moment, the chef was not behind the stove, so could have come out and greeted us. At those prices, I think that customer service should be spot on and', Overpriced. That about says it all.The food was decent, hits and misses; but for what they are charging and their approach, you should expect Michelin star quality -which this clearly wasn't.We started with the Cucumber with cherries, meyer lemon, avocado, and coriander. It was OK. Interesting but nothing remarkable.The Young Garlic Soup was the standout, an incredible blend of pickled fennel and lemon. One of the best soups I've ever had. The Rabbit Meatballs with fava, carrot, and vanduvan were forgettable. Tasted like turkey meatballs. The Black Pepper Dumplings with mushrooms, peas, and turnips were decent but passable as well, nothing to justify the $20+ price.The Pork Shoulder with sweet potato, rhubarb, and broccoli was commendable but nothing worth returning for either.All in all, pretty disappointing. They will need to up their game quickly or I see this corner being occupied by a new resident next year,, 'Had some friends from out of town for the holiday weekend and this restaurant was on several Hot restaurant lists, so decided on Aster.Called to make a reservation a week in advance, got a table at a reasonable time. Good.Night of the dinner, we are seated right away. The server seems somewhat knowledgeable of the menu and wine list, but had to go an ask someone else on a few occasions, when we asked a harder one like...this glass of Riesling for $42, how much is the bottle...ten minutes later that bottle is $150. Okay, so we order a bottle of Pinot for the same price. Oh and there are only THREE cocktails on the menu, which is why we went with wine. So if you are a cocktails person, do not attempt to come here.The menu itself is pretty limited. It is designed for four courses. I don count the $5 bread and butter as a course. Each person is recommended to order one from each section. Pricing per plate per section per person runs about $20. Times four, you do the math.I ordered the halibut appetizer, garlic soup and potato dumplings as my main dish. Originally I wanted the trout, but then the server mumbled something about they only had three fish left and it might not be fresh....hmm not fresh seafood no thanks! I decided not to risk it and went vegetarian. The halibut was delicious. Presentation was very nice. When they bring out each course, someone comes by and tells you what in it, the sauce, etc. The soup was alright, not too garlicky as promised. The potatoes were not good. Oily and hard to chew. We ordered four different desserts to share, and boy, was that the worst! First, the menu does not describe the desserts correctly and second, they all came out too salty and sweet. Especially the frozen chocolate. Even though the staff, appetizer and wine were okay...everything else did not meet standards...so it is unlikely I will be coming back.', So here's the deal with Aster: If you want to impress a girl/boy, it's a great spot for date night.The food is presented beautifully, it's refined, and it's delish.But real talk- while I wasn't completely mind-blown, Aster is still interesting and satisfying enough.The menu is broken up into different sections, and they want you to order a dish from each section for the full experience. Our meal started with some bread and butter. The bread was pretty amazing, but they charge $5 for bread! WTF?Anyways, moving on:+ The cucumber salad is a great and refreshing way to start the meal. Plus, all these flavors worked SOO well together: cherries, preserved meyer lemon, avocado and coriander ($12)+ Red trout appetizer was SUPER fresh. It's topped off with peach, almonds, chili oil, and basil. It's a great change from most crudo or tartare's out there. Nice touch Aster! I would definitely recommend getting this as an appetizer.+ Pork Shoulder: Most of the time, pork belly is served because it's easier to cook and has a ton of flavor already. But Aster does a phenomenal job using pork shoulder in this dish. It's tender, yet flavorful, and not dry at all. Combine it with the sweet potato and broccoli, adds a nice touch to complete the dish.+ The dumplings were OK. Ummm, I didn't hate it, nor did it like it. Get it if you want to try another take on dumplings.+ The black cod was my FAV thing here. It's flaky, moist, outfitted with a coat of chard leaves that sits on a thin slice of miso levain, placed in a smoked bone broth, with a hit of lemon. If this dish is still on the menu- you HAVE TO, have to get it!To sum it all up:The ambiance is chill with good music and great service, which is perfect for date night. Every dish we tried was thoughtful, creative and awesomely executed. The prices aren't too ridiculous, but the portions aren't big, so you might find yourself ordering a lot of stuff.Overall, it's a more than decent place to check out. You won't be mindblown (or maybe you will), but you definitely won't be disappointed!For more pics and deets, visit: cyneats.com/aster, I had really high expectations for Aster, and when you first walk into the restaurant, you'll immediately notice the beautiful atmosphere. The lighting and mirrors really make this space inviting and impressive. And the presentation of dishes? Absolutely lovely. Probably the most beautifully plated food I've experienced. Sadly though, the flavors just didn't live up to the presentation nor my expectations. That being said, I do plan to return to give it another try in a few months to see if it's just kinks they need to work out or if it's just a miss., Don't do it.Overpriced, pretentious, annoying service. Our waiter wasn't attentive, was more preoccupied with serving his friend's table than asking how our meal was or getting us our check, and he made our dining experience worse. Place was empty and we couldn't get good service even then. I started with the cucumber/cherry salad. Good.I then had the garlic soup. Interesting, inventive, but a little too tart for my taste. Don't.The potato dumplings were ok, minus the turnip and mushroom action.Not worth the $120 my husband paid for our meal. Whattabust., 2 stars, not because the food was bad, but it wasn't at all memorable for the price. Between 2 of us, we had the bread - $5 for 4 pieces of bread with butter....Started with the Halibut and Duck Liver Mousse Both of these were OK, not a lot of Mousse underneath the pretty presentation but was mostly tasty. Halibut wasn't anything new.Next we had the soft cooked egg and rabbit meatballs.The soft cooked egg dish was nice, I'm curious what type of egg they found that was so small.The rabbit meatballs were a disappointment to me, they lacked any real flavor I thought. Last dishes were the pork shoulder and milk-fed lamb.I liked the lamb, and the fixings that came with it. The pork shoulder was nice too, but once again didn't stand out really.We had a glass of wine each, and the meal came to $180 after a 20% tip.Service was average for SF, cooks bringing out plates, promptly asking if we needed more wine. Slower to refill out water. Nice descriptions of the food as it was brought out.Nothing was bad or wrong with our food or service, but also nothing stood out as memorable.Other restaurants in SF stand out much more at this price point., Uncomfortably HOT room - Aster was lovely with interesting food and decor. The service was attentive. But the room was so hot it was difficult to enjoy the meal. 80 degrees isn't acceptable! It's a real shame because the food was delicious and inventive and that should have been our main focus. We asked several times for them to leave the door open until it cooled off and they would never leave it long enough to make any difference. I went outside mid-meal to try to cool down. I doubt I will return unless this is addressed with fans or some type of ventilation fix. I hope to return for the food!, 'Creative, high quality dishes. Nice variety, great service, beautiful yet cozy ambience. Thought the four course fixed price was reasonably priced. Highly recommend!', 'Overall, I was very pleased with my meal at Aster. As a new place, I feel it still got a little bit of work to do to get up to snuff, but the food was delicious and beautifully prepared. There were three of us and we each started with the young garlic soup. Maybe it was too young, but the flavors just weren terribly strong for us. We shared the soft-cooked egg dish which was very tasty, as were the rabbit meatballs. For entrees, we also shared everything. I think the milk-fed lamb with smoked eggplant was a standout, with strong flavors that elevated the dish. The black cod was perfectly soft and flaky and moist, and went well with its accompaniments. The gnocchi, however, was not terribly exciting.As for desserts, the raspberry dish was amazing. A variety of raspberry forms, with a flaky meringue-like buckwheat cracker, creamy mousse...just wow. The frozen chocolate was good, but nowhere near the wow factor of the raspberries.', Ambiance - 4.5Service - 3.5Food - 1.5Value - 2Overall - 2 starsGiven the price of the recommended 4 course tasting menu, I expected a lot more. We tried most all of the dishes and were disappointed with almost all of them. I won't be coming back., 'Had an excellent experience at Aster and would strongly recommend a 4 course dinner here.', 4.5 stars With several new(ish) restaurant openings, the intersection of 22nd & Guerrero has recently been transformed into a delicious dinner destination (didn't mean to alliterate.) Aster's sourdough & salted butter is so lush & so appropriately sour, balking at the $5 price will seem ridiculous after one bite. The aroma from his lamb dish was mouthwatering enough to get me to try the eggplant mash which was the base for the protein. I started with Cucumbers which uses blackberries & avocado as a condiment. Loved the abundance of preserved Meyer lemon tang. A verdant, beautiful starter, if not for these fronds which reminded me of succulents! I opted to have a smaller plate as my main -- potato-black pepper dumplings, maitake, turnips, & peas. The dumplings had great texture; velvety with a bit of give without being too firm. 5-star flavor. Including a homemade lemon-lime soda (albeit unspectacular), total was roughly $65 before tip., Sloooow service took 45 minutes per course. Overpriced even at $55 for a four course meal - which I know is dirt cheap for the city. But:Halibut:nice presentation, but blandDuck liver mousse: more like pudding with shredded lettuceSoft-poached egg: too saltyPotato dumpling: like gnocchi, as advertised, but pasty. Main course and dessert - it's been two hours and I'm still waiting., 'My wife and I were really looking forward to this new restaurant from Brett Cooper. We really liked what he did at Outerlands. It was unfortunately very underwhelming. Very pricey for very small portions ( $11 for 6 bites of cucumber salad) that were not all executed ( a soft egg that was more uncooked than soft) all that well.The bread, the cucumber and the cremaux were highlights. I could not tell what the porchetta wanted to be.The dining room looked thrown together. The music was not really conducive. The service was good. But the whole experience was just very discordant.. Is it casual? Is it high tone.If you are going to suggest to diners to order 4 courses give them a 4 course menu option. Offer ala carte also but commit to a style of service/experience.I hope Brett makes the place into something. His cooking at Outerlands had soul and intelligence. I would love to come back and find it here at Aster.', 'There have been lots of write-ups about Aster since it opened, and some of it has been lukewarm at best. When we were there, we couldn understand where the negative reviews came from: the food was inventive and delicious, the service was perfect, and the vibe was relaxed and neigborhood-y. We loved everything we ordered, especially the halibut starter and pork entree, and our server was so knowledgeable about all the food and wine, as well as friendly and genuinely proud of the restaurant and what it has to offer. I go back again for sure -- one of the best new finds in San Francisco!', 'Great meal, very creative. Many fun surprise details in each dish beyond what is shared on the menu. Reasonably priced for 4 courses at this calibre and we look forward to coming back.', Very good food. Not a big fan of the egg dish--just a hot mess. Others are delicious. Service needs some better training. In a 45-seat restaurant it shouldn't take 20 minutes to order. But friendly service, when it happens.|1
8|atelier-crenn-san-francisco|Chef Crenn sees her plates as a blank canvas, and if you and your palate are in sync with her inspiration du jour you'll be delighted.I went here with my wife on opening night last Friday. When we showed up around 7:20 the restaurant was surprisingly empty, but filled up over the course of the evening. The decor is what I'd call modern rustic, carefully engineered to appear carefree. It creates an ambiance at odds with the Marina crowd stumbling to and from the Matrix next door.Our server was friendly, informative and clearly excited about describing the inventive menu. With his guidance my wife and I chose the following dishes:- Potato: cooked in the soil from whence it came and arriving in tasty Hot Ham Water (as good as anything Lindsay Bluth ever made). A must.- Abalone: Fresh and paired nicely with a Pamplemousse sorbet, but a little bland in terms of flavor (to be fair, I was very jealous of my wife's cheesy and hammy potato).- Sweetbread: The presentation was basic, but the marrow was stupendous. Something you'll either love or hate.- Pigeon (but really squab): Baked with sea salt and served with liver it's another dish that will divide. I enjoyed the juiciness and texture while my wife disliked the rareness of the squab and the entirety of its liver (yay, more for me!).- Lamb Neck: While lamb is common in the city you rarely see a dish made from its neck, and that's a shame. The meat was very tender and flavorful with excellent sides to enhance the core entrd9e.- Cheese: The double cream was amazing, and the others were good but not extraordinary.- Dessert: The Coconut dessert was an amazingly smooth way to end the evening, while the Winter Porridge was creative but less enticing to me.Atelier Crenn has great potential, and I look forward to seeing and tasting what local yet exotic ingredients Chef Crenn will incorporate into her cuisine next., Atelier Crenn is the epitome of 5-star fine dining in San Francisco. My guest and I were truly impressed by our entire dining experience at Atelier from start to finish. Far from a typical restaurant, Atelier cleverly tantalized each of our senses throughout the course of the night. Supreme attention to detail was directed into each item to ensure every dimension of the food is mysterious, intriguing, and delightful.The food is all served in an artistic, nature inspired presentation which is almost as beautiful to look at as it is to taste. Meticulous attention is given to every aspect of the meal-- from the temperature & textures, to the subtle nuances in flavor which delighted the taste buds. Each of the flavors we sampled seemed to artfully compliment one another, and the ingredients were all exotic and provocative. So much care goes into each dish--- even a simple, single strand of green onion served with my lamb neck had been triple cooked to bring out the entirety of it's flavor. The service was 5-star as well. Our waiter seemed to know the menu as if he had created it himself, and was invaluable in our decision making. We felt pampered by the staff, and were very impressed to have the executive chef Dominique Crenn create an impromptu, special off-menu vegetarian entree for my guest which came out fantastic.I look forward to coming back to Atelier, and suggest it to anyone who is looking for an exceptional dining experience., 'After getting a preview of the menu the other night, it was determined that the tasting menu to be put to test, so I returned on opening night 1/21/2011. As noted by one of our group about the pricing structure, if youe into trying variety, for $20 more, you get many more looks at various course from the $75, three course menu. So the five hour meal went as follows:-Amuses - potato&rice crisps, oyster poached in urchin emulsion-Kir Breton - A play on the beverage which was a frozen sphere of cider, creme de cassis, and frozen snow of yogurt-Oyster and Ocean - Sea Urchin and Lemon Cloud-Maitake - Maitake mushrooms, Morel Gel, Mushrooom dashi-Monterey Bay Abalone - Onion dashi, pamplemousse Campari sorbet, coriander, basil, lard-Le Jardin diver - micro root vegetables, their purees, grains-White wine - white balsamic palate cleanser-Foie gras, beet rhubarb merengue, micro greens-The Sea - oyster, cuttlefish gnocchi, anchovy, sesame-Truffle and sous vide egg, Atelier garden herbs, orange-Lamb Neck, Grains, Yogurt, Wild Sorrel-Pigeon en croute de sel, Rose, Grains, Coffee--Cheese Cart - bleu duvergne, Garrotxa, Red Hawk and Carmody -Red quinoa grained supreme in a winter porridge with hazelnut pearls and oxalis-Coconut, Pineapple, Guava-Tea/CoffeeUnlike the test dinner, this was a true reflection of service with live customers. The service was very leisurely as they were trying to figure out the flow of the night. Five hours may have been a long time to some but we had a great time the whole night, and in my normal fashion, we closed the place down. Excellent debut and with all that pressure passed, I only see the refinement of perfection to come.', 'Great art is difficult to turn into a business. Especially poetry. Many poets are not recognized by their contemporaries, largely because they don match their creation with the taste and prevailing winds of the day. Emily Dickinson, for example, did not accomplish fame during her lifetime; it was only years after her death that her genius was truly recognized.As a poetic culinaria, Atelier Crenn risks falling into the very same trap. Knowing fully well that the restaurant has only been open a few days, I want to establish that my review is largely based on areas where the restaurant is flawed in concept, versus mere execution details. In this way I feel I can be constructive and not viciously attack those rough areas which will, in due time, become smooth.The menu is subdivided into three basic choices: three courses, five courses, and a full degustation option of about 11 courses total.We opted for the five course menu. This setup is problematic because one is led to believe that fewer courses means larger portions but less variety. In reality the chef, in pursuing her delicate art, opts for very small plates indeed. Some may say refined; others may, unfortunately, read dainty and pretentious.The amuse bouche is a lovely selection of varied shellfish, a slow cooked quail egg, a grapefruit foam (that collapsed immediately) and a small potato souflee. I quite like that it a real taste of the chef cuisine and not just a time filler.My first course was abalone which was a $10 supplement to the menu. It served with a delicate pamplemousse (grapefruit) sorbet. it also tiny verging on hilarious. Five small pieces of abalone. There a perfunctory but nicely made (if quickly cold) onion dashi. Even Coi abalone course, as part of a 13 course menu, is more substantial.The potato course is fairly pedestrian in my opinion. The cheese and ham broth is great but it nothing but comfort food in ludicrous miniature. Sweetbreads with bone marrow. What could be better? I don know, more? It offal for crying out loud. This is rustic cuisine; plating it otherwise doesn make it less rustic. The seasoning and execution are great, though.A main course of lamb neck is actually pretty substantial; in terms of quality, it has excellent flavor, but even so I found it a bit on the dry side and somewhat grisly. I suppose some might consider lamb neck a bit of a novelty, but Incanto has been doing it forever, as a wholesome, rustic, gut-sticking option. The flavor is excellent, the sauce and plating are great. But given the daintiness of everything else, it actually just a slab of meat.The Sea. Wow. Now the waiter explained that this has something to do with the chef childhood in Britain. Poor lady! Did you grow up very poor? Were you scrounging on the seashore for whatever rogue morsels you could find? My goodness.This is a first for me, where the main course is actually in comparable size and quantity to the amuse bouche.Are you kidding? There is a vast, vast difference between being minimalist and being minimal. To my mind the former is about stripping something to its core essence and bringing that to light most favorably; the latter is about being skimpy, reducing beyond necessity.The line was crossed. Minimal, yes; whatever artistic value does not save a plate of ten tiny bits of shellfish from veering off into utter pretense.Moving on, the cheese course is great but the concept is flawed. There a selection of five cheeses, and each person gets to choose one, which is delivered as a rather large slab.A cheese course is about variety, guys. We weren born to dutifully consume cheese. You offer a cheese course to give us a taste of something new and we know, being reasonably intelligent mice, looking at the cart, that you can cut any size you want. Give us half the size of two, not one big one, and offer it graciously for our comfort and pleasure.Now, dessert.One is a red quinoa cooked in hazelnut milk with chamomile ice cream. It fine and interesting.The other is this coconut thing that, by my estimation, is one of the very best desserts Ie had anywhere in the world. If art can devolve into utter pretense, as wee seen, it can also produce real and lasting greatness. And here it is.Seriously, if this Atelier thing doesn work out, please, consider just setting up a food cart in Dolores Park selling that coconut dessert. You could probably IPO in a few years with it. It truly remarkable.Other notes: no bread? Really? That a new one by me. Especially considering the long waits between courses which I chalk up to your newness.I torn on this place. The food is absolutely terrific but tiny. I hope it changes direction and improves. The world needs more great art.', 'Atelier Crenn is new, small but already serving inventive and very, very good cuisine. The space gave me the feel of a Japanese country house, perhaps an indication that there is some fusion of french, cal-american, and asian restraint. Whatever, Chef Crenn has a sure hand. I went with a five course meal, consisting of 3 savory courses, cheese and dessert. A preface to the proceedings was a six part amuse that livened the palate and announced that the meal would be special. A lovely salad with the chef signature dirt and a touch of what I would call molecular gastronomy was artwork. More importantly, it was artwork that tasted wonderful. I should comment that the molecular flourishes throughout the meal served the food rather than simply being foolish showoff.The sea was a complex melange of cuttlefish ground into the shape of mini raviolis, rock shrimp, freeze dried spices, seaweed and more. It was light, different, and quite lovely.Lamb neck was an ample serving of braised fatty meat that that had been rolled about itself to give the appearance of neck. It was a perfect balance of fat and savory. It came with leeks prepared three ways.The cheese course was unique as it was accompanied by a honeycomb that added a woody touch of sweetness to the course. Dessert. Coconut. A light melange that was not too sweet but had contrasts of texture and temperature. Wonderful. Atelier Crenn will soon be impossible to get into and is a sure bet for a Michelin star.', 'Let start things off giving credit where credit is due. The service at Atelier Crenn is better than any restaurant Ie visited. From the elegant greeting at the door to the attentive goodbye, the staff showed experience, tact, and intelligence. The decor is well done. The caged lights, ceiling textures, and each purposely placed painting come off as though to have a meaning within the overall purpose, design, and vision of the restaurant as a whole. The food and general theme of the restaurant have fallen off the deep end into a black hole of the most pretentious and often made-fun-of aspects of French culture, enough to literally make you laugh at the menu. The garden vegetable salad description is expanded upon in italics: and its soil. What? I didn have a clue what he Seawas, and its side note of an interpretation of aquatic Flavors made me have to ask the waiter No, I really would like you to go down the list and describe every item. I have no idea what these are. The menu was confusing from a usability standpoint. I was trying not to laugh when the waiter began one description with something like Really, another beautiful interpretation by the chef. A late autumnal walk with her father, with texture and notes of.... At this point the level of effort required to determine if I was ordering land, sea, or hot air made my group just want to fire and pray for glory.The food itself was good, but only in the sense that every dish is what you would consider an experiment in the art of cooking where although something might not taste fantastic you have to label it a success simply by the amount of knowledge and mental masturbation required to have come up with the idea in the first place. I not sure there was a single dish that made me feel Mmmm. That was delicious. I satisfied. Much of that remaining feeling of want was due to the sheer tininess of every dish. Youe left feeling more than the slightest bit cheated, especially for the price. It one thing for a restaurant to have a number of staples, accented by flagrant experiments that attempt to push the limits of culinary art. It also reasonably acceptable for a restaurant to push the other end of the spectrum, while maintaining a backup steak or other dish to balance the menu the smallest bit. It another thing when your entire menu looks alien where every item acts as an accent and not a main. The staff were great. The wine and espresso were fantastic. Pretentious, overpriced, and insubstantial.', I finally got to Atelier Crenn tonight, a couple weeks after it opened. It may sound strange to say that I felt Dominique Crenn was underrated, given her Michelin stars, Iron Chef appearances and Esquire Best Chef awards. But due to the Luce location, I felt she wasn't as recognized as she should be. This should change all that.My friend and I had the Prelude to a Winter Night ateliercrenn.com/menus/W43_. In fact, the website (which doesn't reproduce the menu clearly) and the font size of the menu were my only criticisms. We couldn't read the menu clearly enough to see the prices. That said, for this level food, the prices were reasonable. And the descriptions didn't matter much, as the words didn't do justice to the tastes and presentation. I can't comment on each course but they were spectacular. Perfectly realized in almost every instance. The Truffle and Egg, for me, was perfection. My friend said that she would be content eating the Foie Gras, and nothing but the Foie Gras, for the rest of her life. The Walk in the Forest salad was spectacular and I usually eat salad as obligation instead of thrill.A couple of these reviews complained about portion size. All I can say is, my friend and I were completely full, satisfied but not sick. And the tastes will remain with me for a long time. I think this is cooking at an adventurous, yet earthy and authentic and deeply personal level. The atmosphere is lovely -- we could hear each other despite a full room -- and I plan to have a private party in the back room the next time I am celebrating something., I have to agree with Matt W. and I couldn't have said it better.Great service, pretentious menu/food, tiniest portions I ever saw.Oh, I don't know how someone could dream this up ! I almost feel sorry for them...., I hope this review can do justice to the mind blowing experience we had at Atelier Crenn. Rarely in my life have I had the good fortune to experience what can only be described as a profoundly virtuosic performance. The cuisine is multi-faceted, working on so many levels that I find myself comparing it to the best concerts, operas, plays, dances, and art works that I've seen. This all may seem too much, but when an experience keeps you up at night thinking about, dissecting it's every morsel and when you do fall asleep it's what you dream about, the feeling must be authentic.After moving recently to San Francisco from Paris, I was extremely disappointed with what passed for haute cuisine. Atelier Crenn has renewed my faith in the Bay Area. What truly sets Atelier Crenn apart is how every element (texture, visual aesthetic, aroma) works together to build something greater than the whole. I've never encountered a cuisine that fully realizes the potential for smell and taste to unlock memories and transport you to another place. Most of the dishes we had actually did this and those that didn't were still absolutely divine. The micro vegetables with snow gives the feeling of walking through a snowy meadow, snow crunching underfoot with the brisk air bracing the skin. The interpretation of the sea communicates the lusciousness of salty-sweet air one encounters by the ocean in the morning. The coconut dessert is snow blowing over the landscaping forming snow drifts in a serenely delicate manner.If you go to Atelier Crenn, the tasting menu is a must and let the experience take you away. After the 9? courses, I felt energized and satisfied. I don't think the criticisms on portion size are justified. The dishes are clearly created the way they are for maximum impact. Larger sizes would alter the balance achieved and dull the experience. Also, there isn't one iota of pretentiousness here. It's as authentic an haute cuisine as I've ever encountered. It looks you in the eyes without blinking. It is confidence and creative genius on a plate., 'Cute place but I feel it is a bit overpriced for the quality of food. Staff is great!', 'There are few things worse than Yelp mouthbreathers who will lower the rating of a place just because of the price: as if theye too stupid to notice that there is a deliberate Price Range ranking independent of the star rating. (This isn brain surgery, kiddies.) Because it simply asinine to equate a four-star rating for a $100/plate top-end restaurant with one for a $4 burrito joint with a non-functioning toilet. Theye not even on the same planet.So yeah, it expensive. But that what those $$$$ signs are for. But compare this place with others of its ilk, and it measures up admirably. Most pricey SF restaurants try to excel by being more local and more organic than the next guy, and that routine gets old quickly when you compare it with the restaurant diversity of a New York, for example. So what great here is that the food is unique for the area. Chef Crenn does a great job exploring the human palate with simple, small bites that are of some of the best examples youe ever tasted of an item.The downside is that while the food has some soul, it not the most filling meal. Carbohydrates are hard to come by, as the menu is dominated by a dazzling array of proteins and fats.Also on the negative side, the service is still working the kinks out. We got to finish a decanter of some other table wine during an obvious mix-up. And there are still coordination issues between the staff -- such as not being able to time wine pairings properly with each course.And if you must harp on price, the wine list is insanely reasonable for a restaurant of this kind. But beware the Michael Mina touch of a pairing menu that often overloaded with Austrian Reislings and light on decent reds. Still, it a star of SF. And given how few peers it has at what it does, it gets a 5-star. Use the dollar sign ratings to weigh as you wish. And if you want to complain that you don leave here feeling like a bloated pig waiting for the slaughter, I sure the nearest all-you-can-eat Sizzler will gladly take your money.', 'A miserable dining experience. It took 30 minutes from the time we were seated until the time that a waiter actually graced our table with his presence. Overall, a four course dinner took four hours - literally. it was ridiculous. And the waiter seemed not at all concerned. After the dinner was finally over, the chef came out and personally apologized. Even she could not explain the delays or the fact that one of the courses come out cold when it was supposed to be hot. My impression was a kitchen in chaos and and front room staff that did not have a clue. So, foodies beware. A big reputation does not necessarily mean a great meal. My recommendation is that you take your dining dollars elsewhere.', I have many vices. I love shoes, handbags, travel, lip glosses, hoarding pets, and cursing, but everyone who knows me knows that my greatest loves are food, wine, and beer. Now I can add Dominique Crenn to my list of loves. She and her sommelier are gods.Boyfriend and I went to Atelier Crenn for our Valentine's Day dinner even though there wasn't a special Vday menu, which is our usual M-O. No matter. It was one of the most amazing meals we've ever had, and we should know. We almost ate the entire menu. We did the largest chef's tasting menu with wine pairing, and not one course disappointed. We've dined on Hubert Keller, Joel Robuchon, Rick Bayless, Michael Mina, Masa's, Wylie Dufresne, and we know how amazing it is that this chef did not miss a beat. She pitched a perfect game.In fact, since it was all great, I'll just tell you about the highlights. Otherwise, you'd have to relive my 3-hour meal:1. Amuse bouche -- 5 individual amuses. Start with the oyster and seaweed, which is beyond simplicity and incomprehensibly delicious. End with the speck, which is a heady teaser for the rest of the meal.2. Mushrooms -- Earthy and melts in your mouth.3. Foie gras -- My only regret about this course was that boyfriend sent the waiter away when we could've gotten a 2nd portion. OMG, it was sooo good. Salivating now thinking about it. Now I know that some people don't like organ meat, but for those people I say, sucks to be you and more organ meat for me.4. Walk through the garden -- Now you're going to have to trust me on this, but this all-veggie course was actually REALLY good. I don't normally say this, just like I don't normally let people finish telling me about their favorite vegetarian restaurant or the best vegetarian meal they've ever had. I have better things to do than to listen to sci-fi, but for a meatarian, this was a quick trip into a vegetable garden that I didn't hate. In fact, I was a happy forager.5. Taste of the sea -- My love of pork belly has really taken a beating these last few years, what with every chef thinking that they can do right by pork belly. That said, I think pork belly has just gotten the beat down by a tiny morsel of heavenly rock shrimp. I tried to convince boyfriend that it sucked and that he shouldn't eat it, but apparently, his love for me doesn't involve believing lies about shellfish. I could have eaten the entire ocean of this course.6. Originally our chef's tasting menu did not include the sweetbreads, but I live by a firm belief that you never know unless you ask. So I HAD to ask. Could we add the sweetbreads with marrow to our menu...you know bc we hadn't had enough fat and salt yet? Not surprisingly, the chef was gracious and allowed us to do so, and low and behold it was awesome. Not sure if we could have also asked for lipitor, but I didn't want to press my luck.7. The only difference in mine and boyfriend's menu came at the meat course. He isn't a fan of lamb, and I am a fan of trying EVERYTHING. So he had the pigeon, and I got the lamb. Both of the dishes were great, but the pigeon was outstanding. I know that a lot of Americans hate pigeons, not knowing anything about the birds or ever having tried it, but I can assure you that pigeon can be an absolute delicacy if done right. Dominique Crenn's interpretation of the pigeon was even better than the smoked pigeon that we had in Barcelona. Make sure to try it and give a little respect for those valiant birds!! Some of them have been designated war heroes.8. The wine and beer pairings -- Simply put, the sommelier kicks ass. You wouldn't know it by looking at him bc he looks like a cool dude that you'd meet at the local bar or following Green Day, but what he does he does with the precision and accuracy of a scientist. I could totally hang with this guy all the time, though I'd probably end up an alcoholic bc I wouldn't be able to say no to anything that he offered. His wine pairings rivaled what we've had at Masa's.The service was also amazingly gracious. The only hiccup was in the succession of the courses of the foods themselves. This new restaurant and its staff are still working out come kinks: We almost got the foie gras twice, and we never got the abalone. We also never really got a chance to order the dessert. A dessert just showed up. Boyfriend hates coconut so it was really lucky that the coconut dessert was actually really good. I was happy, albeit a little confused.Then the icing on the cake, Chef Dominique Crenn came out to say hello, even though she and her staff were obviously busy as it had been a very busy Saturday night service. We were so honored that she took the time to come out to say hello and that we were able to thank her personally for what was one of the best meals we've ever had. The only question left for me is when will Chef Crenn change up her menu so that I can come back and eat EVERYTHING again?, 'Went there with my husband to celebrate v-day early, the place feels a bit bare and cold, I definitely would not go there for the atmosphere. When we arrived, noone was there to greet us and there was a line of 6 people waiting for the hostess. Finally she arrived and eventually ushered us to the garden room which is usually reserved for private parties but was used as an extra room the night we were there. The room is OK, didn love the fake plants and the lighting isn great. Again the decor is very sparse, not very inviting but on to the food... We got the tasting menu with its 10 courses (w/cheese course) and ordered a bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape. Of the 10 courses, a few really stood out for us, Crenn take on kir Breton was a nice and fun start to the meal, her Maitake (mushroom) appetizer and Jardin diver were delicious. Our absolutely favorite part was her fresh foie gras, she brines it, then cooks it sous-vide, freezes it and then pan-fries it so it crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, it is then topped with mini meringues! Absolutely perfect! What worked less well was her fish gnocci dish and her lamb neck which definitely need more work. The cheese course and dessert were exquisite. So overall, there were some amazing dishes and some pretty disappointing ones but the most disappointing thing was service, each course took a VERY long time to arrive (we were there for 4 hours!), the waiters seemed confused and disorganized, we were given sparkling water twice even though we asked for still all along, we got other people dishes and were offered the same thing twice (it was for someone else). But, I think that after working-out the kinks, this place could be great, we certainly had a good time and loved talking to Chef Crenn at the end of our meal. She is very artistic and imaginative. It was a pleasure to meet her.', 'My FI and I decided to try Chef Crenn latest creation for our Valentine Day dinner this weekend. After reading other Yelpers4/5-star reviews posted around the same time, I began to wonder if they went to a different Atelier Crenn. What we experienced at Atelier Crenn was a disappointment. The portions were tiny and we had the longest 4 hours dinner with the most inattentive service ever experienced at any fine restaurant. There was so much waiting around and thumb twirling throughout our evening. Although we were promptly seated, we waited a good 15 minutes before we were greeted by a server and offered water/drinks. There was at least 20 minutes wait between water and wine service, and waited another 15 minutes before our orders were taken. We opted for the 3-course meal but should have selected the tasting menu if we only knew about their portions. We waited another 30 minutes or so for our amuse bouche. I immediately noticed we had no utensils but unable to catch our server because he disappeared as soon as he placed the plate on our table. The oyster with nori was the most memorable piece from the amuse bouche. Again, we waited for some time before getting my FI probably one bite size abalone and my appetizer selection, The Sea, which was according to the server, Chef Crenn interpretation of the aquatic flavors from the sea while she lived in Europe as a child... with nothing more than several small sea morsels: mussels, clams, and fish/squid balls. About another 40 minutes into our ordeal, we received our entrees with the server finally decided to make an appearance to apologize for the extremely long wait. During this waiting period, our empty wine glasses went unnoticed and my FI had to find another server to order a bottle of wine. The server also neglected to fill our wine glasses until he was asked since our wine bottle was placed on the center island along with other dinerswine bottles. When our entrees finally arrived, we thought the server made a mistake as the entrees (pigeon and arctic char) appeared the same size as the appetizers... a few bites worth of food!The chocolate and pistachio dessert was innovatively prepared with molecular gastronomy technique. However, I found it tasted somewhat bland and not as exciting as its preparation.Even though Chef Crenn dishes were artistically presented and the food tasted very good for the most part, I just cannot justify the slow and inattentive service and insubstantial portions. I think Atelier Crenn still has a long way to go...', 'After calling a few weeks ahead to arrange for a Valentine day reservation, I was informed that they lost my reservation and couldn possibly seat us because they were so overbooked. Ie dealt with a lot of pompous asses before at nice restaurants, and am usually fine with that, but that was too much. Getting a reservation was painful enough but dealing with their prissy, non-apologetic attitudes after screwing up was just fabulous.I guess I wasn the only person who didn show up that night because their overbooked evening appeared to open up very quickly ... I got a call around 7pm telling me I could come in any time. Of course, I said no.Competition in the restaurant business is hyper-intense, so I suggest these guys act like they give a crap about their customers. There are just way too many great (and friendly) places to go.', Pros:Excellent tasting menu. The mushrooms are superb and very unique dishes. Cons:Price is to be expected, but service can be a bit slow. Don't do the tasting menu unless you have a good 3 hours to devote comfortably to the meal. Also they won't let just one person do the tasting menu. Fun:The chef comes out to your table and hangs out with you a bit during the meal. Also this was the old Plumpjack restaurant owned by SF's former mayor, and now the space is completely redone., 'The review from A S. says it all, had the same experience w/ the chef tasting menu (and wine pairings). The food itself is nothing short of amazing, and Chef Crenn deserves recognition for such creative poetic dishes. That said, the service lacked certainty, attention, and detail, not to mention promptness - unacceptable at this price. What should have taken 2 or maybe 3 hours took over 4, drawn out by unnecessarily long intermissions between courses with missed queues by the staff. The decor is stark, the lighting is harsh, and while the stained concrete floors look beautiful, they reflect noise - consequently the atmosphere is louder than it should be. My biggest gripe was that I left hungry... each plate of the tasting menu was the size of an amuse-bouche - fine early on in the line-up, but insulting for the main. Consequently, I had to eat dinner when I returned home. As far as food as theatre, they succeed. However, the negatives outweigh the positive, and Crenn has failed to create a experience that I would recommend.', 'Delicious.... Poetic..... Sexy...... Intimate..... Tasty.......', 'Stepping into Atelier Crenn felt like falling into C.S. Lewis Narnia. Master Crenn leads guests down enchanted wooded paths of sense and savor, reconnecting us to our origins in earth and time. The food serves as catalyst, like the grain of sand in the oyster, for the pearl of connection to one another and our food system. It is easy to get caught up in the hype of a world class chef, who has won Iron Chef and whose visage adorns the pages of the glamor magazines, yet Crenn takes us away from all of that as well. From the moment crossing the threshold into her modest Atelier or studio, the energy of the team is that of a family of highly focused and committed professionals intent on serving up the magic with genuine kindness. The experience takes you from one enchanted garden to next with great care given to the transitions. The palate cleanser before the main course was as far as I could tell a tiny cloud offering a mere whisper of flavor to reset the taste budsexpectations before something new to come. I cannot recall the last time I experienced new flavors or sensations. This is what is remarkable about the Crenn Experience--part theater, part culinary genius, much magic and mastery all packaged with the utmost of care and warmth, feeding stomach and soul.', If you imagine the bucket of chicken or endless breadstick experience - one single flavor (mostly salt) that you eat eat eat until stuffed and miserable and closer to death... Atelier Crenn delivers the OPPOSITE experience. Crenn's food piques all the senses. It is mindful eating (forgive the California-ism), with the focus on the purity and intensity of flavor in every foraged mushroom, dollop of sturgeon pearl, cloud of lemon foam, and perfect shred of tender lamb. And it is beyond-delicious.Yes, the food is uncommonly beautiful - plated with stone and wood and like an oil painting - but this is not laboratory-style gastronomy. It honors the earth it came from. And nothing is sacrificed for the artistry - flavor rules to an extent that seems almost magical.Certainly this is unique eating, especially for Americans. It is about savoring, not devouring and being fulfilled rather than just full. But I'm convinced this approach to food - pure quality over quantity - is better not only for the planet and the body, but also for the soul., My husband and I decided to try Chef Crenn's new restaurant for our Valentine's dinner. I was really excited since I have followed Chef Crenn's progress after Iron Chef and since she left Luce. Here is the breakdown as we saw it:Pros: All of the food was absolutely delicious. Actually, if I was to give a star rating on just the food, it would be 5 ++++ stars. Seriously this is probably some of the most amazing food I have ever eaten. And the desserts blew our socks off. My husband does not like pistachios and he scarfed the pistachio chocolate dessert down like there was no tomorrow and looked at me like I was a deranged alien when I tried to get a taste.Cons: Prices are definitely on the high side, however we knew this coming in. What I did not prepare for was the really small amounts served. We chose the three course tasting menu, and for the price we paid, I should not have had to consider buying some pizza from down the street to satisfy my hunger. Service also was a bit slow, but thankfully we were not in a rush. My husband was hungry though and it didn't help that he wasn't getting any fuller in between each course.Overall: This place is great for a special evening out. If I had the money, and ate a good meal beforeheand, I would come a lot more frequently. The atmosphere is really warm and inviting, and Chef Crenn spends some time with each table of diners throughout the night which I thought was an exceptionally nice touch., 'Like Masa? Like Coi? Like The Dining Room at The Ritz?....you are going to like this place. Definitely a feast for the palate & the eyes!!Not sure why other reviewers are saying the service is slow, this is fine dining not a restaurant. It is meant to be an experience, where you enjoy your friend company (may be those pesky reviewers that complain about the wait were arguing with your friends or didn you have anything to say to them?...LOL), while being served nice wines and great food presented in a great way. The amuse bouche were tasty, the foie gras was good, my wife had the Artic Char - the sauce was the only disappointment. I had the pigeon en croute de sel - delicious!Overall, if you are looking for fine dining, with impeccable service and presentation - yet not as formal as Masa or The Dining Room - you are in for a treat. If you are expecting, a restaurant, have nothing to say to your friends/family, don like to enjoy your food or wine, and have the jitters - pass - go to your restaurant....:-)Chef Crenn short visit was smart, always makes you feel special - a simple trick that does have a simple impact.', The minimalistic, organic, modern decor - the complex flavors of Chef Crenn's masterful art - are cleverly juxtaposed in this unique French restaurant. Come to experience a modern take on traditional French cuisine. My only complaint - no yummy french bread to indulge in. The cheese course is served with light crackers, and this simply does not cut it. Give the people some bread!Chef Crenn is approachable and personable. She takes time to walk the floor and talk to her guests as the evening winds down. All in all, a truly delightful sophisticated dining experience., One word: Amazing. It's been a long time since I've had a true experience in every sense of the word. The chef is like a good friend at dinner. The pastry chef has designed a savory-inspired treat that is a rare find in the city. Again, amazing!, 'Dominique Crenn takes you on a journey through her culinary life. I went here when the restaurant was very new. The service was very friendly but could have used some work on efficiency and timeliness of dishes. Even so, the food was delicious, beautiful and unique. I have not been back yet since, but I do not doubt that it has flowered into a beautiful mainstay of San Francisco dining.Try the full tasting menu, well worth the price.', 'Creative + great food = fabulous. Unfortunately Atelier Creen missed the great food part. We love minimalist and appreciate small portions but what we received was unfortunately not very good. I can think of only one upscale restaurant experience that was worse than this over our 11 years of living here. I think others are realizing it as it was Saturday night and the place was half-full. Tant pis.There were some very good aspects - the decor, the wait staff, the wine, etc. As an alternative restaurant in the same direction, we did enjoy Coi.', 'Here a review from the point of view of a vegetarian, in case you are one or have one in your party. First of all, you will only be able to eat at Atelier Crenn if you are a lacto-ovo vegetarian (which I am). I was really primed to like this place: I a francophile, I love the idea of poetic culinaria, I liked the graphic design, I liked the nest-like ceiling lamps. Our evening started somewhat stressfully because there was no one at the valet parking stand and it a nightmare to park in this neighborhood on a Saturday night. As a result, we finally stumbled into the restaurant 15 minutes late, but the restaurant was half-full, so it wasn a problem.As a vegetarian, there are exactly three courses you will be able to eat, and you must have a minimum of three courses, so you will have no choices. The first course is called Le Jardin diver, which is an assortment of about ten baby root vegetables with a yogurt sauce of sorts. It was perfectly fine, maybe 50 calories in total. The second course is a slow-cooked egg, which actually means an almost raw egg. Most vegetarians are a bit queasy about animal products, and I found this one impossible to eat. I okay with runny yolks, but not runny whites, especially if you don have bread or something to sop it up (no bread here at all!). I had to leave it, but ate the two small chanterelles and the couple of small nettle leaves used as a garnish, maybe ten calories in total. We were given a free palate cleanser at this point, a rather sour berry sorbet that was overly frozen using dry ice or some other gastronomic technique that freezes your tastebuds.The final course is called Walk in the Forest, with the rather romantic notion of foraged mushrooms. It was okay, maybe 20 assorted small mushrooms in total with a few herbs and a tablespoon of strangely dry sauce, about 100 calories. So after the three courses, I considered the cheese course but glanced over at the table next to us who were having it: razor thin flatbreads and dry-looking cheese. We decided to bail and have a leftover baguette and Brillat Savarin at home instead.We had a nice red wine for a reasonable price from the Corbiere region of France, an area we know well from holidays. It was the best part of the dinner.So if you are a vegetarian, you need to know that you will be spending over a hundred dollar for about 200 calories of so-so nourishment (few carbs or fiber). Unless you are on an Atkins style diet, you will do well to eat before going to Atelier Crenn with friends.', the sea urchin dish is to die forthe pine meringue was too sweet for methe mushroom dessert was really badthe arctic char was perfectly cookedthe portions are very small. and i don't even eat that much!, 'Stunning presentation and great flavors but tiny portions.Thanks to previous Yelp reviews, I knew going in that the portions were small so we knew to go with the tasting menu. Here are some of my impressions of the various courses (no notes, just going from memory):Potato chips with miso & dried kale: Serviceable start to the tasting menu. Good but nothing special.Foie gras, pate on toast, freeze-dried pea soup: This was more like it. Both the foie gras and pate were scrumptious. The pea soup was more of a novelty but interesting nonetheless.Oyster & Sea Urchin: Delicious combination of brininess.Kir Breton: Delightful sphere of cider that explodes in your mouth. Le Jardin diver: Parsnip puree along with assorted baby vegetables and rye dirt. Simple looking but complex flavors.Foie Gras with Truffle: Wonderful dish. Heavenly smooth foie gras with the earthiness of the truffle.Walk in the Forest: Various mushrooms on top of toasted pine meringue. A bit on the tart side due to the pickled mushrooms.Trou Normand: Meyer lemon ice. Flavorful but a bit hard to eat since it was too frozen.Egg yolk with rye, celery, and truffle: Probably my least favorite dish as it was all texture and not much flavor even with the celery and truffle.Pigeon: Tasty but a very small portion. Perhaps four bites. Maybe duck would be a better substitute?Cheese: A small wedge of cheese from their cart. Five different choices. Had the sheep milk and it was good but pricey at a $10 upcharge.Epilogue: Pine branch lollipop and a forest mushroom scene composed of ice cream caps, cookie stems, dirt, hay, and leaves. All the elements worked together to make it an inventive, playful and delectable dessert.Midnardise: Lychee candy, salted caramel, chocolate truffle, and thin pane of 85% dark chocolate. The chocolates were good but nothing compelling but the salted caramel was some of the best caramel that Ie ever had. The lychee was intense and a good departure from the norm.Service was excellent. The entire tasting menu took four hours to complete so be sure to set aside enough time!To summarize, it was a wonderful experience and I would definitely go back. Close to a full five stars but not every dish worked for me and not with such small portions. I would have rated it 4-1/2 stars if Yelp allowed for 1/2 stars.', 'I think I have a new favorite restaurant in San Francisco.Many people may remember Dominque Crenn from ron Chef America, where she beat Iron Chef Michael Symon; was on Season Two of The Next Iron Chef (Michael Symon was the winner on Season One); and has earned Michelin 1 Star ratings for her food at Luce Restaurant at the Inter-Continental Hotel in San Francisco two years in a row. Now she has opened up her own restaurant, Atelier Crenn, in the space on Fillmore formerly held by Plumpjack.Lynn and I had 8:00 reservations (Saturday, 3/26/2011), and were promptly seated. Plumpjack never had space to wait for your table, and neither does Atellier Crenn, but they have redone the room to make it casually elegant, warm and inviting -- the decor may be considered spartan by some, but I felt immediately comfortable and at home.Now I should point out that my wife Lynn has been going out to dinner with the same group of women since law school 30 years ago. She had already been to Atelier Crenn, and before leaving that night, she made reservations to take me here. The menu changes seasonally, and some of the dishes had indeed changed since Lynn was there ... nonetheless, I got a fair dose of What did I tell you? and Isn that fantastic? I *knew* you like it! She was right.Chef Crenn calls her food Poetic Culinaria, and the meal was indeed poetic. I be hard pressed to come up with a better word to describe her cuisine. I mean, excellent certainly fits, but it not nearly as evocative of her food as poetic.We opted for the tasting menu, but without the wine pairing. The current tasting menu is entitled Prelude to Spring Night, and is a perfect name for the meal to come. (Please be aware that I took no notes wile we dined, and am writing this from memory 24 hours later. If some of the dishes are not described exactly right, the fault is mine.)The amuse bouche arrived - foie gras with apple, a goat cheese with celery root, and a crostini with chicken liver pd2td9. Now, I have to quickly add that these descriptions do not even come remotely close to actually describing these delicious spoonfuls of delight. Atelier Crenn uses no plates - not in the traditional sense of the word. Slate slabs of various shapes and sizes, burls made from olive wood, glass bowls, and bonsai trees.We began with a Kir Breton. Now Kir is a popular Parisian drink made (traditionally) from Creme de Casis and Bourgogne Aligotd9; Kir Royal substitutes the white wine for sparkling wine. Normally, Kir Breton substitutes hard apple cider. So, nadfvely, I was expecting a small cocktail as a starter. But no -- here came my first surprise of the evening! Placed in front of us is a perfect sphere the size of the perfect chocolate truffle. Made of cocoa butter and chocolate, topped with a dollop of black currant jam. I popped the ball in my mouth and pressed upward with my tongue. The sphere burst and its liquid center of a true Kir Breton flooded my taste buds and senses ... rarely does one bite strike such pure perfection, but this may be the most memorable single bite of my life.Next appeared a beautiful prawn atop a smooth rock, and an oyster shell containing two oysters within ... OK, I hate to be repetitive, but rarely has a prawn attained such perfection. Sweet, firm, and such purity of flavor! The oysters? Stunningly delicious.We moved on to Le Jardins du Printemps - the Garden of Spring. Made from carrot, roasted beet, parsnip puree, and microgreens, with dirt made of (IIRC) toasted rye. Playful, whimsical, and very, very flavorful. This is typical of all the food here - each individual component possesses such a purity of flavor, yet works seamlessly with the other components on the dish.Next came the Foie Gras, poached in milk with fried baby artichokes and crostini. Fabulous and, again, words cannot convey the visual and organoleptic appeal of these dishes.After a charming palate cleanser of while balsamic vinegar and house-made vanilla soda came the sous vide egg with celery root chips, legume sprouts and rye - out of this world!The Arctic Char was also cooked sous vide, then seared skin-side down, with a vanilla geld9e, licorice, fennel and asparagus that was phenomenally delicious. And following the fish, came the lamb tenderloin, served atop a purd9e of carrot, and served with baby carrot, coffee, and micro-greens. Excellent!A wonderful cheese course followed, and then the desserts. Pine branches in a pool of dry ice, flowing over the top of the table - pine-scented marshmallow lollipops .. followed by a series of Mignardises (or Treats) - a carrot-infused marshmallow (the only less-than-wonderful part of the meal), a tasty tidbit of fruit geld9e, milk chocolate ganache, and a thin bark of 73% dark chocolate dusted with raspberry powder.A breath-taking meal and one that (for me) firmly sets Atelier Crenn in that rarified atmosphere of the very best of San Francisco restaurants.', Thank you Chef Crenn for taking over this space and transforming it into a culinary wonderland. It's a casually elegant, rustic molecular gastronomy experience.CAUTION, this type of food is not for everyone, it's dainty, it's innovative, it's bordering on pretentious, but seriously, the decibels in the restaurant was bordering on deafening, it would NEVER get to level of true arrogance, as many of the finer establishments have a very restrained environment. Service was extremely gracious, knowledgeable and the gratitude of Chef Crenn was evident when she made rounds at each and every table. Word on the street is if a dish is a flop for the evening, it will be TOAST the next night.My favorites of the evening: the crostini amuse bouche, the chilled kir globes, perfectly crisped kale, the sous vide artic char, the root veggies in yogurt 'snow', the sheep's milk cheese & the uniquely crafted mignardises.The garden room in the back is more intimate and less rowdy, but I thought the lighting was a bit bright to be romantic. Items of improvement: timing of courses, we had the tasting menu, as did many others that evening and it took four hours. Our server was aware and apologetic of the timing-he generously comped an additional glass of chilled champagne for our patience.The food surprised me and the stories behind them brought a warmth to each dish. Glad Crenn has free reign at her own namesake, as she brings a creativity and strength to the SF food culture., 'I had heard so many good things about this place, so why was I so disappointed??? First, the food is truly art, so if you are looking for a visual experience, then this is your place! BUT...if you also wish to be fed, then maybe not so much... Portions are very small, and I could get over that if the food tasted half as good as it looked. Our pigeon was literally raw, the dish aptly called  The Sea had bits of crustacean that were clearly old and FISHY! The dish, a walk in the woods was actually very good and an excellent vegan alternative.The cost of the meal was inversely proportional to our satisfaction with it, so not a good thing! The high note was the service, it was exceptional. It was also a pleasure to meet with Chef Crenn at our table. Will I be back? Only if I win the lottery and loose my taste buds on the same day...', Fantastic! First off, the food is very conceptual and the portions are small, so if you want large portions go to Cheesecake Factory. The food is very high quality, wonderfully flavorful, fresh ingredients, and artistically presented. It is the most high-concept, artistic food we've had since Coi. The wine was also very interesting and, I'm glad to say, not overpriced either. The service was attentive without ever being intrusive. The dishes are complex so the staff does explain each dish, but otherwise they never intrude. And last but certainly not least, finally a restaurant with a good energy to it which isn't noisy! What a relief! Finally a fantastic restaurant where you don't have to shout to your dining companions. We just came back from our first meal there and will be back next week for a friend's bday party who is a big foodie and we know she will love it!, 'I have nothing but praise for this restaurant, this experience. From the moment I walked in the door, I felt like I was transported to another planet, a world where time moved more slowly, everyone acted with grace and the utmost attention, and I could forget all the complexities of life and be attended to. And that was before I had anything to eat or drink.The food here is art, conceived of and prepared with a quiet vivacious spirit, presented with (almost too much) seriousness, and absolutely perfect. I tend to overuse the word perfect, but this really was. In many ways, the Le Jardin of tiny vegetables with goat cheese snow epitomized the experience, as Chef Crenn treated these tiny morsels as if they were jewels and I was the recipient of the treasure.Brava Chef Crenn, an original talent, a gracious person, and someone who obviously cares passionately!', 'A great tasting menu experience. For whatever reason, I expect a much more traditional place, but Atelier Crenn did a great job of blending fresh-local-seasonal with molecular techniques in a recognizable French menu.We sat in the back room and watched the sky change colors with the sunset - it was a lot more mellow than the front room. Some highlights: - pate with alfalfa sprouts showed me what pairs with alfalfa sprouts - the kir Breton ball was solid molecular amuse bouche stuff - sous-vide prawn was perfectly cooked - soft texturally but not the same as raw shrimp. Served on a warm stone - simple carrots/beets/turnip salad all kinds of neat condiments - sous-vide salmon was amazing....perfectly soft. Like the shrimp, better than raw. The uni-carrot dressing was more carrot than uniStill, the desserts were truly amazing. We had a palate cleanser of a Douglas fir sorbet. It was served on an actual branch of douglas fir, and you ate the sorbet off of it. The branch was covered in natural oils, so holding it intensified the aroma. It came in a dry-ice metal container with more of the natural oils spilling out in the steam. Wow...it really was amazing.The carrot cake dessert was carrot cake rolled up and then surrounded by a carrot made of a paste made of carrots formed in the shape of a carrot. Wow! The pastry chef explained it all...seemed like a good guy.The petit-fours were all kinds of flavors served in a stone tray with a little bonsai tree. The pastry chef takes care of these himself.For $95, it really was worth it. It seemed a lot more relaxed and real than Benu and Coi. I just really liked it.', 'Dominique Crenn cooking at Luce made it one of the best restaurants in San Fran. I was expecting more and even better at her new Atelier however I was disappointed. At this price range, diners can and should expect the best and while this place is very good, its not at the level the pricing or the expectations set. The portions are small and the ingredients seem to be the lower cost parts of the animal. For example,one of my dishes was a very fatty and poorly executed lamb neck. The table next to us purchased a white truffle enhancement to their meal but they complained that the truffle was not up to snuff (literally didnt smell of truffle or of anything for that matter) and didnt taste good either. I was glad I didnt order it.The atmosphere was excellent although the time between the dishes was very long.I hope this place can improve to be at least as good as Luce was.', Great experience:- Food is truly art. Stunning. Get the 5 course meal - 3 is probably not enough and the complete 9 courser must leave one too full to stand up afterwards. - Desserts are among the most amazing that I've ever experienced. Worth going just for the $25 option to get all 3 desserts on the menu. The pastry chef Juan is a genius and in my opinion, his creations outshine by far the rest of the menu.- Service was exceptional.I thought of giving 4 stars because some of the plates were more difficult to enjoy but my date and I had such a great time that 5 stars were warranted. Oh yeah, sit in the front room - much better than the back., 'It was a total mind blow, eating at Dominique Crenn studio, for she truly is an artiste, more avant-garde or post-moderne than traditionelle or even nouvelle. Wee been fans since Luce and we are so happy she now has her own canvas on which to create. The staff was young and attractive, their welcome warm and sincere. Similarly, the millieu and mis en scene were tasteful, not too much, not too little, not too cool, not too precocious. There was a definite vibe going on and it was refreshing. Conscious of high intentions but not self conscious of anything. Considering the place opened just a few months ago, this staging was quite well done. The auteur came to say hello before the amuse bouche, which was the most substantial amuse Ie ever encountered. Four-five different demi-tastes served as primary washes for the work that would follow. We had ordered the five course menu and it was a good choice to review the oeuvre. They are, as rumored, high concept plates, presented in stark relief on cinder slates. Each course has a zen-like conciseness built into it, but by themselves together, they are perfectly satisfying and fulfilling. I had had a wonderful potato dish at Alain Ducasse in Paris which I thought was the most wonderful potato I had ever had. Hers comes close, and that is a high standard. You see each plate and the constituent ingredients don telegraph a lot of gastronomic anticipation by their looks (soil is merely a cheeky metaphor). Then you taste it and are immediately taken aback by the simplicity and utter purity of the organic matter your waiter had announced were actually in the dish. You wonder and you contemplate and you savor as if this were the first time you ate. Dessert was a fitting coda, refreshing and reflecting on what passed. Service was applied lightly yet attentively. Explanations of the owner intent freely given, easily understood. Not aloof or elitist in the least. But cordial, informed, effortless. Crenn, the realisatrice and star, has found the right supporting cast members who know their role. But I glean a bit of dinner theater going on here as well. It as if at Atelier Crenn, you, the diner, are both enthralled audience and giddy co-conspirator driving forward an intriguing culinary plot. It ends spectacularly well.', I went a month after they opened and it was the best meal I've had thus far in my life. 5 star presentation and service. The Chef was kind enough to show my party the kitchens, the private room and where the magical desserts are made. Truly a one of a kind experience no foodie should miss. I look forward to going back again for Spring. Thank you Chef!, If you're expecting a standard meal of steak and pom frites, you will be disappointed. The chef greeted our table twice, very considerate of dietary restrictions of the table. Exceptional table service. Everything timed perfectly. Almost theatre. No gimmicks.Must walk in with an open mind and an empty stomach. The food is art, so carefully prepared and presented it's almost a shame to put it in your mouth and decimate it. Thoughtful, creative, unexpected. Dishes with a Ph.D.The most unique meal I've ever had., 'My fiancd9e and I went to Atelier Crenn on tuesday, this was a recommendation from a friend who been there a few months ago and I have to say we were very impressed!Before deciding to go, I read some of the reviews and saw Dominique Crenn food was on the molecular side of the spectrum. When I think molecular gastronomy, I think Coi, partially because Ie very much enjoyed dining at Coi and partially because Coi is the only restaurant Ie been to that practices those techniques -- gels, bubbles, foams, etc... -- so heavily. So, it likely that there will be a number of references to Coi throughout this review because that sort of what I had in mind when I got there, which is probably unfair and all, but eh, that how these things go.We had a reservation for 8:45 but were hungry so we showed up at 8:30 and were seated immediately. As we walked in the first thing I noticed, and commented on, was that the dining room was fairly loud which was not a very good start. This wasn a good start, when I dine in this type of establishment I expect a more subdued ambiance, a quiet evening, bathed in soft lighting and the aromas of delicious foods and wines. This isn quite how the meal started, mary and I sat down at a table on the side, in between 2 other couples. I would honestly have preferred a slightly more isolated and mostly a quieter setting. We both debated on why the place was so loud, whether it was the crowd, whether it was the bare concrete floors and bare walls, whether it was just because there were just too many tables -- the place was nearly full when we showed up -- and eventually concluded that it was probably all of the above. After a few minutes of this, we got used to it and started looking at the short, 2 pages menu. Mary is not a fan of tasting menus, she always finds them too daunting but, this one apparently didn scare her and there were even a few items she was very excited about -- foie gras is her pd9chd9 mignon -- which made me very happy.So, off we went with the tasting menu and bottle of red wine recommended by the sommelier who was very kind and recommended bottles in all price ranges, without us asking: the recommendations ranged in prices from 60 to 400$ and we ended up with a delicious 2006 burgundy.Before we picked the wine, the amuse bouche arrived, yes, we were taking our sweet time to pick the wine. The amuse bouche, served on a slate plate, consisted of a little metal spoon with frozen pea soup pearls, foie gras nibs with rose petals and a rose gel (as far as I remember), and a little wood branch with 2 chips (I can remember what the chips were made of) with a little bit of wasabi sauce on top of the chips. The soup and the foie gras were absolutely delicious and oh so very decadent, the chip I wasn a huge fan of, mostly a bit too salty for my taste, but I am notoriously sensitive to salt, my fiancd9e, who less sensitive than me didn mind the salt at all, on the contrary. ;)After the amuse bouche came something crazy...another rectangular piece of slate with 2 little yellow round spheres with a red paste on top...at that point, we had no idea what to do with those things but the waiter nicely explained that these were the kir breton and that they came with eating instructions, namely: delicately pick these up with your fingers, gently place them on your tongue and close you mouth completely before biting. OK, I don mind instructions, I actually find it kinda funny when there are instructions but the part about completely closing our mouth (he literally said that) was a tad over the top. Regardless of the overthetopness, we followed the directions, gently picked up the spheres, gently placed the spheres in our respective mouths, and then closed our respective mouths fully before biting...then...once we did actually bite, something wonderful happened: a crazy explosion of cider! OK, other people might have described the kir breton but I didn bother reading those comments...anyhow, the chef, Dominique, later came by and we asked her what that madness was all about and she explained that these were cocoa butter spheres filled with cider and topped with a fruit (I believe it was blackberry) jam. This was even more surprising and exciting than it was tasty!OK, now in the hope to not make a full novel out of this review, and also to let people discover some of those dishes for themselves, I going to shorten the review and just highlight some of the dishes that I really liked.Now yelp yelling at me because this review so long so I going to skip ahead: the oyster and shrimp was delicious, the artic char with carrot foam, fava beans and licorice was incredible, the pigeon was terrific.OK, gotta cut it short: the real star of the show was the dessert. Juan, the pastry chef is a mad genius, his interpretation of olives left us speechless...can describe it I only have 20 characters left but go find out for yourself, NOW!', 'Atelier Crenn puts the un in fun. While nearly everything tasted good (except the freeze-dried pea soup) nobody in the joint seemed to be having a good time. While It obvious that a lot of planning, work and practice has gone into each plate, somehow the joy gone missing - maybe it at the bottom of that tank of liquid nitrogen. The couple next to us couldn even conjure a smile when their silly desserts arrived on smoking logs (very Twin Peaks). Bottom line: we came expecting experimental indulgence but left feeling a bit grumpy, although I give it 2 1/2 stars if Yelp allowed.', 'Our friends Joyce and Ravi ate here back in Feb and raved about Chef Crenn latest restaurant. Their only regret was ordering the 3-4 course menu rather than the Chef Tasting Menu. I made 6pm reservations for Kevin Birthday and our entire table ordered the Chef Tasting Menu. Kevin also opted for the Beer & Wine Pairing. To our surprise Chef Crenn came out and personally greeted our table and wished my husband a Happy Birthday. -(*)Kir Breton was served on a dark slate plate. We were instructed to lift the plate and place the entire sphere in out mouths then to bite down. What a refreshing pop of cider. -Trio of foie gras, cold pea soup & pate-Oyster and Prawn. The prawn is served atop a stone and oysters are brought out separately on a bed of grass. -(*)Le Jardins du Printemps was an array of small carrots, beets parsnip puree-Celery: Egg, legume sprouts and rye. Once served, the egg yolk is broken and mixed together with all of the ingredients. -(*)Foie Gras which appeared to be frozen with creme and then shaved into long creamy thin strands. I could eat this everyday. It was truly a unique take on foie gras as most other places will serve it seared or torchon.-Arctic Char Liquorice, uni-Pigeon-We skipped the cheese course-(*)The desserts kept coming. It was a perfect closer to a wonderful 3 hour dinner. We had an ice cream served popsicle style on pine needles. Stuffed carrot cake. Medley of caramels, chocolate served next to a mini bonsai tree. (*) = favoritesAt under $100/pp this is a definite must for dining in San Francisco. We enjoyed Atelier Crenn better than Coi.', Not for everyone and not for people on budget, but what an experience. I went with 2 other people and we each brought a very nice bottle of wine. I read in an article that their wine list was way overpriced and we were OK with the $40 corkage fee.The service was impeccable, but the ambiance was very sterile and maybe too intimate. we had a good time and were the only people laughing and having a good time. The food was an EXPERIENCE. i don't think you can call it French food by my standards, but more avant guarde French fusion. We chose the 10 course menu and everything was surprising, tasty, redefining culinary boundaries, and went very well with the awesome wines we brought. it was pricey but an experience like no other, hence the 5 stars. again not for everyone, but if you are going in good company, don't mind the sad people around you and willing to experience something totally different, then i would highly recommend it. when you spend that kind of money, you have to have a little bit of faith, we did and we all agreed it was a great experience. would i go back? not anytime soon for budget reasons but if you want to impress a business cabinet, a date or propose to someone, that is a good place to go., 'Fucking good food. very unique.', 'In a few words this is 21st century cooking at its best. Our entire group had 8 course tasting menu and we were blown away practically by every course. Sophisticated, well presented, thought out, this was truly amazing. Dining at Atelier Crenn IS an experience, and although it felt like we always had something on the table our dinner took 4 hours. The service is unobtrusive and elegant. Not Il stand behind your back and watch you move like in many restaurants of the same caliber. From what I understand the menu is changing quite often, no reason to write about the food items other than the fact that they were the most innovative and best presented. Everything tasted incredibly good.Pastry chef is nuts. In a good way. What he does with desserts is in league of its own. Also, for what we paid, I feel like wee gotten a deal. Seriously, this place is not inexpensive but they could easily charge more.', This review is way overdue. I kind of stopped writing reviews for a while, but I feel that I have to write this one, because people need to be warned.We spent $500 here, for 4 people, no dessert, and we brought our own wine. It's not unusual for us to spend this much on a dinner, but it was definitely unusual for us to go to Pizza Orgazmica next door right after because all of us were starving! I wish I wrote this review right after I came home, because all the details would have still been fresh in my mind.  The food is not bad, but the portions are so tiny! They are not even appetizer size portions! And I have been to France. I ate my way through France! Portions there are at least 3 times bigger than at this restaurant! So if they are trying to be French, I'm sorry, this is not French! I don't know what this is, but for the price, the portion size is simply unacceptable. They don't even have bread here! I usually don't eat bread in a restaurant, because I want to leave room for real food, but bread at this restaurant would have been God send! I could just feel my metabolism slowing down throughout this meal! Presentation of the food was creative however, but who cares about that when you're starving right? Another reason we were starving is because we spent over 3 hours there for dinner. I think the chef was teasing us. Bringing out one tiny plate per person per hour. I am not kidding. And they have their own house water there, sparkling and regular, no bottled water. Supposedly it's filtered. It is not! It tasted like chlorine! And guess what? We were charged for it, per glass! I think it was either $5 or $8 per glass, I don't really remember.So I really don't understand all these positive reviews. These people are either 1) paid to write these reviews, 2) friends of the owner, or 3) anorexic., 'Atelier Crenn is the best restaurant to open in San Francisco this year, and easily one of the top five restaurants in the city. We just ate there for our second time, and all I can say is that I was blown away by the experience. What was even more impressive is that the food has gotten even better and more creative since our last visit over two months ago. The service was outstanding, and the tasting menu, with the wine pairings could not have been any better. The price, while high, was entirely reasonable for this quality of experience.On this visit we brought a relative who was visiting us from New York, and his comment to us was that if the restaurant was located in New York it would be impossible to get a reservation for two months. We are so fortunate to have this gem of a restaurant right in our own back yard.Let me add that over the last 20 years, my wife and I have eaten at some of the best restaurants in the world. While some of them have lived up to what the critics said, others were huge disappointments. Not only did Atelier Crenn live up to the comments we have heard from others, it far exceeded them. As a sidelight, what I found really amusing was that after our meal, my wife asked me if I had read the review of a food critic who writes for a San Francisco newspaper who gave a very positive, but not a glowing review to Atelier Crenn. When she mentioned his name, I smiled, and reminded her that that was the same guy who had sent us to a score of disappointing restaurants for several years until I finally gave up reading his reviews and made my decisions after reading postings on Open Table and Yelp. One great thing about the internet is that we can all make intelligent decisions ourselves on where to eat, without relying on the personal and sometimes very wrong impressions of a single reviewer.', 'Whimsical. Playful. Delicious. Those are the 3 words I would use to describe my meal at Atelier Crenn. Their nondescript menu supposedly allows the diner to just enjoy the experience without overthinking it too much. Personally, I think that crap. I like to know the what and how when it comes to my food. (Chalk it up to my science background. I curious enough as it is. Throw molecular gastronomy in the mix and my mind explodes!) But I had such a fun and enjoyable experience that I willing to overlook this. The food was delicious and landscaped dishes works of art...The AMUSE BOUCHE of frozen pea soup, beet meringue, and mushroom consomme (yelp.com/biz_photos/c3kh43_) was such a fun way to start the meal and perfectly set the tone for what to come. We started with the LE JARDIN AND ITS SOIL (yelp.com/biz_photos/c3kh43_) and ARTICHOKE (yelp.com/biz_photos/c3kh43_). Being a huge meat-lover, I was all that excited about these dishes, particularly the former since it was just a bunch of raw veggies.I really started to get into the food with the meat-containing dishes. The perfectly cooked SWEETBREADS (yelp.com/biz_photos/c3kh43_) were great with the broccolini and yummy smoked ham hock broth. I eat a lot of FOIE GRAS (yelp.com/biz_photos/c3kh43_) and this was one of the best Ie had! Sous vide, frozen, then seared to order, it was not only perfectly cooked but maintained the most structural integrity of any foie Ie had--it didn break apart nor was there much oil oozing out as I cut into it. The buttery and melt-in-my-mouth foie gras was topped with crushed hazelnuts, which added the perfect textural contrast and just the right amount of saltiness.Although the WALK IN THE FOREST (yelp.com/biz_photos/c3kh43_) was meatless, I was amazed at how good it was. Underneath a variety of mushrooms prepared using different methods (e.g. pickled, roasted) was a large smear of toasted meringue, whose sweetness and caramelized flavours went perfectly with the earthy and tangy fungi. I scraped my fork thoroughly over my plate to make sure I got it all. (If I was alone, I woulde licked my plate.) THE SEA (yelp.com/biz_photos/c3kh43_), consisted of bite-size morsels of prawns, mussels, sea urchin, abalone, oyster, and squid dumplings. All the seafood was incredibly fresh and their flavours really came through. (The prawn was so prawn-y!) The very unique squid dumplings were like squid-flavoured gnocchi with a stickier consistency. I really want to know how they were made!The LAMB (yelp.com/biz_photos/c3kh43_) and PIGEON (yelp.com/biz_photos/c3kh43_) were both perfectly seasoned and cooked--so tender and juicy!--and the accompaniments worked well with them too. We also got the ARTIC CHAR (yelp.com/biz_photos/c3kh43_) from the Tasting Menu. (Bonus points to them for being flexible about that!) Unfortunately, this was the most uninspired dish of the night--basically just a piece of fish covered with foam and some fava beans. Gently cooking it sous vide meant that certain qualities of raw fish were maintained, which I thought I would be a fan of; however, it lacked textural contrast and I missed the flakiness from conventionally-cooked fish. It was like eating a giant piece of underseasoned sashimi. I didn care much for the foam and fava beans either.Luckily, our meal returned to form with the desserts. All 3 were all amazing! And none of them were overly sweet. The COCONUT RHUBARB (yelp.com/biz_photos/c3kh43_) topped with shaved ice was so refreshing. By far the most whimsical dish of the night was the moist and flavourful CARROT CAKE (yelp.com/biz_photos/c3kh43_), which came in the form of an actual carrot. The cake was *inside* the carrot! (See picture: yelp.com/biz_photos/c3kh43_) And the pea sorbet totally worked with it. The CHOCOLATE, PISTACHIO, PEAR dessert (yelp.com/biz_photos/c3kh43_) was just as fun and tasty. What looked like green moss with a bunch of brown rocks was actually a light and airy chiffon cake with soft frozen chocolate mousse. This was great with the juicy and slightly crunchy pears.I can wait to come back to see what else Chefs Crenn and Contreras has up their sleeves!', 'I went here with my dad at my girlfriend recommendation, and had a fantastic meal. We both ordered the 4-courser, but thankfully got to ogle the 10-course meal that the people at the table next to us ordered. The menu is a bit thin on description, which is fantastic, because it tells you just enough to know if youl like the ingredients in the dish without spoiling the surprise of how artfully it presented. For example, the dessert we got was Chocolate, Pistachio, and Pear, and what arrived was like a little microcosm of forest with each ingredient made to look like a log, or moss, etc.One of my favorite things was actually the chef appetizer, which was a beet merengue that, when you ate it, just melted in your mouth and released an intense and enjoyable beet flavor. The foie gras and pickled beet (I like beets, as you can tell) was also amazing.Service-wise, we had no complaints. Everyone was friendly, and they even seated us well in advance of our reservation time when we showed up early. The front of the restaurant seemed like a bit nicer place to sit than the back where we were, but when the food comes out you kind of forget about things like that.', 4.5 stars.I think other Yelpers did an amazing job describing the uniqueness of each dish and the artistic ingenuity of Chef Crenn. All I can say is, every time I finished a course, I couldn't wait to see what was next. My taste buds, visual senses, and stomach were all pampered that night. Chef Crenn made her rounds and was very lovely.. it was evident she has put her heart and soul into her restaurant. Two things I would change: (1) portion size--if only the main courses were as big as the desserts! But as a woman, I think Chef Crenn knows what's most important haha ;)(2) the garden room--it didn't have the same ambiance as the main dining room and still smelled of paint.. we requested to be moved to the main dining room because of it.Our server was FANTASTIC and really made our dinner so, so enjoyable. Highly recommended.. just come with an open mind! :), Ok, I'm just going to say it at the risk of showing my true colors. I don't get it. Fluff, foam and fog. And logs. Beautiful yet confusing, and I didn't leave satiated.Tons of appreciable artistry, and I totally understand the overhead given that the staff is at least 1::1. Yet I'm afraid to tell my husband how much I spent on dinner here with my GF's! (Including those two bottles of wine)Definitely not a sustainable model for a restaurant. More of a guest appearance or a pop up shop. I feel like I should be given a tax deduction for my support of the arts., Absolutely phenomenal culinary experience. Poetic culinary is the right description. You will question, learn and be surprised by every bite. The full tasting menu (10 courses, 3+ hours) is the way to go. Can't wait to go back., 'I haven written a Yelp review in a very long time ... Atelier Crenn was so amazing that I had to jump on and write one immediately. I would have given 6 stars if I had the chance. This is in my top 3 of SF dining - absolutely wonderful.We did the 4 course menu w wine pairing - yes, the courses are small. But the food is so thoroughly thought through - and the wine that they pair with it is also on point. All of the food is beautifully presented -it makes you want to look at it - I was a food voyeur and was scoping the chef tasting at the table next to us. My first course was a potato dish - very interesting combinations or potato, snap pea, parmesan ... every bite came together perfectly.The foie gras w Riesling pairing is the hands down the best Ie ever had. The pork was perfectly cooked - as was the pork belly. I selected the cheese course for dessert - my only complaint of the entire night is that the Austrian Riesling they paired with it was just good, not great.I recommend this place to anyone and everyone. It is also great to see a creative and innovative restaurant in Cow Hollow/Marina.', WOW.Dominique Crenn hits it out of the park. Food that is smart, playful and pleasing to the eye. And delicious!Wine pairings that are generally very good to excellent.Service that is attentive but unobtrusive.Only downside is a space that is a little too small (making me worried about the business model) and too loud for an upscale dining experience.Unusual neighborhood for this type of restaurant, and I hope it survives. I'm doing my part having gone there twice in 2 weeks!, 'Mlle. Proust in Cow Hollow - Atelier Crenn - San Francisco Often young chefs find a horsey-style and ride it, but not so Dominique Crenn who is working with flair to harness her own vision. She has been in the industry for some 23 years, and perhaps young is a matter less of chronology than the fact that she only reached wide gastronomic notice in 2008 when she became chef at San Francisco Luce, received a Michelin star, and was named Esquire chef of the year. She has since triumphed on Iron Chef, which might or might not testify to her vision, but certainly to her culinary chops. The menu includes a moving (and somewhat ambiguous) letter to her father, talking about pain and sun, surf and sweat. As with so much poetry, readers have much to read in, but one can hardly imagine a male chef making the claim that his cuisine is such a personal and private expression, a way of reliving the past, whether troubled or happy.  Ultimately reviews are about the food. Critics are often asked, reasonably, how good was it? Asking that of Crenn is a bit like asking that of, say, Eva Hesse or Robert Rauschenberg: they don easily fit on a 30-point scale. They are important artists with a vision that might or might not appeal and techniques that might or might not be proficient. The most obvious limitation of Crenn (and for that matter Rauschenberg) is that her dishes are not noted for their precision. If you admire Thomas Keller perfection on a plate, this falls short of that standard. Perhaps Crenn doesn have the staff, but I think she doesn have the desire. Memory doesn work like that. She is attempting to produce remembrance and reverie. Whether she succeeds is as much a function of the diner as of the cook. We began with a quite lovely and evocative amuse: a spoonful of freeze-dried split pea soup, a bloody-dried beet kiss, an intense bit of fungal broth, and an non-edible boulder. It was quite a stunning composition: possibly Freudian, but perhaps freeze-dried split pea soup is simply freeze-dried split pea soup. The consommd9 was properly intense, the beet was deeply flavored - a root with a zing. The bright freeze dried pea soup didn wow my tongue. The crumbly texture added little to the enjoyment of the flavor, but distracted a bit. My opening course (diners can choose any three dishes from the savory portion of the menu) was a Walk in the Forest, a composition of textures and aromas of the wild. I imagined that it was going to be similar to David Kinch iconic Into the Vegetable Garden salad, a bowl of local surprises. It wasn quite. The plate was coated with a pine paste (a surprisingly sticky and sweet paste, more keeping with dessert), covered with various forms of mushrooms, the raw and the cooked and the pickled: a delicious black trumpet mushroom paper, picked and pickled morels, champignons, added were hazelnuts, chestnuts, tiny lettuces, toasted pumpernickel, and sorrel oil. I was glad to have selected the dish and I surely will remember it, but I don quite know what to make of it. As a culinary matter, it was somewhat too sweet and too pickled (Crenn seems to enjoy the tang of pickling). The plate was remarkably creative as an idea, and just a bit off as culinary practice. My second plate was poetically entitled, The Sea, An Interpretation of Aquatic Flavors: Mussels, Oysters, and Arctic Char. As I have previously suggested, the modernist style of dessert is to present the diner with a mix of preparations. The Sea, not so sweet as the previous dish, had this same decentered quality. Crenn prepared abalone, smoked oyster, char, mussels, squid ink meringue, and dehydrated lemon foam. It was quite charming in its ingredients and preparations and beautiful in its presentation. However, not having lived Crenn life, I wondered about the poetic imagery of the dehydrated foam. What might it signify? Still, it was a very worthy dish: a collection of satisfactions. My main protein was more standard: Duck with crispy skin, spring garlic, strawberry, rhubarb and smoked buckwheat. Crenn duck was exuberant. It was an excellent use of big protein. I particularly admired how she sprinkled toasted buckwheat on the plate as if buckwheat was salt. Crenn duck was a special preparation, well within the modernist canon.Finally dessert (from pastry chef Juan Contreras) was a witty trompe leil: a carrot cake with spring pea cream. The joke was that the cake was within the hunky frosted carrot with tiny carrots and frozen peas as accompaniments. Perhaps the cake itself tasted no better than a routine carrot cake and the cream was more clever than wondrous, but still it was a pleasurable ending to a most distinctive meal. When a chef is still at work in the kitchen and the ideas are bubbling and bouncing, Atelier Crenn stands a good chance of being a better restaurant in December than it was in June. Even now it is a restaurant that is always thought-provoking and vibrant.', can't describe how amazing dominique's dishes were, she's got talent all right. food came out with creative presentation and taste was marvelous to the palette, she knows her molecular gastronomy which is not something to be found in every dish along the way at other restaurants . this is definitely added to my favorites list of restaurants to go, we ordered the tasting menu and it was a very good experience. On top of that, service was very attentive even when the place was packed., Sorry it's a delayed review. But I still remember the artistic creations made by Chef Crenn, who came to my table 3 times to chat with my family, very kindly. All the dishes served on my table are beautiful, delicious, and some even surprisingly playful, like the dessert courses. Dishes I love the most are the oyster with seaweeds, foie gras log, and the green multi-layered palate cleanser. Now the portions are not that tiny. My son couldn't finish the olive ice-cream because he's too full!Overall a truly wonderful meal. To be nitpicky I would say the only dish that I don't care much about is the avocado and popcorn., Take a look at my review history. You'll see that I don't give out 5-stars lightly. And, you'll see that I've eaten a lot of food. A lot of good food. A lot of expensive food. In a lot of fancy places. All over the world. With that said, my dinner last week at Atelier Crenn was one of the best meals I've ever had in my life. Yes, it was beautiful, but more importantly, it actually tasted great. So often, these fancy restaurants serve food that clearly has no love behind it, no intention behind it, and it tastes like crap. It was clear to me that this restaurant is a labor of love. I felt cared for the entire time, the service was great, the atmosphere was serene, and the love and intention behind the food came through with bursting flavor and energy. I will be back, with friends!|2
9|atera-new-york|I don't want to ruin the fun for you. Go here NOW. Best meal of my life? The only place cooking like this in New York City for sure. So much heart, such delicious food, beverages, service., This was a disappointing experience. The service, long story short, greatly diminished the meal. The restaurant is set up in a bar configuration, with one table for 5 in the corner. The cooking happens behind the bar, as does most service. With this sort of configuration, a conviviality between guest and host is expected. The service was dry, impersonal, and slightly rushed. Meals at other restaurants of this caliber have, in my experience, been filled with informational, jovial and exciting exchanges with servers and other staff, a necessary and enhancing element to the evening. Servers seemed reluctant to engage in conversation about the (often) cerebral offerings, and that, coupled with the fact that, frankly speaking, it's extremely awkward to comment on food with companions (part of the fun of the meal!) when the kitchen staff is yards away, created a silent, joyless, and mildly arrogant experience. Some dishes were revelatory. Wine pairings, fantastic. Overall experience, an avoidable miss., 'After some recent high-end disappointments in regards to price:quality ratio (Eleven Madison Park, Daniel), the streak was finally broken at Atera. Friendly staff who don have a stick up their ass, reasonable wine mark-ups, and the food make the $150 price tag worth it. Every course was good, with about 3 being truly memorable.... maybe only 1 I call perfect but the quantity of near-perfect compensating for it.Probably my best overall high-end meal in NYC since Per Se a few years ago.I agree with a previous poster about being slightly pushy on drink refills - trying to push a 2nd glass of red while we are halfway through our final savory course?? Lame. However, you will like the staff better than at other similarly priced restaurants as they aren afraid to show some personality.', 'I went back to Atera a couple of Fridays ago and had another amazing time. I completely agree with previous reviewers that the friendly staff really make the experience. There is a significant problem at NYC fine dining restaurants with staff and chef (even at some venerable counter-seating fine dining establishments where chefs are right in front of customers) rude/cold/annoyed/nasty/hostile behavior. This shocks me. A restaurant is not a food temple. I am coming to eat dinner, not to pay homage at the altar of anyone ego. Thankfully, I cannot say enough nice things about the staff and the chefs at Atera. I estimate that more than half of what I had this time was different than the last time I visited in March (both new dishes and old dishes with new components). This is impressive. Of the new items, I especially liked the lobster roll, the halibut with whey and chamomile, the pork with wheatberries, the frozen strawberry shortcake, the ice cream sandwich, and a cold crab and crab/shrimp/lobster? gelee dish. I also really enjoyed the butter which was house made and flavored with Winnimere cheese. I did not like the squid noodles. I imagine that if I liked squid in noodle form, this would have been great, but I don, so it wasn. The broth was nice. Just a couple of brief comments:1. The milk punch cocktail that I had for the snacks portion of the meal was great. I would love more cocktails incorporated into the beverage pairing. 2. I opted to have the additional cheese course: the apple bread was fresh and flavorful, but I am used to a more composed cheese course. That being said, the selection was well chosen. Parting thought - lots of things were even better than my first visit. The foie gras peanut was soft and spreadable, not rock hard, etc. I can tell this is a team that cares about getting a little bit better every day. I appreciate that ethos.', 'Il Have Another..scratched from The Belmont Stakes. DOH!! My friend Tod, now with no prospect of witnessing horse racing history, thusly decided to forgo his flight from Chicago. I had intended to treat him to dinner at the new Atera, in the former Tribeca space, Compose. So, I had to scramble to find a willing replacement. Fortunately, my lovely friend Victoria (never call her Vic or Vicky) stepped up to the plate last minute and joined me in Chef Matthew Lightner new inner sanctum of modern gastronomy. Having staged at the World #1 Noma in Copenhagen and #3 Mugaritz in Spain and then at his award winning Campagna in Portland, Oregon, Lightner harnessed these experiences and crafted a unique oasis that has made quite the initial splash in the NYC restaurant scene showcasing the trendy New Naturals culinary movement. Though a minute space, Atera is the antidote for claustrophobics with its vaulted ceiling and airy comfortable dining room. Adam Platt (NY Magazine) cites the frosted windows shield the dimly lit room from the outside world, and in the evenings, the entrance of the eye-and-ear clinic next door is hidden behind thick green curtains. One entire wall is covered with an arrangement of potted plants designed to look like foliage in a wild forest, and diners nibble at their omakase dinners at a slate-colored bar, which is made from polished concrete and built around the gleaming open kitchen, like the bridge of a ship. High-end counter dining is quite the fashion these days and Atera holds its own with the likes of the Momofuku Kos and Brooklyn Fares. Atera offers a 10-course foraging tasting menu at $150. The tasting includes an introductory parade of snacks or amuses which were a mix of hits and misses. The highlights of these mini-bites were a delightful duet of Stuffed Jerusalem Artichoke Skins with Buttermilk, Brassica Flowers and Chickweed. Foie Gras, liquefied, then frozen, then molded into the form of a peanut was a guilty pleasure. Meringue Lobster Roll Sliders were a tiny, tantalizing tease. I could have done without the Mojave-dry Malt Cracker and Savory Black Sesame Granola. They basically tasted like Wheat Thins made out of bark..from a dead tree. Finishing the opening snacks was a clever faux Razor Clam shell made from dried bread and painted with black squid ink to mimic the striations on the shell. Stuffed with ocean fresh sliced clams, this dish just embodied all the smells and tastes of the sea. Atera has a vast wine list at moderate to expensive prices. To save a bit on the tab, try some of the more reasonable in-house cocktails like the Vesper with Gin, Vodka, Pineau des Charantes and Cardamom or the addictive Milk Punch. The service at Atera is extremely choreographed and efficient. One never waits for the next course. Chef Lightner makes the time to converse with his guests when the opportunity presents itself. The main event commenced with a hypnotic presentation of Yogurt, Shad Roe, Rhubarb and Licorice..a plating the likes I haven witnessed since Corton. This makes sense because Sous Chef Victoria Blamey worked with the eccentric genius Chef Paul Liebrandt for a time as well at Mugaritz alongside Lightner. Don mess with this woman..she is ALL business on the line..the epitome of cool in the kitchen with the focus and concentration of a laser eye surgeon. Diver Scallops with Yuzu, Gin Botanicals and Pickled Green Strawberries were a delicate balance of joy and artistry. Victoria and I were absolutely inamorate of the awesome Peeky-Toe Soft Shell Crab, Toasted Shrimp and Angelica Root Geld9e. I had read raves about the Squid with Cured Lardo and a Squid-Pork Sauce, but was disappointed to discover it was not being served on this night. We did get the squid in noodle form in a broth that was just satisfactory. I needed something to cheer me up and the Dried Beet with Trout Roe and Crustacean Sauce was just what the doctor ordered. How Lightner can make a beet impersonate a mini fillet mignon in look and texture is beyond me. It was brilliant. An all-white plate of Halibut, Garlic, Whey and Chamomile reminded me of Inaki Aizpitarte wizardry at Le Chateaubriand in Paris. Squab and Pheasant Black Mushroom Sauce, Pear and Tarragon were delicate and memorable. The last of the savory plates was a luscious and fatty Mangalista Pork Fillet with Wheatberries, Lamb Quarters and Prickly Ash Moutarde. Desserts at Atera are whimsical. Meyer Lemon and Wild Ginger Cream encased in a shell resembling a rock with green moss was a fine palate cleanser. A modern, modular take on Strawberry Shortcake looked like something out of a Frank Lloyd Wright design. A Parsley Root Banana Split with Marshmallow brought us back to our childhood. A play on a Mexican style churro with Salsify, White Cardamom and Cinnamon followed by caramels and truffles meticulously carved to duplicate hazelnuts and walnuts closed this inspiring meal. Dinner for two with drinks, tax and tip was $525.', It was a truly exceptional. Started with a cocktail (milk punch) which is the best drink I have tried in NYC and wish I could begin every meal with one. My favorite was their version of ramen - which was squid in the form of noodles in an amazing broth. The lobster roll starter between 2 meringue cookies as well as mini quail eggs with foie gras peanuts and a faux razor clam edible shell stuffed with diced clams were the highlights of the snacks. The halibut was incredible as a savory course. The dried beet in rock form with trout roe and sea urchin emulsion was probably the most unique and interesting to devour. Only 2 courses of 22 I did not LOVE - one being sweetbreads and the other a frozen horseradish mustard flavored marshmallow starter, that was just too cold and spicy for my liking.Very brooklyn fare-esque with the concrete, communal u-shaped counter. Only difference (other than BYO) which I enjoyed more about BF, was that there are 2 distinct seatings. At Atera, when I sat down diner to the right (line chef at EMP) was on course 18 so it takes some of the surprise and silence upon first collective bite out of the experience. That being said, the presentation was more inventive, the food very forager with everything playful in presentation and taking on the earthy theme (served on rocks, looked like rocks etc.), but the taste lived up to all the hype. Even the bread and butter was worthy of a course. I was stuffed and hoping to only want a taste of the desserts but they were some of the best i've ever had and completely cleared my plate for all 5 courses of them. Ice cream sandwiches and decomposed strawberry shortcake being the standouts., 'I realized something early on during my dinner at Atera. For the first time ever, the food that I was eating made me laugh. Ie had many amazing meals in my life -- meals that have left me satisfied and speechless. But laughter? It was a novel sensation.First were snacks - and for a meal such as this one, the beverage pairing, of course. A chilled beer and cheese macaron. The faintest of beer tastes. Creamy cheese. Somewhat cumbersome to eat with your fingers. Next came a crisp flax seed cookie. For me, the next two bites were truly spectacular. Dried sunchoke skin wrapped around fresh sheep milk cheese, garnished with some green leaves and yellow flowers. Too beautiful to eat. Then a lobster roll baguette - the baguette made out of wheat flour. Amazing, again. A horseradish parfait followed, with some halibut and dried mustard. This one was also chilled. The tangy kick from the horseradish. It was interesting, certainly, because I had tasted nothing like it.Next came one of the prettiest dishes of the evening, and one that is already considered a signature one. A foie gras peanut on a little wooden slab. A pickled, creamy quail egg, nested over some grass in a wooden box. Crispy malt cracker over a stone. Presentation was just phenomenal. The laughter was just beginning.Another highlight followed -- what appeared to be an entire razor clam, shell included. The entire thing was edible -- raw clam and clam emulsion. More laughter. Almost too clever.To conclude the snack portion of the meal - a lichen chip with herb butter, which was over a bed of stones.The first of the main dishes was a colorful panache of flowers -- beneath was monkfish roe with a sourdough puree. Too beautiful to eat, but alas, it had to be eaten. Three types of textures here -- the puree, the pop from the roe, and those beautiful flowers and greens. Next came raw almonds, something that definitely brought a smile to my face as I grew up with an almond tree in my backyard. Almond milk. Came wrapped in a boiled milk fat crepe. One of the highlights for sure. Diver scallops with pickled green tomatoes. Icy pieces of pickled tomato vinegar (perhaps) with seeds, jutted from the bed of scallops. This came with some sake, served in a delicious wooden cup. With each sip, you could smell the wonderful timber.Finally, some bread. Homemade rye bread, with the most delicious butter I have ever had -- it was steeped in some of type of cheese. I mean, just amazing. The bread was served with what would turn out to be my least favorite of the dishes. The peeky toe crab with snap peas was tasty, but alas, I was no fan of the ginger gelee that came with it. Just an odd texture that I did not particularly care for. But, I loved the pairing - one of the fruitiest white wines from the Loire Valley that I have ever had.Test tubes of chicken broth followed. A bowl of ramen, with a dissolvable spice packet that featured a roasted shallot and herbs. The ramen was extremely al dente. But I won spoil anything. I loved this dish.The bread - sourdough bathed in pork fat. Now, a disclosure. I hate mushrooms. But these morel morsels, if you will, served with a pine nut gravy, were delicious. Next, beet ember, with a smoked layer of sorts. Trout roe. Crustacean sauce (with test tube). Lovely.Next, one of the most divine dishes I have ever had in my life. Halibut with young garlic and whey. Dandelion buds. And more importantly, chamomile essence - like tea. This dish just reminded me of spring. Perfectly floral and refreshing, the complete opposite of the stifling dog days of summer outside. Sweetbreads with toffee sauce. I don love sweetbreads, but the sauce was amazing. Finally, a beef strip loin with thinly sliced mushrooms on top, which had been steeped in pickled bone marrow. Sublime, and I hate mushrooms and bone marrow.The desserts were perfect. Rose water ice and floral sorbet. Peach gel with peach pit shaped toffee sorbet. Strawberry shortcake. Churros with real Nutella. An ice cream sandwich.Service was impeccable and the servers would leave you alone if you didn want to be bothered -- or, if you were chatty, they were more than happy to talk to you about the food and drink. Mr. Lightner calmly conducted the symphony.Now, I was able to get a reservation 3 days in advance, but that atypical - hint, if you want to eat at the hardest tables in NYC, go during a holiday weekend when everyone is out of town. Otherwise, expect to book 2 months in advance, and it will only get harder once Mr. Wells of the Times gives Atera 3 stars at least (although I think it worthy of 4).Atera is an absolutely magical dining experience and was one of the greatest meals of my life. It does indeed break the bank, although still cheaper than some of the other restaurants of similar caliber. Whenever I in need of some Epicurean laughter in this greatest of cities, I know where to go.', Sublime.Move over Keller, Humm and the rest of the gang, there is a new player and it is superb. I cant help but say that there is a very good chance that Atera is New York's next BEST restaurant.Somewhat odd location gives way to a going down the rabbit hole feeling however once inside the perfection is made quite apparent. You will be seated at a wide and roomy horseshoe with 12 or 13 dining guests around you close enough to strike up conversation with your fellow diners yet just far enough away to make you feel at points as though its your restaurant.There is an immediate sense of theatre as the diners are set up in an audience manner with the kitchen and all of its players the performers. Though within seconds it is clear that its all interactive. You the diner and the members of the Atera team are quickly on the same side of the experience its just that you receive and they think, design, execute and deliver.The food is creative, precise, fun, genius and easy all at once. You will feel very sophisticated one minute, child like the next and then seduced the next...all the while invited to think over and over.The service is exceptional without being overbearing. Ive only seen this at Atelier Crenn in Sf in that the staff is perfectly trained but beyond that they are not just performing but also relating to you as an individual, ie, they can leave script and be... or at least it feels that way which is good enough for me.We ate there just over two weeks ago hence I cant describe each dish however I can say that it was a series of dishes, tasting menu style, that had their own story with very little repetition.You will feel surprised, indulged, engaged and treated., 'W.O.W. Don read this review and spoil the fun before youe tried this place yourself. The forager tasting menu here is by far the most creative I have ever seen or tasted. Many of the plates surprised me with its textures, ingredients, tastes, and visual appearances. It almost reminiscent of Noma (or the pictures Ie seen since I haven been there yet). Taste-wise, this place easily places in my top 5 of all time. Chef Matt Lightner resume is very impressive (Le Auberge, Castagna, Mugaritz, Noma) and I wouldn be surprised if Michelin showers a few stars here. This is probably the best restaurant in NYC right now. This 17-seater (13 around the kitchen with 4 off to one side) restaurant is hidden away speak-easy style on a very uninteresting street. There is no sign for this place. You kind of just have to know the address and walk in. You can even see inside. It that hidden. The decor matches the exterior - it reminds me of a speakeasy. From the concrete countertops to the (I will assume) reclaimed wood hanging ceiling fixture to the microgardens hanging in front of the windows, this place gives off a feeling of being environmentally conscious while having a modern/industrial foundation. Food (don eat anything the day of coming here):*We started off with many small one-biters and each one was quite amusing as well as tasty: cheese and beer macaron, flaxseed cookie with coriander and pine nuts, skin of sunchoke with buttermilk, lobster with toasted meringue (lobster roll), toasted halibut with mustard seeds and horseradish parfait, pickled quail egg with malt cracker and foie gras shaped like a peanut. *Razor clam mousse and sliced razor clams inside a squid ink baguette - I loved this concept. *Lychen cracker - interesting but just a little snack *Caviar amaranth sourdough purd9e*Young almonds draped with lily flower and covered with almond parfait*Scallop with pickled green tomatoes and tomato ice - very good but I would have preferred the scallop to be a bit more chilled*Peekytoe crab with artichoke leaves in a thyme parsley etc soup*Rye bread with house made butter (cream steeped in cheese for three days)*Ramen with aromatic herbs chicken skin and topped with chicken bouillon - When I first bit into this, I couldn believe this was ramen and with each new bite, I figured out this was squid cut to look like ramen. *Morel mushroom stuffed with veal sausage and pine nut gravy*Roasted beets with arctic char roe bread topped with emulsification of sea urchin - the beets looked like rocks. *Line caught halibut withcalderon flowers garlic*Veal sweetbread with a hazelnut toffee glaze and garlic - this was the only dish I couldn finish. I took one bit and had to put this down. The sweetbread was just too chewy and reminded me of fat. *28 day aged beef with Pickled bone marrow, radishes, porcini mushrooms*Frozen white roses with wild flower sherbert - These white roses aren really roses. The sherbert had some lemon or lime flavor in it. *Poached peach with toasted something and toffee - very refreshing. *Strawberry shortcake with raw milk ice cream and strawberries - I also loved this dish as the shortcake wasn really shortcake. Delicious. *Churro with hazelnut chocolate', The most impressive and best dining experience I have had in a long time. Should have gotten 4 stars from the Times. Everything was incredible -- and they did the whole thing vegetarian for me. Outstanding. Anyone who doesn't like it, doesn't get it. Experience., 'Atera or molecular gastronomy die-hard fans are not going to like this review. Two stars for the creativity and one star for the service and the ease in reservations. Minus two stars for the food and taste. We liked the fact that we could talk, play with our Ipad and take pictures of the food (unlike at the very strict Brooklyn Fare) and no one would give a rats about it. We also liked the fact that we were served immediately when we got seated and did not have to wait for all the guests to arrive. The only downside to that is we could see what others got before us and that spoiled a bit of the surprise.Let talk about the food. I have to disagree with the other reviews that Keller and the rest of the gang need to move aside. While I did have mediocre experience at Per Se and French Laundry, I don think Atera is better than any of the other fancy restaurants. We loved the concept of the forager tasting menu, but the tastes of the food were strange and some do not taste good at all. We felt like we were hunters in a forest eating grass and anything we can find to survive. Also, somehow the dishes don seem to connect well with each other. At one point, we were craving for some meat after we ate 15 dishes of non-substantive food. We did get some dry-aged beef and veal sweetbreads near the end, but overall, we thought the menu was too one-sided.Non food-related side-note: Not sure why the restaurant was only half full when we were there. There were only 7 guests on the main area and a family of 5 at the back. A waiter informed us that there was some sort of a mix-up but 6 guests did not show up at the first seating?', interesting food, fun meal. beautiful setting and great service. i noticed a worker went into the bathroom every time a guest came out, probably to make sure it was tidy. i can't say it's the best food i've ever had because there were a lot of unconventional ingredients that i won't ever miss not eating again, but the food presentation is definitely artistic (foie gras shaped into peanuts, baked peach slice with a realistic looking pit that was made with sunflower ice cream, all the food was plated at the edge of the dishes) and creative use of ingredients. the first half of the meal was like fine dining for smurfs--small bites with lots of flowers, roots, herbs and other things, lichen (which tastes like dirt). there's elements of molecular in the preparation but not as kitschy and disney like at alinea. there's a lot of surprises in the ingredients which they don't tell you unless you ask. ramen was actually sliced squid, the strawberry shortcake was aerated batter frozen and never baked (wonderful dessert), the churro was a candied salsify root that is fried and sugared. the razor clam was served as edible shell. perhaps it was was freeze-dried, tasted like a cracker. i was happy when the protein dishes came out and were normal enough yet excellent prep. hake, bbq veal sweetbreads and mangalista pork (dry aged in-house). one downside of the dining experience is a bunch of people taking pix of every dish. green light, big white flash. sometimes triple flash. the food is definitely very pretty but aren't some people taking this whole amateur food critic thing a bit too far?, 'Brilliant !!23 course altogether for $150+ drinks/tips/tax is not bad.Let me just say if you are adventurous and like to be really out there then u are in The right place. 13 seats at the chef table is basically the whole restaurant. Once all guests arrive the magic begins. Their system & service is flawless, beautifully orchestrated. Knowledgeable servers answers every question You can think of, and let me tell you the questions poping out out your head are endless. This is not a place to satisfy the palate and the tummy but a non-stop orgasmic head trip to the next Revolution of fine dining. Down to earth organic & complex at the same time. 3 & 1/2 hours later I felt I was Reborn and left certain that it was truly the most extraordinary dining experience of my life...Atera...A+ for originality !!', I'm really torn with this review.Pros: Service was stellar. Every dish was good. The ambiance is nice and elegant.Cons: None of the dishes were outstanding. They were all forgettable.All in all, while Atera is less expensive than Chef's Table at Brooklyn Fare, I would choose to pay more BF.But I still feel confused. Because the food was good. So, put all this together and my advice is that while this isn't the best restaurant in its league, it is still quite good. It won't knock your socks off, but it will still be delicious., This place is totally incredible! Definitely one of the best meals, and probably the most entertaining, that you can get in NYC right now. The food was all super unique and delicious. Every plate was so precisely and beautifully arranged, it's almost hard to eat the food! The price is high, but honestly not that bad for this type of tasting menu. To me, it was more memorable than Brooklyn Fare, Blanca and Momofuku Ko, although very close on the quality of the food itself (except Momofuku Ko, which I'd say is a step below the others). Especially impressive and striking are all of the desserts. For pics and my comments on all the courses, check out my blog: photo-hungry.com/post/3043_.Definitely worth a visit - you won't be disappointed! Also, get the milk punch, a delicious cocktail that is very complicated to make, so I can't really explain it., 'Unbelievable!!!...Worth the price...The tasting menu was the best I have ever had. In my opinion, better then Jean Georges. Be prepared to eat.. We chose a 9:30 reservation and was there until after 12. The wait staff was perfection. I loved how even some of the chefs came around to present a course. The sommelier was delightful.. He really helped me pick a wine that went well with all the courses instead of paying extra to add on wine pairing. I also loved that they lamenated my wine label for me. FYI it took a while to get a reservation but boy was it worth it. Happy Eating and Hats off to the Chefs!', I wanted to like it... I really did. I was excited for another chef's table experience but the food was not up to par. It was whimsical dining, and entertaining to try to figure out what you were eating, and service was amazing, but if you want food you think back on and salivate, this is not the joint. I was suprised cause of the NYT review, but Chef's table was so much more amazing., 'A somewhat entertaining story:So the couple to the right of us was talking with the server a lot, and he mentioned that he used to be the bartender at Eleven Madison Park. The wife mentions that she recognized him from EMP, and my roommate and I were somewhat impressed. They must have been pretty big foodies who have eaten around a lot if they recognized the BARTENDER from EMP, right?So when the server gives the couple the beet ember course (you can see pictures at my blog if you want to), we hear the wife ask the server, Is that the beet? Without skipping a beat, the server responded with, No, mam, that the trout roe. I definitely would have laughed out loud haha, so I have to give props to that server for being really professional. We were somewhat confused as to how someone who recognized a previous bartender at EMP could mistaken trout roe for... beet.Anyway, back to the review!Food:-The service was great, and every dish was at least solid.-I have to say, though, that only a few dishes were really outstanding; the others were just solid.-A lot of the ingredients in the dishes tasted very... earthy. I guessing it has to do with the foraging aspect?Ambiance:-The server was generally great.-It was really nice to have the whole chef table format where you can easily talk to the staff and the chef. -The whole meal experience was really intimate. You could strike up a conversation pretty easily with your neighbors if you wanted to.-I have to note, however, that Chef Lightner took the time to talk to a lot of the older diners around us yet didn talk to us. I feel like the chef ought to talk to everyone instead of selectively talk to diners.Other:-Atera lets you take pictures and take notes!!! (This is pretty huge for me.)Personally, I enjoyed Atera more than Brooklyn Fare. Atera felt much more casual and friendly than Brooklyn Fare. Honestly, the ability to take pictures and notes probably had to do with my feelings regarding that. At Atera, they were more open to discussing each ingredient, while, at Brooklyn Fare, I felt like they were trying to hide some of the ingredients and oversimplify course descriptions. I kind of wish Brooklyn Fare were more like Atera.It nice to see another chef-table-style restaurant, though, and I interested in seeing what dishes Matt Lightner comes up with in the future! I also think this restaurant just going to become even more popular!Overall rating (in the realm of fine dining):8/10Note:If youe curious and want to see pictures and descriptions of each course, I have them on my blog at happynoms.com/2012/08/1743_.', Atera is an elevated and unique dining experience. My wife and I had the privilege of dining at Atera on their first evening after being awarded two Michelin stars. Atera is a tiny venue (about eighteen seats) with most of the seats around a U shaped counter overlooking the very open kitchen. This format really enhances the dinner as it is so much fun gazing into the kitchen and watching the chefs work their magic. Most of the dishes have a whimsical presentation and there is a lot of action going on in that small kitchen. My wife summed up Atera's appearance better than I could; partway into our meal she stated that it was a blend of modern meets vintage. The kitchen is elegant with slate backsplash and high end appliances yet the space itself has dark woods and large doors providing an old school vibe. Service here is off the charts; there is more staff than there are diners. Atera features a single tasting menu of approximately 23 courses (the meal costs $165); despite the enormous amount of courses our entire meal was served in two and one half hours. Prior meals I have experienced with 20 plus courses lasted in the four to five hour range; this is truly a well oiled machine. Everything was laser precise but without feeling the least bit rushed. The servers seemed passionate and enthusiastic and were extremely engaging; even the executive chef Matt Lightner delivers some of the dishes and interacts frequently with the patrons. There is a laid back vibe to Atera despite this clearly being an upscale, special experience. While my wife and I both loved our dinner, if one purely were to rank this meal based on how much we loved the taste of the food this was nowhere near one of my top meals. Don't get me wrong; the food was quite good, but there was not a single dish that left me craving more. Atera is more than the sum of it's parts, it is a culinary journey in a pleasant space with course after course of beautifully presented food served by a wonderful team; the food is so unique and interesting, full or surprises. As part of the joy of Atera is the surprise and anticipation, I will not go into too much detail about the courses, but provide just a couple of examples. One of my favorites appeared to be a razor clam; when served you are told it is a razor clam but can consume the entire specimen. It tasted quite good (and the exterior nothing like a shell); as the plate was being cleared I asked the server what it was and it turns out the shell was a baguette painted with squid ink to resemble a razor clam. Another cool dish involved a play on ramen soup - after eating part of the dish our server asked us to guess what the noodles were made of; turned out they were made of squid rather than pasta. What is cool about Atera is that rather than explaining each course in detail as it is presented there is a bit of a game with trying to figure out what you are eating. It is amazing how they are able to churn out this many complex courses in such a small kitchen at such a measured pace. Atera also has a massive wine list for such a small venue and many of the wines are reasonably priced (lots of bottles priced between $55 and $80); there are also tons of half bottles, wines by the glass, beers and a wine pairing available. The sommelier is excellent. He did not try to upsell us when we asked him to recommend a relatively inexpensive bottle (and the one he chose really matched our taste well). There also are some really fun cocktails; I enjoyed a beer cocktail at the start of the meal with rhubarb and some herb infusions; this was so good and refreshing. Tonight the meal consisted of about 23 courses; while the first several come out rapid fire and are bite sized, the remainder of the savories are large enough that we left extremely full (but not uncomfortable). There also were three different breads served at different points, my favorite being a pork bun (and there is an optional cheese course for additional cost). Atera is definitely unlike any restaurant I have dined at, but did remind me in some ways of a few of my favorite Chicago venues - El Ideas in terms of the open kitchen and elevating dining to a different level (but Atera is far more upscale and refined), Moto in terms of the playfulness of food looking like one thing, but being something completely different (but Atera has less of a science lab vibe) and Elizabeth in terms of the emphasis on fresh and exotic vegetables, herbs and mushrooms. Atera does require one to have an adventurous palate as there is a fair amount of organ meat and some game, but the food is so complex that something you might normally dislike or be afraid of may be enjoyable in this context. With Atera the meal is far more than just the taste of the food, this is really a must experience venue for foodies. Congratulations to Chef Ligthner and the Atera team on a well deserved two Michelin stars., 'I feel like all the people who like Atera are the same people who saw The Master and pretend like it was a good movie. It pretty to look at and you go in not knowing what to expect, but with high expectations. However, in the end it boring and you have no idea what the last 2.5 hours were really about. Then you try to make sense of it all, try to interpret what it all meant (because there must be a reason everyone likes it). You finally give up because you realize nothing is wrong with you, and that when it comes down to it, it just sucked.The service was awesome and the space was fun and the courses were plenty. But the food was not good. There is nothing enjoyable in eating what seems to be the contaminants of the soil in your garden. I felt like we were on candid camera and any minute someone was going to come out and say JUST KIDDING !! Don eat that dirt you silly goose.Plus a star because I left drunk on good wine, and because the Matchbox 20 they played in the bathroom provided some comic relief.', 'Atera is the newest Michelin-starred NYC restaurant, debuting with 2 stars in the 2013 guide released last week. We very much wanted to try this place, but it very small and extremely popular at the moment so we couldn get a reservation. As luck would have it, after checking Opentable every day for a week, we were able to snag a reservation for the 6:00pm seating.Atera is not a conventional restaurant. The only ever place wee been similar is d9 in Las Vegas. There no menu and everyone sits at a U-shaped counter that holds 12 people. Theye seemed to be a separate table off to the side that held about 6. The kitchen is completely open which we thought was really neat to see the chefs at work and the dishes coming to life at various stages of plating.Your only decision to make at Atera is whether you want to do the beverage pairing or not, and if not you can order a few cocktails or something from their wine list. To get the full experience, we went with the beverage pairing. Compared to d9 beverage pairing which contained a bunch of non-wine drinks (which we didn really like) Atera beverage pairing consisted of almost exclusively French wine. The lone exception was a Belgian saison beer cocktail which started off the evening while we received our snacks.The snacks were a bunch of rapid fire small plates that were only one to two bites each. Youe immediately introduced to the whimsy of the chef by receiving the well-described razor clams with edible shells and the lobster roll with a meringue bun. Everything was delicious and it was a great start.Atera gives you a lot of courses and a lot of wine and everything we had was fantastic. Theye a great deal of earthy quality to almost everything and some things are not what they seem. For example, a highlight for me was the chicken ramen soup which was presented with noodles with a flavor packet on top that dissolved when hot broth was poured over it. It was delicious (and brought me back to my college days) but the noodles wee very al dente. We were extremely surprised when we found out of noodles were actually squid!Other highlights were a smoked tomato ice with sea urchin, a smoked beet (that looked like a rock) with crustacean sauce, lamb tartare with a dark malt chip, a salad of duck hearts, and wagyu beef as the final savory course. Desserts were excellent as well and included the often photographed rose water rose, a churro which was actually some kind of root vegetable that I had never heard of, tomato (which tasted very sweet and the only clue that it was a tomato was it texture) with house-made goat milk ice cream, and a variety of chocolate truffles.Overall, we were extremely pleased by our dinner at Atera. The chef creativity was outstanding. The servers and sommelier were very friendy and the atmosphere was fun and relaxed. This kind of place certainly isn for everyone, but if youe an adventurous eater who doesn mind a few fun acts of deception with your dinner ingredients, youl really enjoy Atera.', My favorite dining experience thus far. The food - delicious, inventive, mysterious, aesthetically innovative. I loved just about everything we ate - the flavor combinations were brilliant. It was unique but did not give the impression of trying too hard. Some of the dishes may trick you and surprise you. The _____ is not an _____ at all but really created with ____. Done with artistic mastery. The food had personality. It also had an elegant and earthy presentation theme - items were served on beautiful stones and pieces of wood.The atmosphere - dim lighting, casual lounge feel. No tables/tablecloths - just a U-shaped counter and an open kitchen. Very relaxed feel, you instantly feel like a regular, watching the chefs preparing your food. They let you take photographs (which is great for bloggers, but probably annoying for others) - however when we went, there was plenty of space between us and other patrons. Got along great with the friendly and talkative staff.The mystery - the restaurant is hidden from street view and is devoid of any signage. The place is small (although they just opened a downstairs lounge area for drinks and some beginning courses) and the seating is limited. Reservations are hard to come by, especially with the new status (opened in March) and the recent Michelin 2 star rating.The deal - you get an amazing dining experience with 23 courses for about 150 plus drinks/tax/tip and that's quite a steal in NYC. Fantastic experience and some of the best tasting and most interesting creations I ever ate., We went to Atera for a friend's birthday. Based on high review and profile, we expected to have a 5 star dinner. However, miserably failed.1. Over priced. For what were served that night, didn't worth $400 per person. I wasn't sure where the all inclusive drinks and tip for $150 from other viewer, we were charged much higher than that. 2. Don't be late and have your friend starts without you or you will be ripped off. I was late due to work unexpectedly. The restaurant didn't make up about 4 courses I missed which we still have to pay for it.3. The food is only OK. With all these great reviews, we expected much tastier courses. But, I honestly don't have a memorable dish for suggestion. All I can remember is the Squid noodle was way too chewy and dishes were made with some typeof animal fat (as we were told). Just weird to hear it so many times. 4. Boring desserts. We had total 4 desserts. 3 were made with ice cream, on a snowy and cold day. But have to say, chocolate was pretty good.Overall, not worth going back, or going at all..., 'I am not a fan of fussified food that takes forever to get through - Atera is a very expensive prix fixe tasting menu with disguised food being the surprise. The fact that the ramen were really squid noodles left me with the feeling that well prepared ramen noodles would have been the better choice. I don see any point to adding Oak to an ice cream sandwich when the end result is that it tastes like sawdust. Or how about the parsley root disguised as a churro - really - fried dough would have tasted so much better! But the chef clearly has a fun time disguising food to look like something else so if you want to pay a lot of money for that - be my guest.Oh and another thing, the bartender picked up the ice cubes with his bare hands - get an ice tong!!', 'This was among the top -- if not the top -- dining experiences Ie had. There is no menu -- the restaurant reaches out to you a few days before your reservation to ask about any food allergies/dietary restrictions. There are 22 courses (several of which are small plates which the restaurant calls snacks), so you definitely leave full but not feeling gorged. It a lot of molecular gastronomy, so make sure youe into that thing (or that at least willing to give it a try). By way of comparison, if youe been to wd50, it in that style -- only better!!Some examples of the snacks: Beer foam macarons with caviar and creme fraiche, flax seed cookies, pickled quail eggs, sunchoke/Jerusalem artichoke chips, carrot leather, lichen chips (yes, made from that mossy substance -- my wife wouldn dare try, but they were delicious), salad with pastrami duck hearts, lobster roll in which the roll was a yeast meringue, a razor clam with an edible shell which looked like a clam shell, swordfish belly, oxtail broth soup with sea urchin and sweet potato, another soup in which the noodles were squid, and celeriac three ways.The mains featured some more traditional items - one of the best pieces of beef Ie ever had (Wagyu beef from a ranch in Nebraska), squab, lamb loin tartare, crudo of fluke, and sautd9ed hake.Amazing homemade breads (the pork dinner roll is amazing) and housemade butter steeped in cheese.The desserts were incredible too. Banana split had banana ice cream and candied parsnips, homemade goat milk ice cream with mint ice chips, a churro made of a fried root vegetable with a chocolate hazelnut frosting, and chocolate hazelnut truffles.The restaurant seats 14 at a slate counter that looks into the open kitchen, and has a separate table in the corner for a party of 4 or 5. The chef owner gutted the first floor office of a nondescript office building and turned it into an amazing one room kitchen/dining room. We sat at the counter, which was a lot of fun. The servers are very knowledgeable and friendly. The chef is very focused on getting the dishes out, but he came over to say hi and is a down-to-earth guy. This is not a stuffy, white glove place. Because the restaurant is so small and has received such acclaim, for a weekend reservation, you have to reserve 60 days in advance! I imagine it is slightly easier to get in on a weeknight. They have 6 pm and 930 pm seatings, with one or two 8 pm seatings on the weekends.', 'Delicious and amazing. Very small and intimate space with an open kitchen where you watch the chefs prepare the food you are going to be served. Their pickling liquid was used multiple times to pickle different items throughout the dinner and was amazing - especially noticeable when eating the quail egg (actually spherified aioli). Highlight for me was the cured swordfish belly which was one of the most amazing things Ie ever tasted. I also loved the bread that was basted in pork fat - so amazing - I know I am going to dream about this piece of bread. I think the one miss was that the restaurant tries a bit too hard to make things appear as something they are not; It worked most of the time, but sometimes the food was very very interesting but tasted just okay as with the lichen cracker and the churro which was actually dried salsify. It was a unique, delicious and great experience overall which I wouldn miss out on.', For those of you who aren't familiar with Atera, the ambitious, critically-acclaimed restaurant opened by Matthew Lightner earlier this year in Tribecca, you should probably do your homework on the unlikely success of the restaurant before you read this review of its lounge. For those of you who are already familiar with Atera, you may have recently caught wind of its proprietors' decision to open a reservation-only, underground cocktail lounge--The Lounge at Atera. While not a trend, we've seen this recipe before. The (in)famous Grant Achatz of former French Laundry fame, and the globally-lauded restaurant, Alinea, in Chicago, recently opened The Aviary--arguably the most experimental cocktail bar in the world and easily the best cocktail lounge I've ever been to.So, needless to say, I was looking forward to the opening of The Lounge at Atera two weeks ago, with very good reason.Atera by itself is a dark and elegant masterpiece of a restaurant, but we won't go there, and neither will you if you're going to the Lounge. Instead, you'll be escorted down an elevator to the restaurant's subterranean space, where the doors open to a small, beautiful, upscale room lined with original artworks, dark walls, plush leather couches and candlelight. From the minute you're seated, the service is nothing short of perfect. New York's dying but historic reputation for world-class service is alive and well at every inch of Atera, with everyone being unusually friendly, professional and personable all at once. So, don't worry about a thing there. Then there's the drink menu, which features a handful of thoughtful cocktails, exquisite wines by the glass and beer. The cocktails range from great to amazing, though one gets the impression that, with two weeks under their belt, the masters of beverage are still finding their stride, which is both natural and perfectly fine when you're just visiting the unique and splendid universe of this country's great beverage frontier.There's one other element that makes The Lounge at Atera worth visiting: peace and quiet. In New York City, they're precious. Peaceful, intoxicating and sophisticated, the Lounge at Atera is borderline perfect. I'd jump right to 5 stars if I wasn't already putting this place in a class along with the Aviary, but it's not there yet. And maybe it doesn't want to be, but I certainly hope it will be. In any case, go, and have yourself easily one of New York's more unique and sublime drinking experiences., This review is for The Lounge at Atera, the new bar/lounge under the restaurant. This is a new, reservations only, 12-seat bar (maaaybe 15) that drips sexy and swank. Lots of wood and leather, a snazzy and seasonal cocktail menu, and a cool bartender shaking and swirling away in the back. This is a great place to get intimate with a first date or impress a friend from out of town. Service was attentive from a distance, just as you'd like and expect from a place like this. Ida - you're fantastic! The space is separated well, so as long as your group is small you'll have your own space, but don't come here to have a private conversation. Oh, and in the powder room, the toilet is shaped like a square. Weird? Cool? Both., Meal: DinnerRationale: This was a special birthday/Christmas treat. I'd been wanting to eat at Atera since before they earned two Michelin stars, which is to say for the last year or two. Although I've forgotten how I heard about it.Food: Your only choice is a 15-20 course tasting menu, and the chef will accommodate dietary restrictions (we are vegetarians and, where possible, dishes were made with the meat substituted for some interesting vegetable; where impossible, he made something different and special). It was all amazing. I remember some dishes better than others, but it was mostly out of this world. I won't go into detail because I'd run out of time and space. We elected to do wine pairing, which was equally delicious, and well-done. Before we ate, we were treated to a drink in their new lounge downstairs. The drinks were inventive, and many of them also involved different types of flowers. I had a beer cocktail with vinegar, which really brightened it up.Service/Atmosphere: Atera is fancy, which I am not accustomed to. This meant there were more staff than there were people dining. There is one big U-shaped table and another off to the side. There couldn't have been more than 18-20 customers. The servers stand in the middle of the U, while the sommelier pours your wine from behind you. The kitchen is open and right next to the table. The meal lasts 2-3 hours. One of our servers seemed consistently amazed with the food he was serving us.Conclusion: I can't really do Atera any justice with my words. It is best to taste it yourself. Be sure you have $1,000 to blow, and then just go all-out with the wine pairing and any supplements you're offered. If I strike it rich anytime soon, Atera will be back at the top of my list. But, for now, it will have to remain a fond memory., 'The Lounge at Atera is a really special bar which should definitely not be simply lumped into some of the reviews for the main restaurant (which is amazing in its own right). This whopping 12-seat establishment is definitely not the kind of spot you roll up to with a large group. Reservations can be made via e-mail in advance, (even if you aren dining at the restaurant,) and are probably best for groups of two (even four is almost pushing it... that is 1/3 of the whole lounge after all). The atmosphere is dark, classy, and intimate. Definitely a great spot to take a date where you actually want to hear the conversation and enjoy their company. Not to mention, they keep the stream of people into the Lounge to a minimum--it in the basement, so the only way you are getting down there is if you have a reservation or they actually have a seat for you.We went twice in the same week, once after dinner upstairs and again after a dinner at another restaurant. Though the first trip was brief, the second was almost three hours long. We had a great time conversing with our two bartenders (we opted for the two bar seats). Not only were they hospitable, but every drink they produced was top notch, both some of the ones off the menu, as well as a few bartender choice. This was also a few days after they started serving food downstairs as well. Though some of it may seem expensive (literally $3 to $5 a bite), it is some of the exact same items they are serving as some of the earlier courses in the main restaurant upstairs. While they definitely will not fill you up, it is a great way to get to know some of the food they serve upstairs without breaking the bank.I definitely am looking forward to returning again. But given the quality, I sure it will be super popular soon enough and those seats will be next to impossible to obtain... such is life in NYC...', Atera's reputation of being indifferent to the needs of its customers is well earned. Notwithstanding its reputation, I made a reservation here and was very much looking forward to the meal -- I was taking my husband out for a special occasion. The reservationist called two days in advance and we confirmed the reservation. When we showed up for dinner, however, the host told us that the reservation had been cancelled. When I informed him that we had not cancelled the reservation but had, in fact, confirmed it, he indicated that it wasn't his problem and blamed us. Another party who arrived at the same time was told the exact same thing -- the reservation they made had been cancelled and by the same twisted logic, it wasn't the restaurant's fault. It called to mind that Seinfeld episode -- they can take the reservation, but they just can't hold the reservation.Mistakes happen -- even amateurish ones like this. But when they do, restaurants in the league Atera aspires to tend to treat the customers they've inconvenienced with some measure of hospitably. Atera's staff, by contrast, were unbelievably rude and dismissive to us, and were equally rude to another party experiencing the same problem the restaurant had created. Eat here -- or try to -- at your own risk. But I'll say this: You can spend hundreds of dollars on a meal at other restaurants with equally remarkable food where they actually care about their customers and show it, or you can try your luck at Atera, where they aren't ready for prime time and treat their customers with contempt. The choice is pretty obvious.Edited to add in response to Jodi's comment: I'm glad to hear you're fixing your system. Thank you for the apology. It's funny, though -- I wrote a personal letter to your restaurant after this experience to let you know how we were treated and to encourage you to improve the way you treat diners. I didn't receive any response -- no apology, no explanation. Writing a public review, however, gets a swift response. As I said, thank you for the apology. It's just too bad it didn't come from your host when he told us our evening plans were cancelled, or when I wrote you directly (and privately) to let you know what a crappy experience your staff created. I think I have all the information I need now to know that I won't be going back to Atera., Review of the Lounge Only: I wish more cocktail dens would take reservations on weekends. To show out-of-town visitors the nyc cocktail scene on a weekend requires blind luck (calling PDT at 3:00 approximately a million times), arrival at 5-6 pm as the doors open, a decent trek to a more remote spot like Dutch Kills or Weather Up Vanderbilt Ave. (though getting into those isn't a guarantee either), or staring down interminable lines and/or waitlists that you maybe might possibly get through before closing time. As with Milk & Honey, Atera's new downstairs Lounge is a pretty good alternative to this madness. Email them on the Monday for that upcoming week, book a time for your party, and then relax. So, the Lounge, then: it's very tiny, very exclusive, very quiet. This might be the worst pick-up bar in the city. Also if you secretly hate the party that you're going with, this joint maybe isn't such a good call because you have no choice but to talk to them and only them. But if you like your friends it's hard to imagine a more personal venue to enjoy a couple rounds. It feels a bit like a private living room except with a friendly waiter, exotic drinks and modernist cuisine snacking. Between four of us we tried most of the menu and there were zero failures. I liked the ones featuring atypical ingredients (pine sap, saffron, sassafras, etc.) The Lounge also features serious espresso equipment and what look to be strong wine offerings (I'm shamefully undereducated about wine but it's very safe to assume these guys aren't serving swill). This obviously isn't a joint to become a casual regular in, as you can't just drop by. But as far as living rooms go there's really isn't a better one., DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!! The staff and owner-Jodi are the worst at customer service. I work for an a-list celebrity. They wanted to know whether Atera carried a certain type of bourbon. The receptionist was extremely rude on the phone. I have never spoken to someone so dismissive and on a complete power trip. It took over five minutes to explain that I wanted to then talk to a general manager! Finally I got to speak to Jodi, the owner. To my surprise Jodi was even more rude than her receptionist. Talk about snobby people. She defended her receptionist's rude attitude and simply stated that it took so long to decide if she would take my call because some people aren't worth her time. Needless to say, I won't be sending my extremely generous boss to their restaurant...they just missed out on $$$$$$.Jodi------I am disgusted., 'My palate is ridiculously small. The list of things that I won eat is way bigger than what I will eat. If any protein besides beef, pork, chicken or fish is put in front of me, I tend to pass it to my always more adventurous dining partners. That being said, I prefer dives rather than tasting menu restaurants like Atera. If I feel out of place because I wearing jeans and a golf shirt, I get uncomfortable, no matter how good the food is.However, my friend wanted to take me here for my birthday and I figured WNYOLO (Why Not You Only Live Once). I glad I came because as I look at the tasting log that they hand you at the end of the meal (in expensive paper stock) I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I ate things that I would never have dreamt up in an acid trip. Fried lichen chips. Squid ink sauce. Sea urchin. Beer foam macarons. There was quite a bit of sophisticated molecular gastronomy going on here, and almost everything tasted good to great. There were 1 or 2 things that I didn care for too much, but batting a thousand out of 20 tries is an impossible thing to ask out of any restaurant.The service was impeccable. The servers are all men, and good looking men at that, so eye candy alert for the ladies. Your meal will be about three hours long, and they handhold very well. Making good small talk, eye contact, and attentiveness. These guys probably have day jobs at Bergdorf. Expect the check to be in line with Bergdorf, as a peek at the check came out to about $150 per person.One of the fun things about the place is finding it. There is no sign outside the entrance that says Atera. A kind employee will come out to get you if you have the befuddled look standing in the street.', When my boyfriend told me we were going to a tasting menu restaurant, I didn't know what to expect. I wasn't sure if I would like all the food they serve, I didn't know if I could finish everything, I just wasn't hyped about it But Atera blew me away. Their food was so good. 23 courses, as small as there were, adds up to be a lot but I was deteremined to eat everything since the food was so good! After the meal, we went downstairs to the lounge area, really neat area. Everything was great and if it weren't for the price ($650 for 2 people!), I would go back again., Came here for dinner almost a year ago prior to the NYTimes review. Jeffrey Steingarten and Sean Brock were the only other two diners at the time! Came back recently to check out the lounge. I'm a fan of any place that makes a smoky cocktails and this place is no exception. Also, the small bites for $5 a pop are totally worth it. Mini lobster roll...yummm., I usually go for uber-detailed reviews, but i'm not going to do that today. I am no stranger to top-end dining experiences, and Atera is one of the best I've ever had. We had reservations for the 9:30 seating. Upon arrival they took us down to the very cute lounge below, and we ordered some top notch cocktail. shortly thereafter we were ushered up to the main dining space, which is stylish and comfortable. One of the prettiest rooms i've been in in a while, with a soapstone wraparound counter (all the seating is at the counter except for one table in the back for larger parties) and a wall-garden overgrown with fresh herbs. The staff is knowledgable, funny, friendly and on top of its game. the food, a small plates tasting menu, is creative, delicious, whimsical, and just keeps coming, plate after plate. The theme of the menu is foraging, but things are repurposed and styled in the most delightful and surprising ways. And with the open kitchen design you get to watch the chefs meticulously preparing every tidbit.By the time we rolled out of there, 3 hours later, we were giddy and stuffed to the gills. sure you drop a pretty penny to eat here - but if you're up for a splurge, this may be about the best NYC has to offer, 'I really enjoyed Atera: theye doing some fun, creative, and exciting things with food and drink. With that in mind, here a breakdown of the top hits, as well as my extreme-foodie nitpicks. Setup. Awesome: The restaurant has great counter seating so you can watch the kitchen action. Nitpick: I wish they done a bit more of the prep work besides finishing/tweezing on the center counter, though, as even with a front-and-center seat some of the more detailed work (especially desserts) were conducted with the chefsbacks to the diners.  DrinksAwesome: I don really drink, so always ask for something interesting and non-alcoholic. Even at top restaurants this is often a bust, but Atera non-alcoholic drinks were given the same attention to detail as their alcoholic drinks - their bartender takes general requests and has fun with it. These drinks had serious flavors, worked well with the food, and were among the best Ie ever had.Nitpick: My third drink I requested something fruity *without* citrus, and got a (citrus) variation on a sour, with sassafras and egg white foam topped with nutmeg. It was also possibly my new favorite drink ever, and tasted like a citrusy play on eggnog. So the bartender is totally forgiven for ignoring my requests. :) Il be trying to replicate this one at home. FlavorsAwesome: The chef is clearly trying out lots of strong flavors and challenging flavor pairings! I love to be surprised, and there were many interesting combinations.Nitpick: The flavors weren always balanced. I often had to modify the ratios of sauce/topping to primary ingredients on the spoon to prevent the more subtle flavor from being overwhelmed/lost. This imbalance is fun if you know the processes involved, as you can effectively see the chef thought progression, but it is a less-polished final product than a restaurant like EMP or Alinea. Perfection is more opaque. FoodAwesome: There were some amazingly creative starters and desserts. My favorites were seafood, particularly the lobster roll, which had a meringue-like baked foam roll, and the peekytoe crab ravioli packed an incredibly crab-flavored punch. The desserts were all lovely, but the cracked egg ice cream was the perfect balance of flavor and fun.Nitpick:The protein mains didn stand up to the rest of the menu. The squab was a bit dry, and lamb was a bit tough - Ie made better lamb en sous vide myself at home. So disappointing, but not an uncommon problem. General/ambiance:Awesome:Fun music. Someone got good taste. Wait staff communicate across the room through hand gestures. Plates are whisked away out the back/entry door, which means they almost magically disappear. There a general air of dark-paneled mystery.Nitpick:There was a bit too much Jackson 5 near the end of dinner; sounds like the disc got put on repeat. Chef and staff had some frantic angry-looking gesticulation in the middle of dinner. Not sure what was up, but probably should have ducked out for it. The whole wee not marking our entrance because it makes us cool works, but is also a bit pretentious/annoying depending on your mood.On the whole, though, Atera is lovely, and a great experience. The things that bothered me may not even register on your radar. And it won stop me from going again next time I in NYC: the chef and crew are reaching beyond their current grasp, which suggests more fun for the future.', 'What did you say this was again? I said, having waved over one of the two amiable young men serving me (and the rest of Atera counter clientele). Toasted grain dashi, he repeated, then launched into an explanation involving kombu seaweed and CryoVacs. I loved his enthusiasm, but I wasn listening too intently: too busy downing successive spoonfuls of the clarion broth with its pleasantly burnt notes. I was enjoying it so thoroughly that it took me a while to remember that a dumpling was still floating in it. Peekytoe crab raviolo, the server had said. Almost as an afterthought, I ate it in one bite.WHOOMP. The outer wrapping, which turned out to be an ethereally thin layer of yuba, held for a moment then dematerialized, releasing its payload of pure crab essence. Such unadulterated deliciousness! So moist! How could it manage to be even juice-laden than the soup I just been slurping?!I waved my server over again.The to-and-fro of this tiny dish was a microcosm for the meal as a whole. Even when the magic was partly explained (the crab had been suspended in a lobster sabayon), the food never lost its capacity to blindside and amaze. Even the one-biters could merit a paragraph. What looked like a large piece of chicharron turned out to be flash-fried dehydrated beef tendon. Gleefully salty, yes, and delivering all the simple pleasures of a pork crackling, but also so light as to almost induce a giggle. Not to mention the uni fish sauce drizzled on top, a perfectly-judged grace note of... can I say it?... umami.But I don have space for so many paragraphs. How about synopses? Uni and sweet potato under a blizzard of Nasturtium flower petals (grown on a hydroponic farm downstairs): a gorgeous plate of oranges and yellows, pure smoothness from ground and from sea. Lobster roll where the bread was a dried yeast meringue that literally dissolved on the tongue: a New England drawing done in disappearing ink. Dry-cured Columbia River salmon with guanciale and licorice powder: salty and sweet, fish and meat. Swordfish belly coated in pork fat: aquatic bacon.I could even leave out the metaphors and just list items. Fermented leek and fluke tartare under vinegar ice. Chicken liver pate between pig blood wafers. Beer foam/sturgeon caviar macaron. Pickled rutabaga encased in beeswax. There were 19 courses I haven mentioned yet.Some offered recognizable pleasures. 2-week-aged squab had the toothiness and depth of, as the chef himself put it, Chinatown roast poultry... But none of my go-to Chinese spots ever put out a paired sauce like the quenelle of almost comically rich squab heart/liver ragu. A slice of raw diver scallop over sour cabbage and hazelnut butter hid a dollop of scallop roe but still hit with the elemental pleasure of top-flight nigiri.Others dishes deceived. Poached halibut dressed with a fishbone broth/buttermilk whey emulsion, soft and virgin white, managed to taste like nothing I ever had. Was it the chamomile oil? Does it matter? Pickled quail egg turned out to be frank, delicious fakery, an ovoid of aioli bound in milk skin. Even the butter for the breads had been steeped in Winnimere cheese. A chocolate pretzel shocked simply because... SPOILER there was no pretzel! Little tricks like that mighte been cloying in less sure hands. But chef Lightner and his crew have nothing if not sure hands. This is serious play.Take the cracked egg dessert. Maybe youe seen plays on the fake egg before (Megu raw egg comes to mind), but never executed so lovingly as here. A mannitol sugar shell around ice cream... but what was this yolk? So glistening, so decadent?It yolk, my server said. Albeit sugar-touched and sous-vided. He delivered this revelation with a hint of a smile, the same good-natured and respectful warmth that permeates the entirety of the restaurant. Everyone there seems to believe theye part of something special, and they want you to come along.You should.Probability of return within a year: 20%; I would rather come back here than Momofuku Ko or Brooklyn Fare', Please note this review is only for The Lounge at Atera.I decided to take a couple of friends to The Lounge for a couple of reasons, they take reservations and I had heard good things about the cocktails and the atmosphere. I sent an email to the reservation email address on a Tuesday requesting a Friday night reservation. I received a response back immediately stating they could take my party of four at 9 pm that Friday. We arrived about 20 minutes early and were taken down in the elevator to The Lounge right away. The place only has three seats at the bar, two tables each with two chairs and two couches that could seat another six people or so. We were given both couches, but were told others might be sat next to us (which never happened.) Even though the space is small, the seating is well arranged and ideal for an intimate chat. The server was friendly and knowledgeable, but after he delivered our first round of drinks he didn't really pay much attention to us. I think it was more a function of him wanting to just give us our space than poor service, but overall I wish he had been a bit more attentive. The cocktail list contained about eight choices all of which were very different and unique. I tried two and enjoyed them both. There wasn't a price printed on the menu, but each cocktail was $16. Have I had better cocktails for less money? Yes, but I feel that the high price is justified given the almost private lounge that you and your party get to hang out in., My experience at Atera, and the menu were very similar to the previous reviews i've read recently. The experience, food, service make this one of the unique dining experiences in NY. The space, though in a terrible location, is very cool. Maybe its changed but there were only 13 seats around the table....with another back table for 4-5., On a Friday night, there were only 8 people at the first seating.This place is not a hard reservatioin to get. Perhaps the crazy policy of having to prepay the entire cost of the meal when you reserve, with no cancellation options (though you can transfer the reservation). So i paid over $500 ($195 per person plus tax and 20% tip) and prayed nothing would happen to prevent me from going.If they don't change this, they will be out of business in less than a year. I imagine they aren't very crowded during the week.Perhaps a 3 star Michelin review or 4 star Times review could help.....and both are possible. Also, the chef wasn't even there. Thats surprising at such a intimate, personal restaurant. I can't imagine charging such high prices and not being around. I can't imagine Carlo not at Blanca or Cesar not at Brooklyn Fare.Despite that.....I can't imagine the meal being any better if Matt Lightner was there. His team was Fantastic....from the food, service (especially the Wine guy, and his great pairings)I would recommend changing the reservation policy, and getting some PR, so people know about this place. They use Molecular gastronomy, but not to the point that the Food doesnt taste great (unlike WD-50, where the food looks cool, but tastes just ok)Ko, Fare, Blanca, and Atera all rank in the upper stratosphere of NY unique dining experiences.......and all are different enough to stand out on there own. Atera doesn't have the hipness of the other 3, but they don't take themselves too seriously. The music is great, and the servers are also interactive, yet prefessional.I hope for their sake they stay at it. They should have kept prices down instead of matching the EMP and Blanca. Im not saying the food isnt worth it, but EMP earned enough Kudo's to charge it....Atera doesn't have those. Also, the pre-payment system ala Alinea/Next is crazy, since Alinea is world reknowned., 'This review is for The Lounge at Atera. I made reservations several weeks in advance and they were ready for us when we arrived. There are no markings for the restaurant from the street and there definitely a cool speakeasy feel to the place. The Lounge is one level below the street and accessible via elevator. It a little fabulous jewel box of a space with two tables for couple and two sofa lounges for slightly larger groups. It a very comfortable mod interior and the staff was very cool and friendly. The drinks were outstanding and the apps were straight from the tasting menu upstairs. Cool indie music soundtrack at the perfect volume for atmosphere. Fantastic spot for upscale hipster romance.', Lounge only review - really nice experience. Cocktails were well made: the list offered diverse liquor choices or if you proffer preferences to the bartenders they'll stir (or shake) up something special. There is a concise food menu which allows you to sample some of the great things I would eat upstairs if I could afford it. We had a burger which really was delicious and worth the $20 tag for the utter cheesiness and the foie gras mousse for the fries.Can't call this the perfect bar due to the space constraints. I don't mean the total seating of the room - that's a tiny delight of only a few other patrons and reservations are strictly honored. I mean the choice of those few chairs and tables. The leather chairs around the two-tops and the slightly larger table are a design nightmare. The bar tables come to just below knee level - it is impossible to put legs neither under nor to the side of the table (I am 5', quite small, my partner is 6'). You awkwardly knock knees with the wood and are forced to lean back leaving you over 6 feet from your drinking companion in the other chair.The only other seats are at the bar, usually my favorite place on earth. It's fine, but the bar area is rather unkempt for this type of establishment. The bussed barware sits in a bin in front of you, there is a lot of opening/closing of a black velvet curtain into a blindingly lit hallway to the bathroom/upstairs. So, yes, it was such a good time and I feel honored to have gone and enjoyed great cocktail, a way-better-than-it-needed-to-be snack, but for the price and the promise you should be able to sit properly., 'Last month, my mother brought me to Atera for a three-hour multi-course dinner. It was quite an experience, theatrical and lively, with pricey tickets purchased in advance. Service was impeccable, and the food was fun and often delicious.We came on time for a 6:00 reservation, and a young host led us downstairs to a cozy lounge. We ordered cocktails, both of which were summery and delicious. The Carrot was a bright mix of Aperol, brandy, carrot juice, carrot vinegar, and lemon; the Meyer Shrub was light and refreshing, with beer, Meyer lemon, tonka bean, and vinegar. When the time came, we were led to the main dining room. It was a small modern space, centered around a beautiful open kitchen. All twenty or so diners had great views of the work that went into each dish. And there was so much work - the plating alone must have been exhausting. Atera presentation was gorgeous and creative, with a different slate or jar or planter box for almost every bite.The meal started with a series of snacks. The first was one of the best - beer foam macarons with creme fraiche and caviar, the dainty shells crackling then melting away. Next came flaxseed cookies with coriander and pine nut butter, then rutabaga, lightly pickled and coated with beeswax. Tiny wafers of amaranth toast came stuffed with trout roe and a ramp tartar sauce - these were a briny crisp highlight. Then lobster rolls, with airy meringue and small mounds of meat that didn quite benefit from being chopped up. Beef tendon were like chewy pork rinds, cooked up with an uni fish sauce. The next two came together - soft pickled quail eggs and pigsblood wafers with chicken liver pd2td9 and huckleberry. The quail eggs were the first of many instances of trompe leil cooking - they looked exactly like quail eggs but were actually deviled egg filling shaped with liquid nitrogen then wrapped in thin skins of milk. Delicious as well as enchanting, creamy and supple enough to fool. Bone marrow followed, torched and served in edible bones made of heart of palm. The last snack was swordfish belly cured and served dripping with pork fat - fish made into lunch meat.The main part of our meal kicked off with a fresh salad of big eye tuna with fingernail-sized vegetables. Then came two of the best dishes of the night. First was a small mound of razor clam, almond, and garlic, all sliced, blanched, treated, et cetera, so that they were impossible to differentiate until tasted. The play of textures was marvelous, and the flavors subtle but lovely. Next came a similar display of sea urchin and carrots, with a few herbs and petals. The soft orange carrot was perfect with the luscious unadulterated uni. Diver scallop came next, lightly cooked then draped over sour cabbage with hazelnut butter for dipping. Then there was dried salmon with pork gel and a dusting of black licorice. A single peekytoe crab ravioli followed, floating in a toasted grain dashi. The broth was very salty but soothing, and the yuba-wrapped crab made a pleasant dumpling. At this point we got some salted rye bread with butter steeped with cheese. A sourdough roll basted with mangalesa pork fat came shortly after. The meal continued with chewy seppia noodles in roasted chicken bouillon. Green market fava beans came next, grilled in the pod, served with seaweed in a walnut consommd9. The Fourchu lobster was another highlight of our dinner, dusted with chicken and corn powder with lobster butter on the side. The cold water lobster was sweet and meaty, with a fine tender texture I never quite encountered before. The savory part of our dinner closed with roasted squab breast and rack of lamb. The squab came with a ragout of tomato, squab liver, and squab and duck hearts, as well as with roasted garlic scape; the lamb with black walnut and wheatberry.The desserts were delicious and wonderfully playful. First there was a bright bowl of juiced rhubarb with caraway yogurt and berries. Then the broken egg - this was the most innovative dessert Ie ever seen, with the exact look of a brown egg cracked to reveal boiled whites and a drooling yolk. It tasted good too, some combination of ice cream, sugar, and custard. Milk and crackers came next, two thin wafers over frozen milk and strawberries. The toasted walnut sundae wasn that tasty, but it featured a pretty cool fake walnut made out of celery root. Bourbon cask ice cream sandwiches were simple and legitimately delicious. The meal ended with chocolate pretzels and black walnuts - chocolate and caramel mignardises, presented with genius.Without the spectacle, I might give Atera four stars, as the creativity sometimes came at the cost of flavor. The overall experience, though, was a slam dunk. We oohed and aahed and had a splendid time, pampered by the excellent staff.When we went home, my mom made this video, which she is very proud of: youtube.com/watch?v=DuRD43_. Watch it and drool - that what I doing now.', Not sure how you sum up Atera in a simple Yelp review.Atera assaults the senses with creative, delicate, funny and downright delicious food. The room is so intimate with the single concrete table top wrapping around the kitchen. I suspect the menu changes pretty regularly, since the 20 tasting plates are peak seasonal foods.So don t be mistaken, you are in a 2 Michelin star restaurant. They take food, service, drinks, atmosphere seriously, but you don t have to be dressed to kill and you can feel at home with one of the most eclectic playlists of 70's and 80's rock I have heard in a long while. The place is expensive, so be ready for that.If you hate lobster, or caviar, or chocolate truffles, or ..., then I am sure there are other places for you. If not, then Atera it is!, On the menu that night:Blood Orange Fitzgerald - Gin, Simple Syrup, Blood Orange, Lemon, Angostura bittersBeer and Buttermilk Macaron with American Sturgeon Caviar and Crd2me FraicheFlax Seed Cookie - Pine Nut Butter, CorianderLobster Roll on a dry yeast meringueSunchoke Canoli with Sour Cream Powder, Strained Buttermilk, Sunchoke PureeBeef Tendon Cracklin with Egg Yolk Cured in Dill Pickle SpicePickled Quail Egg and Pigs Blood Cookie with Chicken Liver Pate and HuckleberryRock Tripe Chip with Corn Powder, Trumpet Mushroom Puree, Herb EmulsionHeart of Palm with Bone Marrow RagoutCured and Smoked Swordfish Belly with Pork Fat ReductionRazor Clam, Garlic, AlmondSea Urchin, Emerald Ice Lettuce, Pine Nut Miso, (Uni Fish Sauce, Sweet Potato Puree)Divers Scallops, Miners Lettuce, Fermented Cabbage Leaf Ice (Sake Lees, Sauerkraut)Cured Wild Salmon, Guanciale (Columbia River Salmon cured/smoked like Virginia style ham with brown sugar, allspice, cloves)Peekytoe Crab Ravioli, Toasted Grain DashiSepia, Smoked Pork Lardo, Whipped Potato (Aromas of Bergamot - sprayed on lid base)Salted Rye Bread and Butter Steeped with CheeseDried Beet Ember, Spinach, Smoked Trout Roe, Crustacean Emulsion (Sea Urchin thickened Emulsion, 12 hour sous vide beet rolled in Hay Ash)Sourdough Roll basted in Pork FatBlack Cod, Salad Bernet, Sunchoke Consommd9Roasted Squab, Burgundy Cold, Fresh Peanuts, Oxalis (Mashed, Pickled, Roasted Peanuts and Foie-Peanut)Seeded Grain RollBeef Strip, Nasturtium, Wheatberry with Toasted Bechemel, Tropaelum Majus (Morgan Ranch Wagyu, Beef Fat Demi)Pear, Mead, Almond Milk Ice Cream (Fermented Pear, Crystalized Lactose, Bergamot Sherbet, Pear Snow)Cracked Egg Ice Cream with Egg Yolk Jam (Coagulated Egg Yolk sous-vided with sugar, goat milk yogurt)White Chocolate, French Sorrel, Birch Ice Cream, Rumex Sculatus (Birch Bark)Churro, White Cardamom, Salsify, Cinnamon (House Made Nutella)Bourbon Cask Ice Cream Sandwich, Oak, Almond, VanillaHazelnut Chocolate, Black WalnutHaving visited Matthew Lightner's prior home, Castagna, only two months ago and previously seeing the space when I visited the short-lived 'Compose' nothing could have prepared me better for what I would experience when I took a seat at the counter of atera at 9:00pm, and yet what occurred over the next three hours still left me stunned - a culinary dialogue between chef and diner where unique ingredients and techniques both modernist and classic met head-on, each plate telling its own story while building in an arc about nature, time, and terroir. Featuring a highly polished staff that is happy to educate and engage as much (or as little) as the diner desires and a room that is open yet intimate it is nearly impossible to pick or choose a moment at atera that stands out from the rest but if I were forced to choose there would be three, the first a hollowed heart of palm filled with creamy bone marrow that presented two distinct tastes, textures, and temperatures at once, the second a stack of clam, almond, and garlic whose appearances and textures were nearly identical while the flavors of each came through with aplomb, and finally the aged squab; the gamiest I've had to date and brought into sharp focus by oxalis, reduced wine, and nuts - a sort of peanut butter and jelly flavor on the finish unlike anything I'd ever experienced but as good as anything I've ever tasted before or since., The best dining experience I've had in NY.But cost a pretty penny.You have to pay for food, tax and service(before ever getting served!) when you book which comes to $250 a head.What can I say? wife and I went for last anniversary - first night out after second kid was born so that also made it special.Everything about this place has been thought out to the finest details. The cocktails were amazing and unique. And then we sat downstairs where 12 people sat around a table looking into the kitchen and preparers (who were using tweezers to get the food right!).22 courses. 80s and 90s adult contemporary music (finishing off with November Rain). Not every course was a 10 but the whole experience was truly something worth considering., 'Very, very good, and very, very interesting. Beer-based macaron with caviar filling? Check. Ie only eaten at one other Michelin rated restaurant, and that was the former 3 star Robuchon in Las Vegas (it no longer ranked, but Ie heard not because it was stripped, but because Michelin no longer writes a guide for Vegas). Atera is only a two star, but in terms of technical skill I feel Atera completely blows away Robuchon, while being a better deal as well.As is normal for creative foods, you may not *love* everything, but youl be hard pressed not to recognize the creativity and artistry. There was really only one item that I thought was lacking - the heart of palm with bone marrow ragout, but the rest were pleasant or interesting surprises. Il have to post up the menu later, but there were far more tastings than I thought. At around tasting #7, I thought I had made a terrible mistake, thinking that I had overpaid and that the meal was soon coming to an end. Nope. By tasting 15, I was getting pretty full, but it keeps on going well into the 20s! Service was excellent. The restaurant is cleaned every 3 hrs or so, and it just very cool to watch the staff do their thing. Disciplined, like a fine, precision watch. After the meal, I was invited to tour the downstairs kitchen, where there is another set of staff that do prep. After nerding out over the chef copy of The Modernist Cuisine, I nerded out over the overhead heavy duty, reeled power cables, and the racks and racks of Oxo-housed ingredients. Definitely cool.', Came here for a special birthday, and the birthday boy declared it the best restaurant in NYC. It was truly a memorable meal yet one held in a non-stuffy atmosphere.At many nice restaurants, the appetizers are good and the entrees are forgettable. Here, however, I would say that the amuse-bouches/appetizers were good and the entrees were phenomenal. Highlights of the meal included the blackberries and sweet beets in clarified brown butter, the halibut (best one I've ever had) with rose petals and a dash of garlic sauce, the squab (mmm, squab...), and the cracked egg ice cream.A few dishes that left me more indifferent were the beef tendon cracklin (think glorified pork rind) and the heart of palm with bone marrow ragout. The latter actually tasted very good, but something about the combination of the high temperature and the acidity of the heart of palm made me feel during the first bite as if I had just severely burned my tongue even though I hadn't. Very strange.The music is great and the servers are extremely knowledgeable about the food and drinks. The people that work there are intense and run a tightly orchestrated show.In short, we would absolutely go back as soon as financially possible!, 'Review for Lounge:I was looking forward to this for weeks unfortunately had to cancel for another engagement but they were so nice in immediately rescheduling for the Saturday a week later. My boyfriend and I were running a little late in awful traffic and I tried to call but you can only text. After explaining our situation via text the mysterious person on the other end responded with Oh no! Sounds like you could use a drink waiting here for you when you arrive! Needless to say...it became a torrid love affair for the next few hours. Once there we dined on three rounds of cocktails and almost everything they had to offer from their edited bar menu. I am attempting to patiently wait for a special occasion to return to the Atera (upstairs) and the only reason this isnt getting 5 stars is because I just wanted to taste more things!!!', Went to this place last night for cocktails. We've been to a lot of places where the mixologists are talked about as well as the drinks they create but this place stood out from the rest. We had the Bee's Mead and the Rhubarb Pisco which was really incredible. Frothy, blush pink and perfect. I emailed for a reservation on the earlier side (just for drinks at the bar) and luckily they had availability. The bartender also made me a Swizzle with all kinds of things (clove, nutmeg). Really different and nice for Fall. I liked the ambiance and the conversation and of course the beverages!, 'Culinary art. Truly inventive dishes mixed with impeccable service. If you are a foodie then you have to put this on your ustlist. When we went - a few highlights: lamb artistically wrapped in spinach; broken egg dessert; and a wonderful hite dishthat had delicately sliced garlic and almonds beautifully arranged. Just go.', 'Wow, what an experience.We were told if we did not arrive promptly at 6, we would miss some courses despite prepaying the prefix dinner. The restaurant would also not address food allergies or client preferences. This seemed bizarre, a bit rigid and a bit off-putting before we even arrived, I was concerned about eating here. Once we arrived, it became clear why the restaurant has this policy. There are only about 14 seats with 10 seated around a horseshoe and four in the back at a private table. Going to Atera is like going to a private dinner party. There is a flow and everyone is eating about the same thing at about the same time. It would be impossible to provide the level of detail and attention if people arrived at all different times or had a host of food issues. The restaurant is not being rigid but trying to conduct a perfectly choreographed ballet. They just need to change how they communicate this information over the phone. The restaurant has no sign which adds to its air of mystery. Just walk into the apartment building labeled #77. The restaurant is just inside the building. We arrived slightly earlier than our 6 pm reservation since there was no possibility, I was missing a moment of this experience or a course at $225/person. I highly recommend the 6 pm time slot. The meal lasts about 2-3 hours and there are about 25 presentations. Each course is small but you definitely want to arrive hungry. We felt completely, satiated but not ill at the end of the meal. The experience begins downstairs in the lounge which is in the basement. It rather dark but cozy.At the reservation time, we were brought back upstairs to the restaurant which is very intimate. This is not a fancy, shmancy, pinkie out restaurant but a very cool, place with The Who and The Doors piped in over the speakers. Everyone is casually but smartly dressed. The age of the diners is also more diverse with many in their 20s. I am not going to go through the various courses since I think everyone else has pretty much covered it plus, I think it takes away some of the excitement to know exactly what you are eating prior to arrival. That said, the food is amazing. Almost everything was a hit with maybe one or two exceptions. The macron makes Laduree look amateurish. The butter with cheese is mind blowing and I do not like butter. The chef is constantly playing with your preconceived notions of food. One course was a lobster roll. The lobster is traditionally, the sweet part but not here. The lobster meat is served on a meringue roll so the lobster becomes the savory. My recommendation is to try everything and get out of your comfort zone. I do not like fish that isn shell fish but I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed many of the fish dishes including the caviar on the macron. The presentation is outstanding. Each course has a unique set of dishes and silverware when silverware is used. There are many courses where your fingers are used. It makes the food very accessible even when the food seems unusual.The service is outstanding. The guest to employee ratio is about 1:1. The kitchen is an open kitchen and probably the quietest and cleanest one that I have ever seen. I couldn figure out where the dirty dishes went and only learned that there is another kitchen downstairs from reading the other reviews. The plates are whisked away from one side and presented from the front. At no time, do you ever see anyone cleaning a dirty plate or even hear clanking. The meal was a ton of fun and delicious. We really enjoyed it. It is not inexpensive but to me, it is no different than going to dinner and the theater. Thank you for a wonderful evening.', Ok soooo amazing!!!! There is really a 1:1 ratio if dinners and staff. A person next to me sneezed and they even gave her a new tissue incase they needed it. The staff all seem happy and super friendly. This place is not stuffy, and has super fun music light rock!! Ok now to the food. It was soo good! I was so impressed that each small bite had huge amazing flavor! You can tell that they put lots of thought and fun into the menu. Even the bread and butter have fun flavor. I really recommend for three of 1,000 reasons: 1. The service is the best I ever had in any restaurant. 2. The food is amazing and worry every penny. 3. The place is fun and not stuffy and makes it fun night. You should totally go you won't be disappointed., 'The most meh Ie felt after a tasting menu. Extremely creative, no doubt, but many of the flavor combinations fell far short of expectations. Like my girlfriend said, she felt more inspired by their tweezering than cooking.', It was our 4th anniversary and we decided to go big. Started off the night in the lounge beneath atera, before our 9.30pm res. The drinks were on-point. I had some sort of bourbon concoction and it was terrific. The main event: 18 courses. Wine Pairings. This is one of the best meals I've had in my entire life. It was long, but not boring. I wish I could write more, but I was pretty buzzed and full by the end. The one dish I remember was the deep fried beef tendon that was coated in an uni glaze. Best meat i've ever had in my life. Go!, 'Coming here with and unsuspecting date gives you instant baller and man of mystery status. They take you down to the elegant, yet unassuming lounge for a pre-dinner drink. They bring you up to your seats one couple at a time to an intimate kitchen / dining room where the ash wood ceiling beams, slate counters and backsplash, and plush greens set the mood. The service here is pretty impeccable. There are easily as many staff in the kitchen and serving as there are diners. Your plates and utensils are switched promptly after each course, and there is an individually set, leisurely pace. For those of you not looking for all the specifics of the meal, just skip to the end now. Toasted grain broth with duck hearts and seaweed - coming in on a cold night, this warmed you right up. The duck hearts were tasty, but the seaweed I didn love. Beet coated in bee wax - interesting mix of texture and flavor. Not bad. Monkfish liver - is was awesome. Super rich with a crunchy apple and thin bread. Smoked trout with pork fat - interesting play here. He fish melted in your mouth, and this had a very bacon-y flavor, and this was like eating pork fat. Very cool. Amaranth toast with smoked salmon roe - nice. Little fish, little smokey and crunchy. Razor clam with garlic and almonds - this probably took 20 minutes to create. Looking at the dish, you can tell the difference between the almond, garlic, or clams. It a masterpiece to behold, and tasty to boot. Dumpling with picked truffle - reminiscent of Greek lemon soup, good dumpling, but a waste of a truffle by picking it if you ask me. Geoduck - very tender rendition of a sometimes tough clam. Scallops - cooked scallop, topped with scallop mousse and scallop broth. Lots of scallop flavor here. Smoked lobster with onion compote - not bad, but not my favorite. I felt like they could have done better with an ingredient like lobster tail. Lobster roll - the bread melts in your mouth. This is a cool dish for sure. Sepia with tarragon wheatberries - looks like pasta, but you aren cutting through this. Interesting different flavors and textures, but didn love is. Pig blood flatbread with bone marrow - super rich and decedent. I really enjoyed this. Hush puppy with smoked egg yolk - eh... The egg yolk added a creamy richness that made the dish more interesting, but still not overly memorable. Smoked oyster with rice porridge - great flavors and texture. Well executed dish. Consume with foie gras and garlic seeds - as good as a soup gets. The richness of the foie gras melted in perfectly in the broth, and the garlic seeds were somewhere in the middle of roasted garlic, raw garlic, and pine nuts. Roasted duck - you get maybe, 1.5 ounces of duck, which is a shame because it was good. The duck jus was awesome. Duck chip - filled with a meat mush of heart, kidney, and liver. I loved it. Sorbet - great presentation and refreshing mix of 4 different citrus sorbets. Cheesecake and cheese ice cream - this dish is pure genius and my favorite of the night. I literally laughed when I took a bite. The block of cheese was cheese cake, and the ice cream was cheese. Goat milk yogurt with marshmallow and brown butter chips - the yogurt was rich and delicious, and the brown butter cannot be described. You know when people use the phrase depth of flavor? The brown butter chip is what they are talking about. Sweet potato donut - not bad, but just a donut. This would have benefited from a filling. Pretzel and chocolate walnut - neither what you expect, and both good. Two main issues with this meal 1) there was no significant protein. At Momofuku Ko and Chef Table at Brooklyn Fare, you get some sizable pieces of meat or fish. Not here. 2) about 1/3 of the meal is smoked. If you aren a fan of smoked flavors, you will not enjoy 1/3 of this meal. It a lot of the same flavor profile across dishes. While I did really enjoy the meal here and the service, the lack of a main, significant protein, especially considering the $195 per person price tag, left me feeling like I paid for the hype and some innovative techniques, and not the meal. It a great meal, but it not Momofuku Ko or Chef Table.', 'Absolutely incredible experience - from the pacing to the staff - cocktails, wine list and the menu were all incredible. A 5 star experience from beginning to end!!!', 'Atera made it to the three michelin star group this year, and also won the best tasting menu.. but I not impressed.Atera is like that new kid on the block that is trying a little too hard to be hip and in when in reality it just makes the place feel a little too hipster for me.The restaurant was kind of difficult to find as it was located inside a doctors office type building? It kind of seemed like it was trying to be a secret place. When you enter you get taken up the elevator to this dim waiting room/bar area where it was set up in a way with just a few couches that it seemed like a place to go mingle with other couples or people. Mind you all the other couples waiting around kept to themselves just like us. It made me feel a little uncomfortable being kept in this tiny little room with all these people i didn know.. and I was super relieved to be fetched by someone to take us up to another floor for dinner.Upon entering the actual dining room, i realized the layout was pretty cool with the kitchen being the main focal point of the room and the seats in the house are circling the kitchen in a bar stool type manner. Cool yes, but also uncomfortable to be sitting on these stools for 3+ hours.As far as the food goes, the tasting menu was a major let down for me now that Ie tried both Per Se and Eleven Madison Park tastings. How did this win best tasting??? Yes, the selection is unique and different with quite a selection of unusual picks like monkfish liver, pigs blood crackers, duck heart ragu, and purple beets dipped in beeswax... but none of these items were in anyway palatable to me. Out of the box, maybe but I don see how these items justify a $300 price tag. Now if you were looking for a place to impress a date, and you had $600+ to blow on you and your partner.. this might be an interesting place to take them. The place felt exclusive, like you had to be in the know how to be there. But if you want a delicious hearty meal, I wouldn come here. Especially if you happen to be a picky eater.', '2014 Michelin 2 starsLocated in an unassuming building in tribeca with no exterior sign, this Michelin 2 starred speakeasy is located on 77 Worth street on the Left hand side as soon as you walk in. The lounge which is open to the public is one elevator level down. This is where you can have pre/post dinner drinks just in case the 3 hour dinner wasnt enough time for you to get your eats on. They typically only have 6pm and 930pm seatings, but we were able to score a 7 pm seating on a weekday, and they do stagger the plates that come out, but fear not everything was prepared fresh as you could clearly see in front of you in the open kitchen. The service was good, on par with other 2 star restaurants but not up to par with some 3 starred places Ive been to. The food I would say was on the high end 2 star/low end 3 star places. Everything was good, some more memorable then others. The price point at over $200/person with no drinks, tax, or service charge included is on par of 3 star places. The dishes were meticulously put together with close attention to detail. All of the portions were SMALL, not one course would you say was an entree, instead they had endless tiny portions of their plates to entice you make you wonder what the next will be. Am I a fan of this? I would probably prefer to have it where the portions were bigger, and the course number was less (this tasting was close to 20, lost count at some point during the night). This is a pretty small space as well with less then 20 seats in the restaurant. The lounge downstairs is also small as well which makes it a little be more intimate. All in all I did enjoy myself, but at this price point would rather go back to Per Se or EMP.'|2
10|aziza-san-francisco|Amazing organic Moroccan food and great atmosphere. This is perfect for dates. One of my favorite places in the city. (There's belly dancing, too), 'nice dining environment, great moraccan food, belly dancer on weekends', 'I had one of my best first dates ever here. Go for the tasting platter. Many items that you can eat with your fingers. Ask to be seated in one of the velvet booths. Need I say more?', 'Hey....gotta check out this restaurant...very good small dishes as well as good dessert!!! i recommend the lamb or the chicken wrapped in phyllo dough.... bon apetite', 'Easily the best Moroccan restaurant in the city, plus some very enticing belly dancing. The five course tasting menu is a tempting option, very reasonable too. They have a really fun and inventive cocktail menu as well.', Wow! The decor is romantic and elegant, with inlaid exotic wood tables, and chic light fixtures. The staff is knowledgable about the food and the wine list, and they go out of their way to find out what kind of flavors you enjoy before making individual recommendations. The food at Aziza goes way beyond your typical Middle Eastern eatery. Even standbys such as couscous and tagine are updated with bright flavors and organic produce. We can't wait to go back., 'Amazing! I love their Moroccan room. Love their food. Their staff is so friendly. I love this place! Oh yeah and the belly dancing every hour...yup. Needless to say, my guy friends love this place not just by the food but also the atmosphere.', Really like the food there, organic Morraccan food and great ambience! Cocktail was on the strong side, but ask the waiter to recommend appetizer, there's this one with great portion to be shared by 2-4, can't miss it (sorry i forget the name of it!!!!) Entree portion is on the small side., 'Amazing food, great ambience, hot bellydancers! Try the lamb shank , its perfection.', 'A Middle Eastern jewel in the Outer Richmond. Good and plentiful food and drink. The belly dancer is fun as well, especially when she starts dancing with a sword on her head. (How do they balance that thing?)', My journey through Morocco was one of the best vacations I've ever had for a number of reasons, not the least of which was the incredible cuisine at rock-bottom prices. A meal here costs considerably more, but the menu offers fairly healthy and light contemporary interpretations of traditional dishes. Disappointingly, the seating is confined to chairs and banquettes rather than cushions on the floor, but the atmosphere is romantic and the food is exquisite. Try the basteeya, a baked phyllo pie with a filling of saffron braised chicken (replacing the traditional pigeon) and spiced almonds, covered with a layer of powdered sugar and cinnamon, a course designed to be shared by two, as outstanding as any I sampled in Morocco. Recommended entrees include spiced prawn tagine, stewed lamb with charred eggplant, couscous Aziza (a melange of crisp vegetables, grilled chicken and prawns, spicy lamb sausage, and stewed lamb), and braised lamb shank with a honey-kumquat glaze. For vegetarians, there's a soup of organic lentils in a lemon-infused tomato broth, steamed saffron-scented couscous with crisp vegetables, raisins, toasted almonds, and chickpeas, and a berber tagine of root vegetables in saffron-ginger broth on a bed of couscous. The grilled herbed flatbread is a must. Groups might consider the chef's five-course tasting menu ($39 per person), which is served family-style and requires the participation of the entire table. Besides the seating, the only other concession to American expectations is a belly dancer, a form of entertainment never found in any of the native restaurants in which I dined., 'I am a food snob and this is hand down my favorite restaurant in SF. Reasonably priced, consistently excellent food and fun drinks & desserts. Kind of far away but worth it. Try the tasting menu for 39 bucks, its so much food and is absolutely incredible.', Loved the dark, sexy dining room (sit in one of the back rooms for a quieter experience), and the menu was so huge it was difficult to choose. This might be one of those places where it's better to do a few appetizers than one app, one entree. Portions are big, prices are fair. My dessert, a goat fromage blanc with crushed pistachios with slightly curried Frog Hollow peaches, was THE BEST dessert I've ever had. Ever. The wine list was a bit small (maybe 20 wines?), but well-chosen for the cuisine. Try the Bloody Mary - it's phenomenal. The only bummer is the location. There are no cabs to hail, and when we had them call us one, we still waited about 30 minutes. A yukky ending to a fabulous night., 'great first date restaurant! i had a very romantic evening here over the weekend with a guy i met recently.... i had no idea if we would hit it off or if i would like moroccan food, but i was happy to discover both were a hit. first, the atmosphere is like an aphrodisiac... its intimate and visually fun with these huge candles, belly dancers and beautiful colors everywhere. my date and i tried the scallops and ahi tuna with a nice bottle of wine. it was such a lovely night and everything complimented each other so well i left there feeling almost in a daze of giddiness. i highly recommend this place for dates.', 'The food was amazing, the parking was easy, and the atmosphere very romantic. Lots of vegetarian options. I was sad not to see belly dancing, though. Maybe I was there on the wrong night.', The appeal of Aziza is in the lighting and ambience. Let's face it:--in that dimly lit room of draped oranges and purples, even Steve Buscemi can look attractive. Go for the tasting menu for a reasonable $39/per person and have a long leisurely 5-course feast, that with the right company, will be a well spent 3 hours. End with a desert sampler that will render you speechless momentarily., 'Terrific experience.The restaurant is set up to indulge you.The food is very Moroccan, forget this greek style mentioned.The food is great and on the not so busy night we were there we got to meet the delightful pastry chef. Leave room for dessert if you go, her pastries are to die for.', A fabulous date spot! Innovative drinks and impecable service. The atmosphere and decor makes a very original dining experience. It's also a great place for vegetarians!, There's not much that beats Moroccan done right, which this place definitely does! The drink list is amazing (personally I loved the lemon basil drop...but trust me, there's something for everyone), the service was great, atmosphere is perfecto, and the food....OHHHH the food! Started with the wild mushroom in phyllo and seared scallops served atop a wonderful corn/pine nut/ cucumbery fresh salad...both were excellent. For main course we shared the couscous Aziza and lamb with eggplant...of the two I would say the couscous was my favorite, but both were done just right and had wonderful flavor. For dessert...pumpkin tart, couldn't quite pass it up! Perfect date place, perfect for a night out with the girls...just perfect! YUUUUUUUUUUUUUMMMM!!!, 'UTTERLY FANTASTIC creative moroccan inspired food. you can tell the menu is authentic with a genius twist.space: great colors, warm and inviting. simplicity at its best. food: the combination of flavors in every dish is inexplicable; the chef blends the sweet, sour and spicy to perfection. succulent lamb brochettes and shanks, moist cous cous, wonderfully spiced veggies. also, you must try the harissa sauce.drinks: unique. cilantro and lime kafir. pomegranate and champagne. delightful.crowd: mostly older, more sophisticated. we were by far the youngest and most boistrous table, but after you have your first bite, all but your plate will cease to exist.', My girlfriend (see below) took me here. Mmmmm, good! Food=good, cocktails=good, service=fancy... There's nothing bad to say about this place! It's just good, good, good! Go there, you'll love it!, 'Yummy good stuff, nice flavor combos, blended just right - not too sharp, not dull. The COCKTAILS are really worth going for - semi sweet cucumber ginger, celery vanilla, honey lavendar... on and on...', 'Food is always delicious - and everyone loves going here! I pretty much take all my out-of-town guests here, and one even exclaimed, I not religious or anything, but this food seems last Supper worthy. I regularly drive way out of my way to delight in this amazing organic Morroccan fare - and the waitstaff are incredibly hospitable and welcoming. Definitely recommend!', 'i thought i knew about food till i went here. coming from an asian american background, growing up in sf, i was exposed to the usuals and can disect most cuisine down and make a grown chef cry. tried the prix fixe. the flat bread and spread. oh my. the simple corn soup OH MY FREAKING LORD. so far i was amazed, but being the arrogant food snob, when this filo dough stuffed some chicken topped with POWDERED SUGAR AND CINNAMON, i was all, wtf??!?!?! powdered sugar and cinnamon? wth is that? one bite. OH MY LORD. it went like this the whole meal and at the end, THE BEST ICE CREAM ive ever had. toasted almond icecream. i love how they have three rooms, each with a distinct feel. i prefer the first room, the first booth on the right. very private and cozy. easily recommend as a foodie and can also easily recommend to a friend for a night out. thank god for aziza, well maybe allah. this place ROCKS.', 'Couscous is one of my favorite dish. Traditionally the couscous is served in a seperate plate, and has just been prepared in water and butter, giving it this not dumpy, golden look. If you were to eat it just like that you would need a large glass of water. In another seperate dish is served the vegetables that needs to be cooked over a few hours to get the proper taste. The vegetables are served in a dish with the juice which you can use to mix with the couscous and harissa. And the meat is cooked seperately. The juice can be used also to go with the vegetables to give it more flavor. The couscous dishes served at Aziza forget some basic cooking steps to give the couscous itself, and especially the vegetables their real flavor. I love couscous so much, and have had so many in Paris in traditional algerian or maroccan restaurants, that I was quite disappointed and actually sad not to be able to get that original flavor, which needs quite some expertise in the preparation. Aziza cooks some average couscous dishes like people can do at home within an hour. The vegetables don have that rich traditional couscous dish flavor, and it too bad. I haven found a restaurant in the city that was able to deliver that original flavor. Aziza doesn deliver in terms of taste, and is so pricey for the quality of cooking you get. 2 stars for the effort on organic ingredients.', 'I went here last night and was very impressed with the decor and wine list. The plush boothes are ideal for getting close to your date during these sometimes chilly winter months. In SF do we consider them winter? I don know. Either way Aziza is a great location for a cozy date and they do 5 course tastings which Ie always been a big fan of. Not to pricey either.', 'Truly delicious food and great atmosphere. My first experience here was on an anniversary date. We ordered the 4 course tasting menu, which turned out to be a bit much for just two of us. The food was incredible, and the service was attentive and friendly. Our waiter knew the menu well and was ready with suggestions for wine pairing. The second time we stopped by on a whim without reservations and were told that they were booked. To our surprise, we were stopped a few doors down by the hostess who had actually chased after us to let us know that she could fit us in. Had a great dining experience then and subsequent times. Unique and interesting cocktails are a must-try.', I went to Aziza last night on a hot date with my husband. The decor is nice, low lights, blue walls and booth seating. I don't like lamb nor mushrooms so I was stuck ordering seafood b/c I had no other choice but to starve. Their cocktails are amazing, so if you go there and are not a lamb eater, stock up on those cocktails and their great starters. It is a little too pricey, and the food presentation was done on very large plates which was a bit cheesey.Regardless, it was OK but would not crave to head back anytime soon., 'A wonderful restaurant to visit when you want extraordinary food in a warm, intimate setting. While you could go with a group, I go in a pair. Bring someone you want to cuddle up next to in one of their roomy booths. Order the spreads- aged balsamic eggplant mousse, roasted pepper & pomegranate, yogurt-dill served with grilled flat bread- to start. (A good chance to feed each other, if youe into that sort of thing) Corkage at Aziza is a reasonable $15, so we brought our own wine (UNTI Syrah 2002). They opened it for us shortly after we arrived, with no problem. Along with the spreads, we also ordered the prather ranch kefta skewers to start. The cucumber & torpedo onion salad with a black sesame vinaigrette that the skewers came on top of was amazing. The skewers themselves were also great. For our entrees, we ordered the couscous aziza and the moroccan spiced prawn tagine. Both excellent. The rose water that is poured on your hands before you are given the dessert menus is a very nice touch. Even my date seemed to enjoy it. Desserts were well-executed, we tried the Candy Store and the Ode to France. The slow roasted cinnamon stick ice cream that came with the Ode to France was amazing! I have never eaten anything like it. The Candy Store brought many little tastes including, sea salt caramel, pistachio-apricot baklava, earl grey tea & sesame cookies, rose meringue, star anise truffle, peppermint patty and pomegranate gele. We took a cab to the restaurant, and I am glad we did. When we got the check we asked for them to call us a return cab. By the time we signed the bill, it had arrived. Transportation couldn have been smoother. Unless you have a designated driver who doesn mind circling for parking, I advise you to cab it. My only complaint? After several visits to Aziza, the pacing still seems a bit off. On my first vsit I waited nearly an hour between first and second courses. A recent visit, however, saw major improvements to the pacing, thankfully. All in all though, a romantic date night at Aziza leaves little to be desired. UPDATE 7/8/2006: I wish the watermelon cocktail had been refreshing like our server touted it to be. Heavy-handed and slightly too sweet is a more apt description. I preferred my friend morocco mary. The spreads were tasty as usual - you can go wrong starting your meal with them! My seared day boat scallops were good, but not even comparable to the utter deliciousness of my friend devils gulch ranch rabbit with hungarian paprika, baby carrots, parsnip puree, dried bing cherries - the flavors in this dish were nothing short of amazing! The lavender-black pepper angel food cake with strawberries in mulled wine and creme chantilly sounded a lot better than it was. The cake was tough. Tough angel food cake?! You heard right, and it was every bit as disappointing as it sounds! Also, no rosewater on this visit. I missed that little touch.', went for DAT 1/06 just thought it was ok. Expensive!! Oh you get a fork and knife, and linen napkin. No belly dancing which is great. Free matchbox here. Bathroom: only 1 women's room for all the guest-ridiculous. I like El Mansour better-cheap plus u get belly dancers (kinda annoying). I want to try Tangine in the Tenderloin for cheap Moroccan., 'Simply awesome. From the romantic ambiance to the diverse flavors of food. Definitely the right place for a date. The prix fixe tasting menu has a nice variety of dishes and will more than satisfy you. The price is very reasonable for the portions and quality of food and service you get here. This restaurant has shot up to one of my San Francisco favorites.', 'Perfect date restaurant. The lighting is low, and everything is soft and a lush deep red. Little secluded booths along the walls are very romantic and good for cuddling. The food is delicious, the chef really cares about his food, and you can tell. I love the lamb shank and had lots of other food here I can remember right now. Get a watermelon-cayenne cocktail, or the celery-vanilla, or some of their other ingenious cocktails. They also have a few Belgian ales in the bottle including an Affligem Tripel. Make sure to end with at least the Breakfast at Aziza, which is a brioche sandwiching cinnamon apples (looks like an english muffin) with dulce de leche ice cream on the side, looking amazingly like a poached egg. sooooo gooooood.....', Great food, really cozy ambiance...the waitstaff needs training. Let's see, my dinner companion and I ordered the ruby RED grapefruit/avocado salad and nobody warned us that they were using WHITE grapefruit. I would not have ordered the salad had I known. We pointed it out and it was just shrugged off. I had the lamb shank w/couscous and it was very flavorful and such a huge portion. My friend liked her chicken and couscous as well. The chocolate cake was yummy with chocolate sauce and creme inglase (on top). The service needs work but the atmosphere and the food make Aziza a place I will return to in the future., 'Pluses: Interesting food - often excellent, good service and a romantic atmosphere. Reasonably priced for the value. Minuses: None. We (party of two) ate there on 02/13/2006. I was happy as soon as the water appeared at the table -- it was oh-so-slightly perfumed with orange. We started off with a Fez Fizz (proseco and pomegranate puree) and had the grilled spicy lamb sausages with a goat yogurt and fromage blanc dip that had enough personality to stand up to the lamb sausage but did not compete with savory punch of the sausage. We shared the basteeya and I thought it was beautifully flavored but just a teensy bit dry. I have no experience with that dish, however, so that may be the way in which it is normally served. (Update: Ie been informed that basteeya is normally not overly moist. Since the dish includes four servings, we each had a wonderful leftover for breakfast) We also shared the Moroccan spiced prawn tagine which was delightfully fragrant but not overly spicy. To end we had a spiced cake (I can remember the name) that was also delicious and shared an Arak (a Lebanese anisette). The Arak is definitely an acquired taste and I will probably finish my next meal there with a Port or Brandy.', 'Great ambience, amazing cocktails and tasty foods. Get teh tasting menus.', This place is extremely delicious. Everything you put in your mouth explodes with flavor.I went here with 4 others on my brithday last friday night. We had a reservation but the place didn't seem overwhelmingly crowded.Lots of time between courses to digest (you certainly do not feel rushed) and drink orders seem to take a while longer than necessary to arrive.Even with the ample time between courses, the tasting menu is a LOT of food! My party didn't eat anything all day, and we were still unable to finish all the food on our plates. Each person gets their choice of soup, we had 5 appetizers (chef's choice) to share, a giant basteeya, we each got to select our own entree, and then we each had a choice of desert. We took the leftovers with us to a bar afterwards and handed it over to some homeless people. Too delicious to waste.Best couscous I have ever had. EVER! Seriously, everything we ate was amazing. If you're going here on a date, the food will inspire enough conversation to fill the long periods between courses, don't worry.I highly highly highly recommend this restaurant., 'Nothing ruins a decent meal more than a 45 minute wait in between dishes...We ordered the tasting menu, which is a fantastic deal for the price. flatbread and the baked basteeya were definite highlights of the meal; great authentic flavors. But then 30 minutes went by with no checkin from the server; not even a water pour. Finally, he comes around and coldly says, your entree will be ready in a few minutes. Then another 15 minutes go by when finally the main entrees come out. No apologies, no explanation. I can even remember what we were waiting for, but all I do remember is that it was salty, overcooked, and unnecessarily steaming hot. Though the meal started out well, hard to recover from such a mid-meal disaster.', Lovely Moroccan Decor.... but more California cuisine then Moroccan.... when we were there they didn't even have a Moroccan or Arabic tea?#$%^.... but it's cute.......and the staff is nice and attentive....wallah....., I hardly ever leave the 94123 during a school night, but when I ventured the 4 miles or so to Aziza for a date I was wonderfully rewarded. It's super dim in here, but made my first date seem intimate in a good way. We tried several scrumptious dishes that were fortunately okay to be a little messy with. And don't even get me started on the cocktail list - phenomenal. Unfortunately I wasn't as smitten with the guy as I was with the menu, but that's life. Trial and error with love and food!, 'We went here last night, I was so excited to try a new spot. Saw the reviews on yelp looked at the menu before we decided to try it out, as we entered pure joy, lighting was dark, the smell in the restaurant was heaven, no one greeted us at the door, their was not a hostess or podium in site, we saw a few tables open so we sat down.. After about 5 min a server approaches, Can I help you with something? Hmmmm, I was just wondering if we could order some drinks, he tells me, usually the hostess seats the guests...I am thinking OK....The the hostess comes over, What can I help you with? I am thinking is this really happening to me? I repeat myself again, ummm I was just wondering if we can order drinks, she tell me we need to go to the bar area..We pass by the bar and decided to leave after the bartender seemed to busy to acknowledge our existence. Perfect way to ruin my night, I was born in SF and I had tried sooooo many restaurants, and have never been treated this way...after getting over the anger now I am kinda sad this type of service still exists when there are so many options in SF, what a waste of my Saturday night.', 'Whats all the hype around this place about ? Have people really lowered their bar of excellence. Among the many places in sf that one can choose from, in the spirit of competitveness, one would expect better overall service. Based on the various reviews that this place recieved, we decided to give this place a shot. We walked in and noticed that there was really nobody there to seat us at that very moment. So we took it upon ourself, to be seated. It had been almost 10 mins, we noticed the waiters/waitresses walking by our table, refusing to acknowledge our exsistance. We finally, requested service and were told that we had to be seated by that lady by the front door. Hmmm.... odd, but the lady at the front door happened to just mysteriouly appear from the back room. Anyways, overlooking all that had happened we still decided to have a few drinks there, but were then told that the drinks had to be ordered at the bar, and that it was all self-service. We walked up to the bar, and it took the bartender a good 3 mins to even acknowledge our presence, oddly enough he was engulfed with meaningless conversation with one of his lady clients. That just did it for us, and we decided to spend our saturday evening at a place other than Aziza. I am normally generous with that star rating system, but had to give this place only a 2 star, due to the lack of not having a star and a half.', Aziza has become one of my favorite restaurants in The City. Start with some of their amazingly creative cocktails (the combinations might sound strange to you at first but trust me, these folks make flavor into art). Then definitely do the tasting menu. You'll get to try a few different appetizers and choose your own entree. It's a great amount of food, a great value, amazing flavor and the recipe for an all-around perfect evening.They even have valet parking so you don't have to circle the Richmond District looking for someplace to leave your car.Go here! You'll love it., The restaurant definitely has got the date atmosphere-- dimmed lighting, a very sexy exotic feel, the rose water scent. The food is very rich, so if you are on a date don't over order! Feeling stuffed is not a sexy feeling. My favorites are the chicken kebab with couscous, flat bread with Mediterranean spread and every dessert on the menu. The desserts here are some of the best and most unique desserts I've ever had. So save room for dessert!!!, 'Very tasty, inventive drink selection, and great atmosphere. My boyfriend is from Morocco and he thinks pretty highly of this place. The bastilla is extra yummy if you ask for it more on the moist side.', 'Between 5 of us, we ordered several of the small plates/ appetizers (recommended: mediterranean spreads, sausages, keftas, spinach & feta fingers), basteeya, and 3 entrees to share, instead of each getting their own entree. Almost every thing we ordered was fantastic. The guinea hen entree was a bit too salty for a couple of us, but the rest of the group seemed not to mind. The vegetable tagine was quite bland.Our server was very attentive and her recommendations were all very good.They have some unusual cocktails on the menu... be sure to try the cilantro kaffir lime-ade and ginger & pear.', Incredible food, a bar serving creative and delicious cocktails, great ambiance. I didn't think there was a cocktail I hadn't tried but Aziza has a whole menu of inventive, delicious highballs. Very romantic, after dinner here my date had me home and in the sack in no time. OK it was my wife, but still that's not a slam-dunk., Beautiful restaurant, beautiful food. Just can't wait for this chef to put out a cookbook. Every time I visit here, I can't live without the Moroccan Mint Tea or the Vegetable Tagine, but I have yet to have a disappointing item. The Basteeya is excellent here - just the right mix of sweet/savory.I haven't seen any belly dancing (referenced in other reviews) in the 5 or 6 times I've been here, but the food does the talking. No more entertainment necessary!, On all of these Yelpers recommendations I took my wife there for a date and we were not disappointed. Cool decor, great ambience, excellent food, good vibe, romantic, good service - the food was quite tasty. We were surprised that a place like this existed in the Richmond, something you'd expect in the Mission. Thank you, Yelp!, 'i think i came too late for the dancing ladies but.... aziza has an amazing menu, and by amazing i mean not run of the mill. i mean fresh. exciting. mmmmm and oooooh, i want to try that too kind of menu. my boyfriend wished it was winter time as the palace-like atmosphere and hearty food would hit the spot on a blustery night. the wait staff was friendly and patient. the drink menu was organized by type of booze, and my blood orange, mint, cranberry vodka was muddled and tasty. the seats are perfect for the nap youl want to take afterwards, and the high ceilings allow for music and conversation at a pleasant level. note on dessert: if you order the in the raw expect it to be just that. it was so quirky we loved it - two unpeeled tangerines, a handful of spicy almonds and 5 dates. plus they have cute little mother of pearl frames that they leave at your table to remind them not to forget your doggie bag. ++++ for being able to make a reservation for 10:30 on a sunday night!', It truly doesn't get any better than this. Our company got the backroom all to ourselves, and boy did we dine like kings. The chef is an inspiring man. He gave us a short talk on the difficulties of going organic and making ends meet- everything that can possibly be organic (and local) is, by the way. I recommend everything. And if you get the wonderful, bald, blue-eyed waiter, in his 30s, you're in luck- he knows wine like the back of his hand. This is the place where Morocco meets California, and they live happily ever after., I don't know what is happening to this farm-boy jock who used to so proudly proclaim his total mook-dom to all and sundry in loud, boisterous drunken clarion calls.I am now a fan of a variety of foods I could never cook on my own given infinite time and infinite monkeys at work in infinite kitchens.Anyone who is new to Moroccan cuisine owes it to themselves to do the tasting menu here. But bring a hockey bag to cart away the leftovers, because if I can't finish em, neither can you, wee man., 'Having a favorite in any category just feels wrong. To some, it connotes a closed-mindedness that is inherent in people who like to place things into categories rather than on a continuum. Well, then call me closed-minded because I pretty sure that Aziza is slap happy hands down darn tootinmy favorite restaurant in SF. I can honestly say that Ie tried almost every appetizer, entree, and dessert on the menu and have never felt anything to be lacking. The food is heavily flavored (so for those whose tastes lean towards the bland side, you best head to the IKEA cafeteria) and meat-oriented, save for one lone couscous dish. On top of this, the belly dancer that makes her appearance on Saturdays is actually attractive. And while some may argue that the minaret cut-outs of the walls separating the dining booths lend a Disneyland-like air to the restaurant, I don mind them at all. Because I LIKE Disneyland. Or at least I did when I was 7.', I LOVE this place. A bit far out but soooooo tasty. Their mediterranean spread sampler is to die for and be sure not to miss the basteeya. This place has great atmosphere and excellent food. It's on Geary in a very blah neighborhood but step through the curtains and you feel like you're in a cool Moroccan hideaway. I would highly recomend it.UPDATE: Just went back last night and yummy as ever! I had the rabbit this time and it was sooooooo good. The service was a real standout too, they forgot to bring us one of our appetizers so it showed up with our dinner which we totally didn't care about but the guy gave us a free dessert anyway. Really nice touch. I can't wait to go back and write another update!, My husband and I went here with some friends. I loved the ambience, and I loved the flavors of the food. However, we all agreed that for the price, the portions were small. Part of the problem is that most of the people in the group wanted the traditional Moroccan food that comes on huge plates to be shared. This is not that type of place. The flavors of all of the items we ordered were extremely well balanced, and very good, but this should be thought of as the Moroccan version of nouvelle cuisine. The wine list definitely could use some work. Next time I will try the tasting menu as was previously suggested.Update 1/29/2007My husband and I went last night with a friend for ostensibly drinks and appetizers. I want to go back and describe the ambience. The dining room is painted in a teal blue that is not a flat color but more a variation in depth and tone all over the walls. The booths are framed by the Islamic curve supported by graceful columns, and so this overhang is painted with a terracotta orange. The candles are in tall crushed amber mosaic glass lanterns on tables and in the corners of the booths. There is a chandelier with red bell shaped glasses giving off an exotic ambience in the evening. On the walls are framed black and white photos of Arabian horses. The tables are all polished glossy decorative wooden inlay rounds. Even though it doesn't scream Moroccan, there are subtle touches.The drink menu is one of the most creative I have ever seen. (I've not yet tried some other hot spots yet) My husband had a kiwi, and ruby grapefruit in tequila with the rim slated with fleur de sel like a margarita. Outstanding. I had the vodka with cilantro and hangar one kaffir lime. It was also excellent.We started with a bunch of appetizers and ordered one main dish to share as another appetizer. The spreads app was so delicious, each one different than the others, although I'd be pressed to tell you exactly what they were.We also had the kefta and grapes with cucmber slaw. Also wonderful.The lima beans came as a side in a small dish with tomato and onion sauce and topped with what seemed to be cotijo cheese, or maybe a type of feta. Good but the beans were not cooked enough.The salad of grapefruit and avocado is something I love to make myself. Our friend got the soup which he let us try and it had to be the best carrot soup I have ever had. The carrots were roasted and there was orange and grapefruit juice added, and a creme fraiche on top. Luscious.......The main dish we ordered was lamb chops with a sauce that was caramelized tahini, I think. My only gripe is I wish it were less expensive. The plates are very small portions., What is it with me and Moroccan Food for my birthday? Ok, so on my 32nd Birthday my sister and I went to Aziza. The decor is effective and provokes a relaxed mood. Each room has a different feel, but all are whimsically and modern. Not like slick modern, but well done. This restaurant is very hip, like the Standard Hotel in L.A. (read: lots of beautiful young people) The drinks are imaginative and very good. I was impressed with the bar choices. The food is very delicious I got the impression that the chef is not Moroccan (I could be wrong) but a chef that has carefully studied Moroccan food and has re tooled the recipes to reflect san Francisco's tastes. The belly dancer was great and there was not a forced feeling to get up and dance with her such as other Moroccan restaurants. We were able to watch her craft, or just eat which is refreshing. The food was smallish plates and the flavors were extremely well balanced and savory. It is a bit of a jolt leaving this lovely ambiance and walking onto busy, smoggy Geary Blvd., If your pocket book is feeling heavy go crazy and try the chef's tasting....you won't be disappointed, but you will definitely be stuffed and content., No doubt, my favorite restaurant in San Fran despite ranking Sushi and Persian food as my favorite cuisines.The devil is in the details and everything (And I do mean everything) is so well thought out.Great tasting food often times are those dishes that combine flavors and ingredients that sometimes you wouln't necessarily combine creating entirely new taste sensations...For me, Aziza's is a classic example of creating original and unique taste sensations...All of which, in my opinion, are exceptional.The 5 course chef dinner for $42 is a treat but you better not sign off on that unless you are beyond famished...It's A LOT of food.The desserts are terrific...The homemade sorbet is sublime and the rhubarb tart with creme fraiche is a gastronomic delight.We had leftovers and they even have a cute way to remind you of your 'doggy bag'.Very warm, inviting and beautiful decor and staff. It's true, it's a great date place but I've also gone with my extended family and is perfect for family style eating.I agree that the wine list could use a spark...Moreover, I think having a few other wine selections by the glass as it is a bit limited.It ain't cheap but I really recommend treating yourself at least once to food at this level, Faaaaaabulous. Go there when you absolutely need to feel fabulous and, um, have the money to support it. You'll need the extra cash to finance your cross-country cab trip to get there.Feel like a stah and order the 5 course meal. The cocktails are amazing, but avoid the lavender one. It smells like lavender, and well, tastes like soap. In all fairness, my mouth was REALLY clean., i LOOOVED this place! i haven't had good moroccan/mediterranean food but aziza knocked my socks off!!! if going for the first time i would definitely recommend getting the tasting menu for $42/person (requires the participation of the entire table). it lets you try a variety of their wonderful dishes with good size portions. everything tasted fresh and original and presentation was fab! as yo bean mentioned, it's very romantic and you would NEVER know looking at the exterior. my kumquat cocktail (thyme, mandarin blossom vodka) was light and refreshing...kinda want one right now. our 5 course consisted of the following: -lentil soup: YUM....best that i've had! -bodega goat cheese w/spiced cherry tomato & citrus jam: spread it on the zaatar croutons and you'll be in love at first bite! -mediterranean spread of balsamic-eggplant mousse, roasted pepper-pomegranate-walnut, and yogurt-dill served w/ flat bread: i enjoyed all the spreads and such wonderful presentation. -giant lima beans: i'm not a fan of lima beans but wow, they made it so delich by baking it in a ras el hanout tomato puree, feta and oregano. LOVED IT! -basteeya: good but was already getting stuffed so only took a few bites. -lamb shank: unfortunately i didn't like this one too much. it tasted too gamey for me and flavor was nothing spectacular. -seared scallops: good but little on the salty side -black cod claypot: very light and tender...cooked perfectly! -mint ice cream sandwich: the mint ice cream was a bit overpowering for me -bittersweet chocolate tart: this was DIVINE..LOOOVED IT! still dreamin about it.... -frog hollow cherries:simply cherries, dates, and spiced almonds. TOTALLY recommended and would DEFINITELY go back!!!, Aziza is the BEST place for excellent Moroccan cuisine! The ingredients are fresh and organic. The flavors are intense with just the right amount of spices. I enjoyed every dish that we ordered: chilled pea soup, beet salad (I'm a beet salad snob and Aziza does it right!), mediterranean spreads (balsamic-eggplant, pomegranate/walnut and yogurt dill mousses served with warm flat bread), ranch kefta skewers (delicious beef balls and grilled grapes served on a stick - this is a must-order!) and the prawn tangine. I even liked my passion fruit iced tea. I will definitely come back!!!|1
11|benu-san-francisco|'Benu is very much a unique dining experience. Ie never tried anything quite like it. From the upfront & immaculate kitchen to the custom-made, hand-painted ceramics to the informative wait staff, Benu was strong in the finishing details. While Ie never been to The French Laundry, this is what I imagine to be something of a departure, and chef Corey Lee does not disappoint.I had the fortune of partaking in the tasting menu, and Il include the highlights below. I won get too descriptive, however, as you really should experience it for yourself.Shark fin soup - This is in quotations due to the fact it is synthetically made. For more information on this process, watch Corey Lee @Google talk: youtube.com/watch?v=O3Aq43_.The dungeness crab & black truffle custard were nice touches and complemented the soup well. My favorite dish of the evening.Other notables:* Abalone grenobloise - Deep fried abalone. Need I say more?* Sea urchin in potato puree * Lobster Curry * Pear sorbet* Riesling - Not officially from the tasting menu, but part of the wine pairings. I enjoyed it so much, I asked our server to write down the name (on embossed Benu stationary, no less).I oftentimes felt surprised by what I was tasting (ie. sesame chocolates?), but every dish was paced & portioned well, not to mention thoroughly enjoyable. By the end of the meal, I left excited to return and to try the a la carte items that weren on the tasting menu (ie. risotto, lamb, scallops).Now for the granular:Tasting menu is $160 per person, and the entire table must participate.A la carte items range from $20-$40, I believe.Menus can be found here: insidescoopsf.sfgate.com43_Verdict: Highly, highly recommend!', 'Me: All I need to know is if it worth the hype.Him: Hell yeahHim: foie gras with cherry glass torchonHim: crab butter and black truffleHim: uni potato mousseline topped with herb finesMe: soldMe: Youe been to the soft launches - you have pull.

Every dish better than the prior; as in, oh, this one the best one yet. Wait, no, *this* one is the best one yet. As I read in an interview with Cory Lee, technique should be in the service of the food, not as a technique for technique sake. There must be plenty of technique in putting together all the food, but it *is* the food that shines. I would primarily describe the tastes as delicate; mostly, they were combinations of subtle flavors, nothing in your face, with unusual presentations of sometimes obscure ingredients. I had two favorites: one was the monkfish liver (a constructed thing, not as you might think of a sushi item. In a similar vein, when I was at Pierre Gagnaire, for their cheese course, they had blue cheese, but it was much more than that. Blue cheese was an ingredient, but it was so much more; similarly, monkfish liver here is so much more than just monkfish liver). The other was the uni sabayon on mashed potatoes. Sublime!The big difference I feel here, vs, e.g. Masa/Dining Room/French Laundry is that the exploration of ingredients seems much more far ranging and more avant garde. But on the other hand, it all done in a way that the presentations seem quite classic.I was not disappointed, and once I save up some more money, will be back!', 'It been just about one year and six months to the day since I first tried Corey Lee excellence at The French Laundry. To be honest I had no idea what to expect out of Benu. It been hiped up over the past year and I had been eagerly awaiting it. Although I had read in an interview that Corey wanted a restaurant that you could just pop into, I still had built up in my head that it was going to be his French Laundry. How can one not draw similarities between the two, the chef that opened Per Se and headed the french laundry for a number of years, including the year it won the best restaurant in the world by San Pelligrino. I had very high expectations going into the dinner and it delivered on most of my expectations.Food: I opted to build my own menu off the a la Carte. We each ordered the; Monkfish Liver Torchon, Veal Sweetbread grenobloise, Snapping Turtle veloute, Sea Urchin Risotto, Japanese Giant fin Squid, beef rib steak Bone Marrow.Monkfish Liver Torchon. This dish seemed to me, the foie gras of the sea. I had a preparation of foie exactly like this one last year at FL, and there came my first link between the two, very sublte, but there. The Brioche could have been a touch larger, and perhaps not as thick, but the composition was spot on. Torchon was extremely smooth, savory, and crisp, working with the apple relish to give a nice sweet flavor. All together a great dish, but not a ow.Snapping turtle veloutd9, langoustine, vegetable matignon. Since I decided against the tasting menu and ordered about 7 A la Carte items I opted into this magnificent dish. Love the way it is served, in a bowl with a lid that has turtle shell print on it. The langoustine was a delicate and generous portion sitting on the vegetables with the veloute poured around it. This soup for lack of better words was a broth of reduced pork,chicken, and turtle bones with a hint of flour added for consistency, and then showered with snapping turtle meat. This was a sublime dish, that was very rich, and magnificent. The turtle broth was a great sweet yet savory element against the Langoustine. If you are not ordering the Tasting menu I HIGHLY recommend getting this dish, extremely worth it. Definite wow dish. Carnaroli risotto, sea urchin, corn, lovage, black truffle. The main reason why I did not order the tasting menu. I am not a fan of risotto. I normally shy away from it at most restaurants, even very very good restaurants. However, this dish sounded too fantastic for me to pass. When the dish was presented it had a very lovely fragrant truffle aroma, ascetically pleasing with the sea urchin, and tasted heavenly. The risotto was littered, and I mean littered with truffle bits. Absolutely perfectly cooked risotto contrasting with the melt in your mouth sea urchin really pulled everything together. My personal favorite dish of the night. The Sea Urchin risotto could easily become Benu Oyster and Pearls. Service: We ate on Benu second day open, and for a new staff on their second day they did a great job. Everyone was extremely nice and very professional. Ambiance: As I said earlier, I was totally expecting something different. Benu is a very relaxed contemporary restaurant that is meant to invoke a sweet disposition. The muted color, bench seating, and open ceilings make it almost seem a very big family room. Other than the very loud and rather annoying foreign table next to us the Ambiance was a laid back and very enjoyable atmosphere. This is not a french fine dining restaurant, it is something completely different, like a breath of fresh air. Benu was a great experience. Corey Lee is a very stand up guy. You will not see any Gordon Ramsay drama filled yelling happening in this establishment. It is a humble and technically perfect purpose built restaurant that is meant to invoke expression in food. Great Job Corey!', I love the minimalist approach to the decor. I would have give this place five stars if it wasn't for the extremely small portions for the amount you pay for each dish. The presentation of the dishes were amazing. My favorite was the amuse bouche which was this gelatinous tomato concoction in a shiso broth?I got: lobster bouillon soup (light and perfect), veal sweetbread appetizer (YUM but a little greasy), squid ink entree (OK)My fiance got: snapping turtle soup (hearty and delicious), truffle potato (luke warm and nothing special), pork belly (tasted like something hanging from a Chinese restaurant)I loved the chocolates at the end of the meal.All in all, I would compare this restaurant to the new Morimoto Napa restaurant that just opened. I would define Corey's food as refreshing. Nevertheless, I prefer Morimoto for the creativity, taste, and value of his food., I had braced myself prior to going this dinner so I would focus on the experience and not the price. Thankfully, experience - it - was! You see, my friend recently purchased a place in One Hawthorne and would always comment how late Corey Lee could be seen in his kitchen prior to Benu opening. ...Yeah, he was there at 11PM last night! ...he was there until...! And when his email came through that he had two tables of four opening night, I knew I couldn't say no. Thank you so much for the invite! Having two tables was perfect. One table did the tasting menu the other opted for d3 la carte (which was paced with our friends tasting menu). We arrived at 9PM and chatted with some of the staff prior to being seated. During this time I think I officially freaked out the Administrative Manager by knowing too much about her...but it WAS all on her bio from the Benu website. Yes, people like me read those. Our courses are listed below: 9PM 1. Lavash 2. Tomato, cucumber, dashi, summer blossoms ~11PM -Waiting while the other three guests at my table enjoyed their first course 3. Risotto with corn, black truffle, sea urchin- $22 4. Scallops with amazing bacon - $22 5. Beef rib cap, Bluefoot mushrooms, pine needle honey - $32 6. Strawberries, Strawberry sorbet, buckwheat shortbread, Douglas fir meringue - $12 7. Chocolates 1AM Food was a total experience! My favorites were the scallops and strawberry dessert. Courses are very small on the d3 la carte menu. Wine list is great and offers wines at a reasonable price point too. Overall the service was decent with a few slip ups. My biggest gripe of the evening was our server's attitude. There was a lack of communication regarding course delivery in the beginning (which caused our whole table to wait), my still water replaced with sparkling later in the evening (and the server retorting that she poured still - definitely not necessary) and our dessert being delivered to the wrong seats. That said I'm sure she was under a lot of pressure being opening night. Most memorable part of the evening was going into the kitchen and talking with Chef Corey Lee. Yes, there were photos taken and even menu's signed. :-) Very cool evening and a very cool Chef!, 'Benu, the rebirth of Chef Corey Lee as he spreads his wings...After waiting nearly 4 wks, I finally made my way to Thomas Keller protd9gd9, Corey Lee new restaurant, Benu. As an fyi, I made reservations the day it became available on 7.18.10 and was only able to snag a reservation for Thurs, 8.12.10 at 8:45 PM. Benu is tucked away on Hawthorne St, across from Gold Club and at the corner of Roe. As you walk towards the entrance, two large pane windows give you a glimpse of Corey Lee and his entourage in action. As I entered the gates, I was pleasantly surprised to find a courtyard which for a slight moment made me forget about the hustle and bustle of SF.As I walked up the stairs to Benu and through the large wooden door, it felt like I walked into someone living room/dining room. It sleek, modern, and intimate w/ a minimalist approach to dd9cor; crisp ivory walls and carpets, dark black tables and plush bone suede chairs. Dim lighting and smooth jazz sets the tone for an intimate dinner.MENU:Option to dine a la carte or a15-course tasting menu ($160/person and full participation by entire party). Do note: the menu online is NOT the same one Benu offers. Portion size is VERY small, so it was recommended that we got an app, soup, pasta, a seafood entrd9e and a meat entrd9e, which will set you back about $100/person w/o drinks.Due to some of our dietary restrictions and food allergies, we opted for the a la carte menu, and shared apps and got our own entrd9e.FOOD:*Complimentary Nori Buckwheat Lavash: MEH! My friend summed it up when he said, It taste like burnt bread w/ a nutty kick. *Complimentary Tomato w/ Dashi Broth: GENIUS! As I took a spoonful, the savory and sweet broth hit my palette and as I bit the tomato balloon, it EXPLODES into my mouth and I was hit w/ a burst of tang. *Eggplant Soup ($12): MINDBLOWING! The soup was silky smooth, rich, and perfectly seasoned. The crisp and savory parmesan croquettes added a nice texture contrast while the tomato added a mild tang. *Potato Confit ($14): OK! Although the app had bold flavors from the savoryness and saltiness of the chevril and the richness of the truffle oil, the potatoes were undercooked and raw in the middle which undermined the taste of the app.*Smoked Salmon a la minute ($14): GOOD! The salmon was rich, buttery w/ a hint of smokiness. The tangy horseradish helped balance the richness of the salmon. However, the pumpernickel bread was sliced so thick that the texture/flavor of the salmon and its accoutrements got lost in the bread. *Monkfish Liver Torchon ($16): OMG! Like foie gras of the sea; delicate and smooth lobster-like flavor w/ a consistency of a velvety custard. A top the toasted brioche and sprinkled w/ the apple-relish, it was the perfect combo of crunch, richness, sweetness, and tang. *Veal Sweetbreads Grenobloise ($16): YUMMY! Lightly fried in panko, the sweetbreads was crisp, tender and rich and w/ a taste/texture most similar to liver. The pickled celery added a great crunch and citrus flavor to balance the richness. *Carnaroli Risotto w/ Sea Urchin ($22): DISSAPOINTING! Although the sea urchin was velvety smooth, rich, and sweet; the risotto was undercooked and hard in the center. *Rigatoni w/ Oxtail & Wood Ear ($18): YUMMY! The perfectly al-dente pasta intermingled w/ a red wine butter sauce that was bursting w/ BOLD flavors; salty, savory, mushroomy, and beefy goodness. The oxtail chucks were rich and tender and the wood ear added a delicate crunch.*Beef Rib Cap w/ Bluefoot Mushrooms ($32): YUMMY! The beef cap (strip along the center cut of a steak) was cooked to a perfect medium rare. The cap was tender, juicy, and the heavy marbling added a hearty beefy taste and richness. The mushrooms were delicately soft and had a very mild flavor. Dabs of the mizuna and honey concoction added a layer of mild pepperyness and sweetness. *Soft Chocolate Ganache ($14): SINFUL! The ganache was decadently rich and hit my palette like smooth satin. It was layered w/ phyllo dough which added a buttery crunch while the banana ice cream added a creamy sweetness.*Financier, Almond Milk, Raspberry Gelee & Peach Sorbet ($12): Refreshing and sweetly satisfying. The financier (cake) was light, buttery, and nutty which played off the sweet almond milk which was smooth and jello-like. The raspberry and peach sorbet added a vibrant sweet and tartness. SERVICE:Welcoming, friendly, and attentive, but w/ a slight pretentiousness. Do note: Benu is not a place for a quickie dinner, we arrived at 8:43 PM and didn leave until midnight. Kudos to Chef Corey Lee for his progressive approach to American cuisine. He takes high quality ingredients and pairs them w/ other components that unseemingly work well together. Not only will his dishes give you a new take on flavor and texture combos, it will definitely tickle all your senses.', My wife and I somehow scored reservations for Friday night. We were quite excited to try the place and expectations were high. I can't really fathom the pressure Corey Lee must have been feeling. Our expectations were exceeded and we had a fabulous meal. Overall, we were pretty blown away. The flavors were interesting, varied, and crisp. Each dish gave us something new and delicious. Perhaps we had a few quibbles here and there, but no dish disappointed and we felt the quality/value ratio was quite high (we did a la carte--3 dishes each plus a shared dessert). We would definitely go back (though perhaps next time for a special occasion and not just on a whim).  The long report:Before we get to the food, a shout out to the service. Pierson, our captain, was wonderful and answered our myriad questions. Michael, the sommelier, also answered all our questions and spent a good deal of time talking to us, which was nice given we were just ordering a few glasses of wine and nothing too fancy. The rest of the service team was great as well--just enough attention and the right amount of description of the food. You knew what you were eating but didn't have to sit through a lecture for each course. We opted to go for the a la carte menu as there were a few items that struck our fancy and the tasting menu seemed like a ton of food. Pierson told us that the portions were small and the menu set up so that each person could order an appetizer, a pasta, a fish and a meat. We decided to each order three dishes instead of four and that turned out to be the perfect amount of food.The amuse was a dashi broth with a tomato water sphere (the only bit of molecular stuff I saw in the meal) and some tomatoes and cucumbers. It was a really refreshing taste, almost like essence of gazpacho. For the first course, my wife ordered (we shared everything) the lobster bouillon which had a bd9arnaise custard, some tarragon, some veggies and a few pieces of perfectly cooked lobster. A spectacular dish. The most lobster-y broth I have ever had and the custard was a great way to make the dish more substantial but not heavy. I ordered the sweetbreads. These were perfectly cooked with a delicious lemon caper butter sauce with some cauliflower florets. We love sweetbreads and these did not disappoint.For the second course, my wife ordered the risotto with black truffles and sea urchin. This was delicious and rich. There was some corn in the risotto which was gave a nice hint of sweetness. My only issue was that the truffles overpowered the uni a bit, but I therefore just had to enjoy the uni on its own. I ordered the sablefish. The plating of this dish was remarkable. It looked like a miniature forest thanks to the beach mushrooms. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sake broth was delicious.For the third course, my wife had the lamb, which was 2 lamb chops (1 bone) that were marinated for a day (according to Corey) in citrus, apple and some other stuff and then pan sautd9ed. They were extraordinary--perfectly cooked, great lamb flavor. It came with nice slices of garlic sausage and some perfect potatoes as well as some succulents--who knew those were edible and tasty. I ordered the beef rib cap. The chef swore this was not done sous vide, but I am not sure how they got these pieces of steak to be perfectly medium rare all the way to the edge with just a millimeter of perfect char. The bluefoot mushrooms on the side were great. My only issue was the beef sausage it was served with was sort of tasteless, or at least overwhelmed by the rest of the dish.For dessert, we shared the blackberries. I can't describe this well, but it involved berries, some cream, Douglas fir meringue (which was delicious and the second time pine was used as an ingredient), some cream and a crumble made with buckwheat and candy cap mushrooms. I was quite surprised with this dessert in that many times desserts at a place like this go over the edge of creativity and just aren't satisfying. This was both creative and delicious. And importantly for us, not too sweet. A nice way to end. (besides the chocolates which were also delicious)., 'To me, Benu is definitely a work in progress and has room for further refinement of flavors. the presentation is already remarkable -- see photosHearing Corey Lee speak gives you a lot of insight into his restaurantyoutube.com/watch?v=O3Aq43_He is a very talented, motivated chef dedicated to perfecting his craft. Certainly he has the same potential and opportunity like other ground breakers, i.e. David Changfor an opening week, things went very smoothly. service was very good. i liked the unique silverware and flatware, and the minimalist design worked. i like non stuffy high end dining--no jackets requiredI viewed his tasting menu as fine dining incorporating asian ingredients. naturally, he does a progression over 14 courses. there were a few show stoppers and some mehevery dish was impeccably presented. many ingredients were finely diced, perfectly plated.my favorites were:*faux shark fin soup -- the black truffle custard really made the dish...having the small recessed portion and mixing the rich broth with the textural element of hydrocolloid to match shark fin really worked -- this will be the signature dish of the current tasting menu*also loved the beef rib cap -- meat was perfectly prepared, soft (musta been sous vide), flavorful, and even though the sausage was not super moist, the coalescing flavors made you want more*i was impressed with the ankimo torchon and apple relish mustard, which really had a nice bold flavor (could use a thinner brioche bread however)*the playful eel cigar was a nice touch with a clean eel flavor though the avocado did not come through much*one of the understated hits of the menu is the dessert -- strawberry sorbet, buckwheat shortbread, vanilla sounds mundane, yet it an explosion of flavor concentration and a happy medley of textures (was reminded of a little fruit roll-up, plus the concentrated fruits, cold sorbet, with little bits of shortbread--love those elements)*the veal sweetbreads were executed perfectly, great breadingthings i wasn impressed with were the haiga porridge (lemon, chewy abalone cubes didn work), but it was nice to see him pushing the envelope and incorporating porridge, peasant food in a grand tasting menu -- who does that, hehe?the uni potato puree didn have a good ratio of uni to potato, thus potato overwhelmed it -- corn was great thoughthe pork belly dish sounded great, meat salty with sugar on the side but only liked the cherry olive part of iti think the anchovy gelee was good but a little too many elements, particularly the lily bulbs, which were overwhelminga few of the beginning dishes started off slowly (clean, light, flowery -- meh), palate cleansers etc, meal brought full circle with the mirroring of palate cleanser right before dessert...less mint in that last one though please.the dashi broth starter did have a bit of molecular gastronomy with the tomato explosion (spherification)chocolates were nice -- esp. the salted onethe restaurant kitchen is beautiful and draws you to peek in.at the tasting menu price point, i still think it a worthy meal, but I can see his menu evolving so that every dish will be a hit(like a meal at Bo Innovation Hong Kong)oh and if youe a big eater, you probably will still be hungry even after 14 courses.(the wine pairing was quite interesting -- how often do you see a beer pairing? that was progressive)', Had Saturday night dinner there, food was good (wasn't blown out of the water), the bottles of wine we had were all spot on. The room is a nice setting, if a little austere...the disjointed dining rooms cause it to be a little too quiet. Service was everything it should be...they could stand to tone down the hoity toity a bit. The server was a little too heavy handed with how great the restaurant is, etc. etc. Overall the experience was good but still make the value judgement against the check., 'Corey Lee is amazing. Ie never been to French Laundry, never even heard of the guy (i not a foodie!), but I was totally blown away by the entire dining experience. 14 courses is not an easy menu to plan. Since others before me have written novels detailing each dish, I will just write about the most memorable ones:*dashi: do not pop it in the bowl like I did on accident. put in your mouth to get the full effect. very refreshing and light*veal: it came out at the perfect temperature, with a very nice layer of crispiness.*eel, fueille de brick: very interesting presentation, looked like a hard churro. the flavors were unbelievable with the creme fraiche.*shark fin soup with black truffle custard: I thought the dish was quite salty, but purposefully so. this is by far one of my favorites*beef rib cap: this was course 12. i was pretty much in a food coma by course 9, but this woke me up. cooked to a perfect medium rare, tender, flavorful, rustic feel.*strawberry sorbet: i could have eaten a whole bowl of the buckwheat shortbreadand to end the night, coffee from LA Mill. i NEVER drink coffee past 2pm, but I was falling asleep. plus, swank places like this always have good coffee. Benu is no exception. I will offer mixed reviews on the wine pairing. As a predominantly red wine drinker, I didn know what to expect with so many whites. The reds are not very memorable to me, even the Bordeaux 2005 blend was just okay. Pairing the sea urchin with sake was a very different combination, but I think it worked. I would recommend the pairing for those who do not know much about wine (and have $110 to spend) as I do trust the sommeliers, although I was not a fan of the Madeira. If I could do it again, I would have just ordered two half bottles, one white and one red. But this is a personal preference.Service: I would have given Benu 5 stars had their service been a little bit better. We were seated in a corner against a very awkward wall (which was fine, but still awkward). The servers were all very kind, but did not bother to check in with us that often. They only came around to deliver the dishes and take away the plates in an almost robotic fashion (I sure they are feeling the pressure of a new restaurant opening). BUT, we couldn help but notice that the table next to us was getting a lot more attention from the servers. They were clearly people with money to throw around; they had been to Bouchon two times last weekend (yes, I was eavesdropping), so clearly people who eat well. Anyway, I digress. We would have preferred some more attentiveness compared to the other diners. The meal lasted over 4 hours, and we didn leave until 12:30am. It was well worth it though, we ended the night meeting Chef Corey! Thanks for the experience.', 'Summer 2010Asian inspired fine diningIt was no Tetsuya, but it was good14 courses, but really it was like 8 courses because they did a lot of them in tandem (cheating imo)Lots of only above average so here the ones that stood out:pork belly, tomato balloon in the dashi consumme, truffle jello in soup, jook with abalone', 'I tried the a la carte menu:1. Monk Fish Liver Tourchon - nicely done. usually this type of liver is a bit too much but the Chef kept it light.2. Risotto with Uni and Truffle. - adding three of my favorite ingredients together was genius. Well done.3. Beef cap (slice of beef) and the Chef used the extras to make a sausage. tasty.4. Peach Sorbet with Milk Tea, Shiso and Raspberry glaze(?) I think the Chef tried to combine traditional or the best of Chinese/Japanese food with a French flavor. To call it fusion is kind of an insult to his creations but at the same time, this was no French Laundry. Improvements: The waiters need to remember their dishes better when presenting. There were a lot of ummms when describing my dishes. Otherwise, it a fairly new place so I sure itl get better with time. The atmosphere was a bit stark and cool. Love the garden before entering the restaurant. Would love to go back and try his tasting menu for $160. Lots of great ideas....(ie: shark fin soup, ox tail, etc.)', 'good, but overpriced at $160 for the tasting menu. i love the chinese influence on the menu. i hate how it felt like i was eating everything with tweasers. i don like how the decor was unfurnished apartment. service is okay, just a few minor missteps.ranking wise, i put it about tied with coi, and quite a bit better than quince. Compared to the the 2 and 3 star michelin-meals ie had in tokyo, kyoto, paris, la, vegas, nyc (about 15, half in japan), i say it ranks right in the middle, maybe a little below.il probably try the ala carte menu at some point (we had the tasting this time), but not until ie returned to manresa for ala carte at least a couple more times, and tried both saison and commis.', I fail to be a foodie in most regards since my palette isn't refined enough to enjoy things like foie gras or uni, but that doesn't dissuade me from enjoying fine dining.food was incredible.there were tons of flavor layers in each dish that even a peon like me could enjoy. we had: delicious sesame crackers.amuse-bouche tomato encapsulated thing. EGGPLANT SOUP WAS INSANE. spaghettini - great flavor very interesting end note. oxtail rigatoni - tastes like the wilderness. woody/nutty/earthy flavor. sea scallops - nice light flavorbeef rib cap - If I had to describe the sausage that comes w/ this isit would be a less sweet/saltier chinese sausage.black berries candied sap dessert - WORTH A TRY. Sap looks like sand, but melts in your mouth and leaves you with the foam.It's a fucking trip.Including champagne/soda/coffee came out to:200 + tip. We're coming back for the 15course tasting menu when we have 3 free hours. This place is truly remarkable. I have such a hard time enjoying fine dining, but I was blown away. Also Coi has nothing on this place.NOTHING., 'Benu offers two menus; an a la carte option, as well as a tasting menu (of around 16 courses) that changes daily. We opted for the latter, as it allowed us a whole range of dishes to try.tomato, dashi, summer blossoms & thousand-year-old quail egg, ginger, celery - These first two dishes came out as a pairing. We were instructed to eat the egg first - the salty and rich flavor was accented by a little hit of ginger for an extra burst of flavor. The dashi broth was cool and cleansing; the tomato and summer blossoms added a ummerflavor to this dish.geoduck clam, seaweed, raspberry ponzu & caramelized anchovy geld9e, peanuts,lily bulbs, chili, basil - The geoduck had a fresh and clean flavor, slightly salty of the sea, with a nice hewto it. The seaweed, however, was a little overbearing, bringing even more sea flavor into the dish. The anchovy gelee was wonderful - not overwhelmingly salty or fishy, and complemented by the textural elements of the peanuts and the lily bulbs.veal sweetbreads, yuzu, pickles, mitsuba - These sweetbreads were very delicately fried. The sweetbreads had a meaty, somewhat creamy texture, and the fried batter added a nice crispiness. The yuzu and pickles added some acidity to level out the richness of the dish, which was a definite success.eel, feuille de brick, avocado, crd2me fradcche - Here we have eel and avocado wrapped in dough, for a cigar-like pastry. The avocado was not too noticeable, however the creme fraiche did a good job of adding some light sourness and acidity to go with the fried roll. However, one person found an eel bone in their food! Being someone that spent some time in the ER earlier this year for an eel bone-related incident, this was really disappointing to see.risotto, sea urchin, corn, lovage, black truffle - Risotto with black truffles and...what, sea urchin? Yes, sea urchin. This was my favorite dish of the night. The risotto was simply delicious and rich, and I thought the urchin held its own, adding a clean sea flavor, to go along with the earthiness of the rice and truffles.monkfish liver torchon, apple relish, turnip, sorrel, mustard, brioche - The monkfish came with a delicious, light and buttery brioche. The torchon was very spreadable, though a little fishy. The apple relish added some fresh flavors and crunch to the dish.shark fin soup, dungeness crab, cabbage, Jinhua ham, black truffle custard - Shark fin would be a pretty controversial ingredient for this type of restaurant in San Francisco. That doesn mean you can make a dish inspired by it. The soup has a very rich and deep umami flavor..which really did resemble a shark fin soup. The custard (at the bottom) was so velvety smooth, adding an earthy truffle essense. Really superb dish.abalone vol au vent, cabbage, onion, roasted chicken jus - The abalone, which is a nice big piece, was quite chewy, somewhat tough. That was a little disappointing. The flavor was good, though, and the pastry added a crispy and flaky component that meshed well.pork belly, fermented pepper, cucumber, perilla - A beautiful piece of pork belly was presented next. Though it was relatively lean, it was tender, juicy and flavorful - made even better by its crisped skin. The small balls of cucumber and shiso helped add some lighter flavors to balance out the dish.beef rib cap, crispy maitake mushrooms, lettuce, scallion, garlic - The beef was sliced thin and grilled. It was disappointing, as it was neither juicy nor had the same succulence that meat typically has. In addition, it was served somewhat lukewarm, so the fat in the meat had solidified a bit. The mushrooms were tasty, and the lettuce had a nice, crisp flavor - but the centerpiece of the dish fell flat.sweet rice sorbet, asian pear, pine needle-infused honey - Soothing and refreshing, the asian pear and sweet rice flavors were both evident. I really liked the cookie as well, adding some texture. There was an overarching floral flavor from (I think) the pine-needle infused honey, which was almost too strong.strawberries, vanilla soymilk, buckwheat shortbread, jasmine pearl tea - The strawberries and strawberry sorbet were both good, but the crunchy shortbread and vanilly soymilk foam made the dish for me. The foam was eerily like a vanilla soymilk and went well with the strawberries, and the shortbread added some delicious texture to the dish. However, the jasmine pearl tea gelee on top did not taste like anything, even by itself.Service was exceptional. While most would say that it expected at an establishment like this, I agree that it is. But very often, it not.As for the food, it was a very solid meal, but not without some disappointments. So much of one satisfaction of a meal is based on expectations going in and, admittedly, mine were very high.', One of the best restaurant experience this year. Service, taste, presentation was all in harmony and each plate was pleasurable experience. I have to note that their selection of dinnerware and glassware was great and it really added to the whole experience. And who wouldn't love their surprise chocolate truffles box at the end! They paid great attention to the details on both food and accessories. One thing that was little disappointing was the decor being so beige in main restaurant area but love the fact you can see the kitchen from street level. It's definitely the great addition to SF restaurant scene and can't wait to go back!, As the evening came to an end, with months of anticipation fulfilled, the highlight of the evening was just about to begin.After hearing about my profound and prolonged desire to dine at Benu, our server graciously asked us if we'd like to tour the kitchen and meet Chef Corey Lee.It was a remarkable way to end the night, and after meeting Lee, it is evident his modest and thorough demeanor is reflected in every dish.Cultivating embryos of meticulously fine taste, Lee crafts a meal that likens itself to sharpened platinum. Precise, refined and touched with a dose of elegant curiosity. ---Benu is a symbol of simplicity. The venue is mapped out with almost a chaotic amount of calm. The courtyard entrance is a modern tribute to serenity. Maple trees are carefully arranged around the smooth edges of wood benches. Dreams of a chilled Pinot Grigio with a late summer sun were born on this patio.---A plethora of dishes were enjoyed, and while I can go through each, I'll highlight the stand outs.* Eggplant soup, semi baked tomato, Parmesan, basilBy far my favorite dish of the night. The creamy texture of the soup was cultivated in comfort, and served with guilty pleasure. Parmesan brought the dish together giving the blend a sustained consistency and a delicate break.*Carnaroli risotto, sea urchin, corn, lovage, black truffleThis piece exemplified the fine art Lee was born to gift to the world. The traditional risotta was topped with decadent mounds of uni that enveloped your buds. Corn drizzled throughout the dish develops a nice bite and consistency to the thick risotto. *Beef rib cap, bluefoot mushrooms, mizuna, pine needle honeyRare, tender and flavor rich, this beef was immaculate. The honey layered on the dish was a romantic pairing with the mate deserving beef. Soft Bluefoot mushrooms were hand placed creating a scene fit for the MoMa.Every dish stood out, but for a return visit, I'd place the above request into the kitchen in a heartbeat. Service reminded you of what royalty feels like, and the complimentary chocolates cap the night in sweet fashion.From the handcrafted silverware to the military timing of dishes, Benu is on it's way to becoming the preeminent dining establishment not just of San Francisco but of the country., 'Ie been waiting a few months for Benu to open, ever since I saw a 7x7 article about Corey Lee. It a beautiful restaurant, and everything about the meal and the experience was subtle and minimal. Tomato canape, in dashi -- really interesting. One cherry tomato and one tomato gel thing that bursts open in your mouth. Monkfish liver tourchon -- delicious and rich, but light. Risotto with sea urchin, black truffles, and sweet corn -- best thing I had all night, and the best thing Ie ever had uni in. Big fin squid with pork belly -- very interesting textures. Both kind of toothsome and chewy (but not rubbery). Complemented each other very well. Duck with artichoke -- my second favorite dish. A beautiful piece of duck. I dare say it was better than the duck I had for dinner at Bouchon. Financier with almond milk, fig fruit rollup, shiso, peach sorbet, fresh peach -- not bad, not too sweet. Our server was a delight, and everything else about the night was quite nice. We had a party of 6, so we did individual pairings with half the courses, and bottles for the second half. Not a big wine connoisseur, so Il just say that the wine was good :)Overall, each of us spent around $200 after tip/tax. So, it was a lovely experience, and it clear a lot of love and care went into everything. (like all the custom made glassware/dishware, the little surprises, like the truffle box at the end) But, while all the dishes were great, and there were some interesting combinations & new experiences for me, nothing really sang. It probably just that my expectations were too high. It probably worthwhile to do the tasting menu sometime. For the money, I rather do the omakase at bushi-tei, which has a similar style to Benu, but is a bit more reasonable in price. (~$100 for the tasting menu v. $160 for the tasting menu here)', The food was incredible, the service was amazing and the restaurant is beautiful. I'm not a huge fan of pasta but the spaghettini and rigatoni at Benu are to die for!, 'food was impeccable -- it not fusion but I would call it minimalist classic cuisine with an Asian sensibility. Each plate, from amuse through dessert, is a work of art visually, and flavors are wonderfully intense yet balanced. Service seemed a little less balanced -- they are knowledgeable but they are trying to pull off a more informal vibe -- I not sure how I feel about it, not sure if it works.wine list was well chosen with extensive selection of interesting wines by the glass -- wine prices were not as high as some places of this caliber, BUT the pours were a little on the skimpy side. try to get a reservation NOW before Bauer reviews it... you surely won be able to get in for a LONG TIME after that ... definitely special occasion', I booked our table a month in advance and the staff was more than accommodating when I had to change the date at the last minute. The service was impeccable. The food was neither. I expected to be swept off my feet in a culinary orgasm leaving restaurants like Gary Danko, Cyrus, Saison as mere eateries. In the end, our dinner was hit and miss. Usually, I'm more forgiving in the first month a restaurant is open but for this pedigree and price point I was very disappointed. If you go, definitely try the eggplant soup (I usually avoid such vegetables but this soup and the crispy bites of cheese were like nothing I have had before). The snapping turtle soup was equally as appetizing. The monkfish liver torchon was one of the best dishes we had. However, our entire table compared the sweetbreads to something Kentucky Fried Chicken might put on their menu. Too much breading is an understatement. Pass on the overcooked spaghettini too, you will get better pasta from any casual Italian restaurant. The rigatoni was interesting but undercooked. The 3 oz beef dish was notable but didn't leave anyone mesmerized. The duck was definitely recommendable. We left on a sour note, literally, as our desert came with some sort of foam that all four of us left untouched. Your money ($270 pp for the tasting menu & parings) is paying for the remodeled kitchen and very formal dining room (with no windows) rather than the food. This experience made us realize the value of Saison where you pay for a warehouse setting but the food was indelible. PS - We did not get a chance to order the poularde cooked en vessie because you have to order it three days in advance. Unfortunately, they don't tell you this until you are seated!, 'One of our dinner companions best summed up Benu as a chef folly. How do you spot a chef folly? Here are the signs:-Do a massive restaurant build-out in the worst economic conditions possible-Do a massive restaurant build-out when the trend is minimalist restaurants serving phenomenal food (Commis, Sons/Daughters, Saison)-The kitchen is twice as big as the dining room-The kitchen is in the FRONT of the restaurant and the dining room is at the back (so far back, the restaurant actually has to hire a full-time person that does nothing but ferry diners from the valet station to the front door of the restaurant.-The chef offers a 14-course tasting menu, put quality control is so lax that a pasta dish is so overcooked that it has congealed into a giant ball of dough by the time it arrives tableside-The chef puts a pine fir foam on a dessert rendering it inedible-Of the dozen or so dishes you try, only one was memorable (in a good way - eggplant soup) while several will be long remembered as failures.-Your dinner bill could probably buy you a 3br/2ba foreclosure in FresnoThe exceptions to this folly are the two sommeliers that did a superb job of picking three wines that were delicious, paired wonderfully, and were great values.For as much as Corey Lee promotes his French Laundry pedigree, the only part of this dinner that matches FL is the size of the bill. If FL alums keep pedaling their FL experience to lure in funding and diners and then fail to deliver a FL-worthy experience, Thomas Keller is going to make his employees start signing non-disclosure agreements.My recommendation: You should considering dining at Benu in about a year. By that point, Corey Lee will have fixed the myriad of issues facing Benu or the old Hawthorne Lane space will, once again, be on the market again (although the next restaurateur will need to spend a million of so putting the kitchen back where it belongs).', In a nutshell:Food: 4 starsService: 4 starsP/C (Bang for the Buck): 4.5 starsCutting to the chase, it was one of the most rounded-out and complete dining experiences I've ever had.We walked in about 20 minutes prior to our reservation and weren't sure if there was somewhere to wait. But the maitre d' offered the wine by the glass list and we each got a glass of laurent-perrier while we were waiting. I also took some shots around the restaurant while sipping on the bubbly.My first impression of the restaurant - the interior was very minimal, I liked it, but it almost made me feel like, are they finished with it? It created more room and made it less stuffy but for my taste, it also made the restaurant cold and too simple. Now onto the tasting menu (we also opted for the wine pairing):1. Thousand-year-old quail egg, ginger - the quail egg at first had a little bit of a fermented smell but when you bite into it, it's surprisingly fresh, light yet creamy, nicely balanced by the underhanded aroma of the celery and ginger. 2. Geoduck clam, seaweeds, raspberry-bonito vinegar - the clam pieces had the perfect tender but not-too-tender texture and was well complemented by the acidity of the vinegar. 3. Caramelized anchovy gelee, peanuts, lily bulbs, chil and basil - amazing - the anchovy gelee was so savory and rch in taste, the dried baby anchovy pieces, the smokey peanuts and the crunch pieces of the lily bulbs were so well orchestrated, they were just dancing in my mouth, there was a little heat from the chili, but don't remember basil too much.5. Veal sweeetbreads, yuzu, carrots, pickles, mitsuba: perfectly fried veal sweetbread nuggets were drizzled with the yuzu dressing (subtle and sweet) - the carrots, pickles and the mitsuba gave the delicious nuggets a good crunch.6. Eel, feuille de brick, avocado, creme fraiche - the fried eel/avocado was very good by itself, and the creme fraiche was very good by itself as well, but togeter? not so much, the already very creamy eel/avocado combo was overtaken by the creme fraiche and i couldn't taste the eel (which has a fairly distinct flavor) anymore. i would have opted for a berry-inspired dressing...7. risotto,sea urchin, corn, lovage and black truffle - i died and went to the risotto heaven, the grains wre perfectly cooked, the sauce was creamy and well seasoned, the black truffle flavor was really traveling throughout. the only thing was, the black truffle didn't really help accentuate the sweet, creamy taste of sea urchin, it suppressed the flavors a bit.8. monkfish liver torchon, turnip, onion cherry - brilliant...i've tasted monkfish liver at izakaya's but definitely not as well treated as this one. the creaminess was perfecltly balanced with the sweet/tarness of the cherries.9. shark's fin soup - once you have a sip of the broth, you just feel good, like you're at home eating your mom's soup. all the ingredients used here are fairly intense individually, but they are so well integrated and married to create this perfect, stick-to-your bone dish10. abaolone vol au vent - such a satisfying piece of vol au vent. the abalone was so well cooked and seasoned, nicely complemented by the flaky aspect of the vol au vent crust.11. pork belly, fermented pepper, cucumber, and perilla - this was one my least favorite, the belly was bit salty and i didn't get too much perilla 12. beef rib cap, crispy maitake mushrooms, lettuce, scallion, asian pear - awesome, the meat was perfectly seasoned, the asian pear puree was brilliant, sweet and buttery. the only thing is that i wish that the meat were a little warmer.13. sweet rice sorbet, pine nut puree, pine needle infused honey - oh my goodness, i had overlooked this dish when i was looking at the menu but when i tasted it, it had everything that i was looking for, nutty, a tad sweet, tang from the honey and the texture from the puree.14. strawberries, vanilla soymilk, buckwheat sable, green tea - the green tea was the only component that i did not get but it was a pretty decent dessert, nothing that i'd wow myself on.Cheese course -pretty decent but not as memorable as Cyrus or Gary Danko.Wine pairing - Michael Ireland did an awesome job explaining the pairing and took us through different parts of the world.The service - service was spot on, other than a few small cracks here and there - the intervals among the food dishes were inconsistent, and the timing for the wine was way before the dish was served. Other than that - wonderful. After-dinner - we were offered to go into the kitchen and meet the staff including Corey Lee and we talked for good 10 minutes - about the restaurant, dishware, ingredients, etc. We were also offered drinks to take outside and chill at the garden.In conclusion: I'd go back in a heartbeat. It was such a complete experience. I'd give the restaurant one more month to smooth out the service aspect., 'This place is pretty crazy. My boyfriend and I have been to our fair share of fancy restaurants in San Francisco and this is probably our favorite. The food is prepared to perfection and presentation is nothing less than what you would expect from Corey Lee. The food will definitely leave you smiling. We tried the a la carte menu, but we will be going back to try the 15 course prix fix.', Did I eat at the same place as some of these reviewers? I had an 8pm reservations at this restaurant this past week and was very excited to eat here, but what a disaster the dining experience was! First, the good: I really like the minimalist decor and the dining room. It was very modern and the carpeted floor is a nice touch. The wine list was pretty good and the wines by the glass were actually quite good. The bottle of Riesling we had was one of the best Riesling I've ever had and I'm a huge Riesling fan! The bad: Dinner took 3.5 hours, yup 3.5 hours for 4 courses and each course took 1 hour to come out. WTH? And the portions are small, very very small. The waitress informed us that the tasting menu is a 3 hour commitment but this is entirely not true. A couple sat right next to us who had the tasting menu and they were there way before we were. Each course would take about 5 minutes to eat because the portions were so small and 55 minute to wait. By the second course, i was really to go home. The food itself, while decent, was not remarkable and definitely NOT worth the price. I had the apple celery salad which was basically a few slices of apples, celery and pears. Good but not remarkable. My boyfriend had the veal sweetbreads which tasted like soggy chicken nuggets. Not spectacular. For the second course I had the sphaghettini which was my favorite course other than dessert. This actually was quite good. The bf, had the risotto with the uni which was ok. The rice was a bit hard. Bt the time the third course came around, I wanted to lie down and go to sleep. The waiting was just too painful! I had the squid which was quite good, especially paired with the pork. The boyfriend had the scallops which was not remarkable at all. The fourth course finally came out but at 11pm at night, I was just done eating in general. I tasted the lamb I ordered and it was very gamey. The boyfriend had the beef rib cap and it was just meh, not remarkable. We did have the financier for dessert and it was very good. Bottom line is this place is good, but definitely not worth the money. Stick with Gary Dankos!, One of the best meals I've ever had. Formal dinner and formal food but not overbearing atmosphere. Every dish we had was excellent, but what shone the most was the eggplant soup and the presentation of the truffles at the end of the meal (at which point we were too full to eat many of them, but tried to anyway). Though the dishes are small, they are all rich. The beef was also amazing. The wine list is short but both affordable and rare, depending on what you're looking for, without being overwhelming. The sommelier was very helpful and never made me feel either cheap or uneducated - and picked out some excellent wine for us.The chef took us back in to the kitchen after the meal - it's huge, as big as the dining room, and immaculate. Not sure if they do this for everyone or just were doing it right after the opening, but it's worth going back if you get the chance. Oh, and there's one dish you have to pre-order - by 2 days - so look at the menu and decide before you show up., 1)French Laundry's head chef Corey Lee's Signature restaurant.Hottest fine dinning in SF, however it's overheated....Open kitchen is a big plus but the taste is a little bit disappointed.Langoustine soup is big surprise but that's about it.$160.00 tasting I will try next time but for now $100.00 per person for 4 courses.....I really wish Chef Lee will have a huge success in BENU. But for now, let's wait a bit., Good not great. Tasting menu kind of fishy. Won't recommend this place to my friends., 'The good part: There are some truly inspired and exceptional dishes on the menu. The risotto with black truffle and sea urchin is the best offering on any menu in San Francisco now. The scallops were perfectly prepared (granted, the entree size only has 2). Sweetbreads and the eggplant soup are both highly recommended.The challeges: Service fell apart after the pasta course. When the fish course was served it took several minutes for the wine to arrive (which had been ordered at the beginning) and we only had a few bites left. And then 29 munutes between fish and meat course. Capped off by my pressenting payment then the server returning to table with a different amount on the recipt as he had forgotten to add everything initially.', Four of us went on a Friday night and it proceeded to take 4 hours. We started with a cheese plate that was very tasty (although our waiter told us we should end with it instead). I would recommend the risotto, the monkfish liver torchon, and the lamb. Had the beef rib cap and was assured it was different and unique, but it wasn't really. Overall, nice meal but small portions because each is a small plate. The desserts were very good. You can go on a kitchen tour after your meal and meet Chef Corey as well., 'Reservations were on 9/18 @ 8:30. We showed up early but were seated nonetheless. Mickey Bauer sat two tables over from us with his partner. Mike, if you don want to be recognized, stop taking pictures of each course (they had the tasting menu) with your camera phone using flash.Anyways, food (tasting menu) was amazing and service was on point. Bold wine pairings (e.g., 1968 madera). Although the food is very different, Benu is analogous to momofuku ko in that both restaurants are singular embodiments of one person vision (Lee and Chang respectively). I came away from my visits to these two places feeling the same way: although not every dish was fitting of my particular tastes, the ones that stood out were transcendental in nature and at the end of the meal I felt like I had just engaged in a 3 hour heart felt conversation with the chef without saying a word.I highly recommend the tasting menu. The uni risotto, the shark fin soup, and the eel cigar were amazing. Very possibly the best meal in 2010.', 'This place is all kinds of awesome. We had the tasting menu: Fifteen courses of goodness -- some of which was decidedly not consistent with my Paleo approach to eating, like the incredibly delicious uni, corn and black truffle risotto. But whatever -- my if youe going to make an exception to your diet, make sure it worth it rule is still in effect. I downed everything save for some pieces of toasted brioche that came with the silky-rich monkfish liver torchon. My favorite dish was one of the smallest: caramelized anchovy geld9e with peanuts, lily bulbs, chili and basil. I could have eaten a fist-sized portion of that and still ask for seconds.Service was impeccable. I especially appreciated the server impromptu discourse on how to make peanut butter pancakes with bacon grease. They come out hard, like bacon-y pancake cookies, he said. Like I said: Awesome.', My husband took me here for my 31st Birthday this year, though a month late since reservations were soo hard to come by. Better late than never I always say. I had heard positive reviews from our friends who had dined at Benu 2 nights prior. We'll be watching to see if Benu makes the Michelin list.We had the tasting menu which consisted of:-(*)tomato, dashi, summer blossoms-geoduck clam, seaweeds, rasberry-bonito vinegar-carmaelized anchovy gelee, peanuts, lily bulbs, chili, basil-veal sweetbreads, yuzu, carrots, pickles, mitsuba-eel, feuille de brick, avocado, creme fraiche-(*)risotto, sea urchin, corm lovage, black truffle-monkfish liver torchon, almond, endive, cherry-(*)shark's fin soup, dungaeness crab, cabbage, jinhua ham, black truffle custard-abalone vol au vent, spinach, artichoke, chanterelles, roasted chicken jus-pork belly, sea cucumber, cucumber, fermented pepper, perilla-eight treasure duck-sweet rice sorbet, asian pear puree, pine needle-infused honey-(*)huckleberries, lemon curd, vanilla sponge, yogurt-chocolates, coffee, tea (*) = FavoritesOur two favorite dishes were the tomato, dashi, summer blossoms & the risotto as they burst with flavor.I'm a huge duck fan so I had high hopes for the eight treasure duck, however this was probably my least favorite dish. It was more of a duck sausage. The sommelier was quite knowledgable, though I wish that they included a list of the tasting wines like they do with the tasting menu. My husband was glad to see the Hitachino Nest. Note to server: Next time do not serve a course if a member of the party is in restroom and not at the dining table., thanks to the hubby for taking me to benu for my birthday this year. chef corey lee is amazing. we loved all of our dishes from the pasta appetizers (oxtail rigatoni and spaghettini) to the main courses (rib eye and fish with rice). i can't wait to go back., 'An Asian styled tasting menu. Momofuku--Ko? Not quite. Four stars.', 'Loved benu!! We went here last night for dinner and the service was impeccable. Now on to the food.. got off to a rocky start with the *complimentary* ginger bubble dish (yuck!) which tasted like pickle juice that just bursts in your mouth after you pop the bubble. Definitely an acquired taste. However!! The rest was fabulous. We tried a bunch of different dishes that ranged from asian fusion to italian tastes with a bit of everything else in between :) Teeny-tiny portions (which surprisingly fill you up fast!) , beautifully placed on adorable dishes. The following was to die for...* monkfish liver (OMG yummy!!) - comes with toast to spread it on * risotto with sea urchin & truffles* beef cheeks w/ mustard greens* duck w/ artichoke We tried all the different desserts and they were delightful. Everything was beautifully prepared. Highly recommend :) .', 'When I first walked in, I was unsure what to think of the space. It felt a bit...closed in. It probably because of the sunken floor and the lack of any windows.The food was good although unsure if it was memorable. There were definitely high notes but each dish seemed like it was trying a bit too hard except there was this simple pork belly and squid dish that was really really good. The combination of ingredients was perfect.Sommelier was very helpful and picked some really nice wines by the glass that paired really well.Overall I thought the place was good. But...not $400-for-two kinda good. I think there are many places that are better for around that price. It has a slightly stuffy atmosphere and I sure that a plus for some people. Just not me.', 'I was extremely excited to go to Benu. When I first called there, I was told it would be three months and that they were totally booked. Then, lucky me, I found a reservation online at Opentable. (Also makes me wonder why I was never contacted since I asked the reservationist if I could be placed on a waitlist, which, she assured me, she would do.)I am going to be a little hyper critical of my review as this is one of the most expensive restaurants in town right now.So let start off with the fact that while I find the dining room to be elegant and minimalistic (of course, so one can see the beauty of every dish) what I found is that the lighting is off a little. Can quite place it, but it is either too commercial or....see for yourself. When we sat down our delightful server mentioned to us that there was the choice of the 12-course tasting menu ($180 per person) or a-la-carte. We really had originally planned on a-la-carte. He then proceeded to tell us that it be wise to order around 3-4 items as the dishes are small in nature. (More on this later). As for the food, everything was pretty good. When you have a world class chef open his own restaurant one should expect world class food. Corey Lee delivers. However...Sweetbreads...fried little squares and the sweetbreads were just on the verge of being overdone. This is a tough one as the squares are so small that just a second more and they would have been chewy. My friends Risotto with sea urchin was absolute velvet and flavorful.My friend had the Sablefish gratin which was quite interesting (cabbage was a little mushy) while I had the Big Fin Squid with Pork Belly. I understand the squid being a stronger fish, however, I thought the pork belly to be just a tad too chewy.I ordered the lamb and my friend the beef caps....simply marvelous. For dessert I ordered the Huckleberry w. Douglas Fir meringue (OMG delish) and he had the soft chocolate ganache. Amazing unique flavors and textures.Now...here is my issue....I understand 5 star restaurants having dined at many in San Francisco incuding Gary Danko, Masa, Michael Mina, Boulevard, the new Prospect, etc. Here it is....we left feeling hungry especially after paying $300 for two. I understand that these plates are small, however, these portions, in my opinion, we too small. To order four or five courses would have been equivalent to just ordering the tasting menu.I get tasting menu portions. However, I firmly believe the a la carte menu should be looked at when considering portions. In other words I felt the a la carte portions to be the same size as a tasting menu portion.I completely understand the price points. However, at these prices there should be more. I believe my friends and my beef and lamb had maybe 3-4 oz. of meat. The sweetbreads only a few cubes.The food and service was exceptional for the most part. When paying that much money for a dinner, I firmly believe one should not leave a restaurant hungry.This restaurant is only 6 weeks old and I do hope they might review their tasting menu portions vs. their a la carte menu.My friend asked me as we were leaving if I would go back. My answer was maybe. Mr. Lee is a very talented chef, but in the end, I do not know if it is quite worth it.This restaurant is only 6 weeks old, and I hope this team will review their pricing vs. their portion size, especially in this economy. I am not asking for the supersize portion...just a portion that when two people leave a dining experience they don need to go home to have a snack.', 'benu is the long awaited new restaurant in SF from French Laundry Alum and James Beard Award-winning chef Corey Lee. His old boss Thomas Keller is a partner in this new venture and has a wine locker by the front door. benu is housed where Hawthorne Lane used to be. We dined early on, during their 3rd week of operation. benu is a small product driven restaurant focused on contemporary American cuisine. benu is an Egyptian word and that stands for the phoenix, a symbol of something constantly renewing.They take reservations 60 days out and were fully booked the last we checked, indicating that interest here is high, even in the midst of the economic downturn. You need to call right when they open for reservations each morning, to lock one up. Also note that the a la carte Poularde cut en vessie served in 2 courses requires 3 days advanced notice.Picks:Bread alternative - Toasted Nori Lavash, thin, chewy, and crispy buckwheat wafers with sesame served in a custom box.Canapd9 of dashi broth, seaweed, cucumber blossoms, cherry tomato, with a molecular tomato water sphere gel blob (sodium and calcium reaction) that exploded with flavor when slurped up in a mouthful. This brought back memories of Fat Duck.eggplant soup, semi-baked tomato, parmesan, basil ($12) began our benu culinary travel. This was an interestingly rich soup possessing both sweet and creamy flavors, nice tomatoey garnish. The various flavors ramped up to a crescendo during each spoonful.lobster bouillon, bd9arnaise custard, English peas, carrots, tarragon ($14) was a beautiful dish that highlighted an East meets West fusion. Light broth, fresh but a tick overcooked lobster, and a hidden vat of slightly over steamed custard in bottom of the bowl. We felt the two major elements didn integrate well.veal sweetbread grenobloise, cauliflower, parsley, lemon, caper ($14) had three high-quality chewy chunks of veal innards with a lemon caper essence. Very good execution but not top notch. So good we forgot to take a picture!carnaroli risotto, sea urchin, corn, lovage, black truffle ($22) was the first reference quality dish. The creamy risotto was very well done, and filled with bits of corn. Lots of well-prepared fresh sea urchin lined the surface. We had a lot of sea urchin recently at nearby Ame that just paled when compared to this. This good-sized dish anchored our pasta course.St. Peter Fish (John Dory) a la francaise, shrimp mouse, onions, bacon, black truffle ($28) came in the shape of the sushi like roll. The shaped white fish was situated above the shrimp mousse, forming a unique cylindrical shape. This combination was not creamy, had a soft texture, and well melded flavors. Tender chunks of bacon were on the side to give it some zing.sablefish gratin, cabbage, rice, beech mushrooms, spicy pepper, Asian pear ($26) was the superior fish of the evening with tender, creamy textures, logical combinations, and a well portioned size. Beautiful, yet tiny beech mushrooms.sea scallops Emmanuelle, endive, grapes, verjus, almonds, brown butter ($24) were excellent. Both sauteed scallops were cooked perfectly and included caramelized crusty tops. One scallop was chopped in two, while the other scallop was encrusted with almonds. The crunchiness of the nuts along with the scallop texture made for very memorable bites. The 2 sauces were nice but unnecessary to enjoy the freshness of the scallops.Beautiful Palate cleanser of a green grape gelee cube with crispy almonddry-aged prd9 sald9 lamb rack, garlic sausage, potato confit, chanterelles, lemon peel, coastal succulents ($30) was an excellent dish with a perfect level of saltiness. High-quality lamb possessed no gaminess and came in two good-sized pieces. It had been marinated for a day in a citrus, apple solution. The ausagewas more of a high-quality deli thin cold cut of lamb.beef rib cap (tender cap of the ribeye), bluefoot mushrooms, mizuna, pine needle honey ($32) was one of the better dishes at the evening. Very tender beef cooked to a nice juicy medium rare and accented nicely with the exotic mushrooms. The Japanese Mustard gave this dish its Asian flair.Cheese dessert course - specially made and selected by Andante Dairy, Petaluma ($16) was excellent, featuring top caliber cheese. French Laundry uses Andante butter. We choose samples of all five, which seemed to show a slant toward softer cheeses. Two goats milk cheeses (one with rosemary, the other with thyme), two cows milk cheeses', 'Fantastic.', 'My trip to Benu was very special for three reasons. My boyfriend and I were dining here to celebrate our 1 year anniversary (first special reason!) and this would be the finest of dining either of us had ever experienced in our separate lives, as well as together, ever (second special reason!!). But let talk more about the third reason. While working for Google, I was able to attend a special speaking event about the upcoming restaurant opening of Benu, with special guest speaker chef and owner Corey Lee. During this event he gave us lucky audience members a behind-the-scenes look into what it takes to open a restaurant. He spoke about coming up with the name, Benu, which if I remember correctly is of Egyptian origin meaning rise to brilliance (I hope that right!). The many, MANY people involved in the planning and decision making. The support he received from everyone including friends, family, colleagues and even people that could be considered competition. He also talked about the numerous materials and shapes he tested for the flatware rest. Sounds like a simple item right? He mentioned the ceramic company in South Korea who make absolutely stunning pieces from teapots to trays to plates and bowls. And he laughed when he told the story of how none of the artists he was working with on the serving pieces in Korea knew how to draw a savory truffle, which was something he wanted to add to the lid of a serving piece for a special dish on the tasting menu. So he asked his mother, who knew very well what it was, to draw it for this piece. So if you are lucky enough to try the sharks fin soup, dungeness crab, cabbage, Jinhua ham with truffle custard, make sure to look at the lid! So going into this dinner knowing the blood, sweat and tears that went into the making and birth of Benu, it made my experience unbelievably special.I already had the pleasure of speaking with the GM, Marc Hartenfels, prior to our dinner when I contacted Benu about hosting a event for my company. During our communication, I mentioned my food allergies to Marc so that I could enjoy the tasting menu and he assured me that the Chef would be able to accommodate my special request. It was an absolute pleasure working with Marc and an even greater pleasure meeting him on the evening of our dinner. And as promised, the chef delivered a fantastic alternative to some of the dishes that were on the original tasting menu that I was restricted from eating due to my allergy to fish. From the moment Calvin and I walked into the restaurant, to the moment we left, we loved every bit of our time there. As others have mentioned, the food is outstanding, amazing, *insert every adjective for fanfuckingtastic here*. So I won make this review all about the food. The service, the interior, the location. Great, Great, Great. The genius behind the food. Great. The heart behind everything Benu stands for, priceless.', I've never been to French Laundry so I can't compare it to that, but I did have high expectations from here since the chef/owner was the chef de cuisine at French Laundry previously.Monkfish liver - loved itGrilled beef salad - very averageEggplant soup - goodDuck - really yummyLamb - really yummyShrimp and snapping turtle - salty and disappointingCheese course - goodSea urchin risotto - really goodEach plate is appetizer size so for a light eater, you need at least 3 dishes. For a bigger appetite, you probably could eat 5 plates. The restaurant was a bit loud and the waiters were walking around all the time so it got a bit distracting and annoying.Overall, this place is solid, but I would stay away from dishes that are remotely have Asian twist to them. I think it's a rip to pay $20-$30 a plate for refined Asian food. Maybe cuz I'm Asian. It was a good one-time experience., 'Oh man, if only I made more $, I be here again and again! My good friend and I came here for dinner last night and we went for it - we went for the oh-so-lovely tasting menu. First off, I have the say, the service was so nice from the host gentleman to the waitstaff (hi Molly!), to the parking attendants - loved it! Alongside with wonderful tasting food, their service would edge them above the rest big-time! Oh, and I loved the little b magnets you get with the menu and bill - I got 5 and they are all over my refrigerator! :)Stand-outs from the tasting menu were:* Lonsdale (this is genius, a serious burst of flavor in your mouth of cool, fruitiness that is refreshing and surprising in such an awesome way!)* Sea urchin and almond tofu, caviar, sparkling grape (the sea urchin was a nice salty taste against the balanced sweetness of the almond tofu - delectable!)* Eel, feuille de brick, creme fraiche, caramelized anchovy, peanut, lily bulb, mountain yam, and shrimp souffle (this was like little tastes within the tasting menu - each were such a nice balance against each other, and I loved the delicateness of the lily bulb, fried eel - yum, I love things fried and the eel with the creme fraiche was looooved)* Monkfish liver tourchon, turnip, pea, mustard and brioche (I did not know what to expect, but I loooved this, the monkfish was so smooth and creamy with a little bit of the tastes on top of the brioche -- mmm! Unexpected lovely taste!)* Shark fin soup, dungeness crab, cabbage, Jinhua ham, black truffle custard (this soup sort of tasted a bit like miso but so much better, and I am now such a fan of black truffle, I wanted MORE of this soup - pretty please! I scooped up every last bit)* Beef rib cap, matsuke mushroom, pine nut, pine needle honey, mitsuba (oh yummm! The flavoring of the beef was most outstandingly tasty, I don know how they got so much flavor into the meat, it was was woooonderful)* Huckleberry sorbet, yogurt, lemon curd, vanilla sponge (the sorbet was nicely tart and fruity, a good almost-finish to the meal as there was a couple more dessert tastes after this, great flavor!)Honestly, we enjoyed every bit of the tastes we had here last night. I could tell there was so much care and detail in every dish they turned out, and the display of the food was so picturesque - loved it!! Probably the best meal I have ever had!! - and Ie had a lot of good meals, especially in SF. I would love to taste their tasting menu again soon (very soon) as it changes quite often!! Thank you, Benu, for coming to San Francisco - you are a GEM!! :)', A ZEN fine dining experience with CREATIVE FLAIR and some room for improvement.There's a sense of serenity in the air as you walk pass the zen-like garden entrance that leads into the restaurant. One can peek into the open kitchen from the garden. The dining room is understated in its simplicity. Given the rave reviews, the only way to go was to get the asian-inspired tasting menu. Each course came out beautifully on delicate plates, bowls and mini utensils. Corey Lee's creativity shines through; with some dishes more successful than others.C1- The thousand year old quail egg londsale - a refreshing surprise to begin the meal (this was my favorite)C2- sea urchin and almond tofu - the sea urchin was good but I didn't like the texture of the almond tofu with this dishC3 - abalone grenobloise - delicious and tenderC4 - eel fuiille de brick - whimsical tasty fried eel sticksC5 - monkfish liver with brioche - silky and smooth (my 2nd favorite)C6 - crispy cod miltC7 - shark fin soup - light and tasty...different from the typical shark fin soup served at wedding banquetsC8 - pumpkin porridge with lobster and black truffle - comforting and rich...a tasting size is just about rightC9 - eight treasure duck - too well done and not my favorite way to prepare duckC10 - beef rib cap - too well done and could be betterC11 - huckleberry sorbet - very refreshing but I like Naia sorbet moreC12 - chestnut custard - a velvety chestnut dessertC13 - chocolates - came in a cute box ... there's always room for chocolate :)The waitress took us back to the kitchen and it was cool to meet Corey Lee. I would love to see him compete on Top Chef Masters., 'Terrific, creative food.Calm, lovely, simple atmosphere that grew on me as the evening went on.Stunning tableware. (Especially the flatware rest! I was obsessed with it, it was hard to stop playing with it in between courses.) I also loved the sort of nerdy glassware and 5 tined forks. A blend of zen, cerebralness and elegance. Well done.Funny crowd. A mix of suits and ties, and ripped jeans. Showy dresses and understated taste. So San Francisco.We skipped the tasting menu. I like a good splurge, but $160 per person is too rich for my blood by about $30. So we ordered a la carte to our hearts content and still came out ahead. The appetizers were where it was at. By far they exceeded the mains. I had looked forward to the lamb all day, but thought it was too subtle to really rave about. The beef similarly, was fantastically executed but not special. The apps on the other hand...damn. The simple, so simple, parsnip soup with a hint of vanilla - paired perfectly with a white Burgundy - was right on the money, as was the terrific monkfish liver tourchon (overpowered a bit by the brioche but I ain gonna complain about homemade brioche) and the absolutely stellar abalone.Dessert was not only creative and well done, but fun.My only real complaint was that the service was rocky. Our waitress was incredibly knowledgable about food and wine but a bit too present. She interrupted us three times, apologizing, but yet, still doing it. Why rush us? I also caught her about to approach us several times, but then changing her mind, and pivoting back. I don mind really, but when I spending $300 on dinner, I want to focus on my date, not on the wait staff antics.', Perfect quantity (left full but not sick), timing (2 hrs. 45 mins. for 13 courses), service. The dining room has sufficient space between tables, but is a little cave-like, being windowless.The dishes had a lot of congruity: many of them were seafood of mild briny-ness (uni, milt-ugh, monkfish liver), almost all had a custard-y texture, and three dishes had black truffles. My favorite was the lobster-black-truffle porridge. And the crispy small eel. Oh, and the soup with black-truffle custard. Haven't been able to get into French Laundry, but I've been to Per Se and prefer Benu, which didn't overdo the desserts., 'yes^13.', 'For, now this review is a placeholder until I can fully describe how I felt about this meal.But for now, holy crap... WOW. Tasting menu. Worth it.My signed copy of the tasting menu will be framed and hung in the kitchen.', 'The food at Benu totally captured my heart. Chef Corey Lee took many Asian comfort foods and elevated them to a completely different level. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of eating at a ine diningrestaurant while also being embraced by the comforts and memories of home and my family with his food. The chef tasting menu showcased a multitude of flavors, textures, and techniques. Some of my favorites from the 11+ courses...SEA URCHIN, ALMOND TOFU, CAVIAR - the almond tofu was a bit too thick, but its milky, nuttiness accentuated the sweetness of the creamy sea urchin inside. All nicely balanced with the salty pearls of caviar and the acidity of the sparkling grape foam. SPANISH MACKEREL - incredible. I love, love, LOVED this dish! The fish was cooked between two thin slices of crispy bread, but it looked like one seamless piece (almost like pork belly). I was swooning over the moist, meaty fish with its salty, garlicky crust...perfectly balanced by the dehydrated slivers of lemon. The flavors and textures were similar to fried fish, but so much more sophisticated. I already planning on coming back for this dish on the a la carte menu...it *that* good! MONKFISH LIVER TORCHON - one of my absolute favorites! This was very similar in style and technique to the foie gras torchon I had at French Laundry, although the use of monkfish liver (instead of duck liver) made it much lighter with soft sweet undertones. Creamy, luscious liver spread over a warm, buttery brioche...sexy, elegant, and rich all at once. I even licked my knife to make sure I got every last bit! SHARK FIN SOUP, DUNGENESS CRAB, BLACK TRUFFLE CUSTARD - such genius! The custom-made bowl held a thin layer of silky, black truffle custard at the bottom, which was covered by a warm dashi (fish broth), faux strands of shark fin made of gelatin, and sweet, succulent pieces of crab...sooooo sumptuous and delicious! I would have never thought of truffles with Asian food, especially something as traditional as shark fin soup, but I was floored by how good this dish was. The black truffle added a whole new dimension to the soup. PUMPKIN PORRIDGE, LOBSTER, TRUFFLE - again, Chef Lee demonstrates his creativity with Asian cuisine by taking something as humble as rice porridge and turning it into something so luxurious. I loved the sweetness of the pumpkin and lobster against the distinct earthiness of the truffles. I also appreciated having warm, comforting courses (soup and porridge) in the tasting menu - it goes down so easily and is especially soothing after drinking lots of wine. There were a couple of misses on the tasting menu, but the high points more than made up for them. Next time, I going to order off Benu a la carte menu since it also featured some of my favorites from the tasting menu (I especially loved the seafood dishes). I also appreciated the thought and creativity that went into the design of the ceramics and plates.The only thing I didn particularly care for about the restaurant was its bland interior. It had a cold, unfinished feel with the high ceilings and beams, sharp angles, and the almost all white dd9cor. The service also lacked warmth, but was very polite and attentive. With a little more tweaking and finesse, Benu could be something magnificent. The restaurant has a lot of potential, and I look forward to the continued growth of Chef Lee career.**For the full review and pics, visit my blog link under my profile. Enjoy!**', 'Reviewed by Kel4.5, but Il round up. :)I don know if it a good thing or bad thing that this restaurant is a block from our house. Ask my bank account and my waistline in about six months.The husband and I had the tasting menu last night and now I can stop thinking about the experience. We are are very simple peeps. As a couple that normally eats $5 footlong Subway sandwiches during the week, we are, by no means, oodies.But we do appreciate unique dining experiences a few times a year. While the husband grades everything on a Mmm, good / yuck, bad scale, I enjoy tasting the full range of textures and flavors in every bite. And textures/flavors, this meal did have.Growing up in a Chinese household and eating traditional Asian foods probably influenced my opinion of Benu. Do you remember the scene in Pixar Ratatouille when Anton Ego (the food critic) tries Remy rendition of ratatouille and is taken back to his childhood? Well, my experience at Benu was just like that. :) I really enjoyed the Asian inspiration in the dishes on the menu. Thousand-year-old-egg, sea urchin, abalone, anchovy, monkfish liver, shark fin soup, porridge, and duck, five spice seasoning, chestnut... these are items I grew up eating. So, tasting Corey Lee interpretation of these items was both very refreshing and comforting. I imagine that my dining experience would have been quite different if I wasn familiar with the foods already.Items I especially enjoyed:- Sea urchin and almond tofu, caviar, sparkling grape (sea urchin was super fresh with natural sweetness and saltiness of the ocean. The gumminess of the almond tofu mellowed out the flavor, plus salty pop of caviar eggs and sweet acidity of the grape paired perfectly.)- Abalone grenbloise, cauliflower, caper, lemon (who can resist gently deep fried abalone? Much better than the abalone interpretation I had at Coi last year)- Monkfish liver torchon, turnip, persimmon mustard, brioche (Sublime butterly flavor and gelatin/mouse-like texture. And oh, the brioche! Wish I could order a loaf of that. YUM. What a fantastic take on pate + bread.)- Shark fin soup, dungeness crab, cabbage, Junhua ham, black truffle custard (the black truffle custard was heaven.)- Eight treasure duck (gah, can even describe this in words. Such a delicious treat.)- Chestnut custard, cranberry, mace ice cream, arlette (loved the seasonal flavors in this dessert)- And, of course, the divine chocolates at the very end of the mealSome other random things that I loved about the dining experience: The dishware. The gorgeous dishware! I loved the shapes and textures of all the dishware the food was presented with. The smooth wooden utensil rest, the flat, round, speckled plates, the spectacular wooden puzzle of a box that the chocolates were presented in.... the dishware itself was art.The decor: Some people would disagree, but I liked the understated, comfortable, and unstuffy dining room. It made the entire meal much more approachable and it was like a blank slate for the food art to be presented in. One minus was the draped fabric on the ceiling. I found it a tad distracting to an otherwise impeccable dining room. The courtyard upon entering the area is also very lovely. Just don look up or youl see the remnants of the ugly, abandoned concrete office building on Folsom Street. :POh, and if youe wondering, Benu is much better than Coi. Husband and I ate at Coi last year and I felt there were some misses on that menu. While there were some dishes I enjoyed more than others at Benu, I wouldn classify any of the plates as misses.In sum, our meal at Benu was exquisite, unique, and memorable. The service was knowlegeable and sincere. We had a table that looked straight down the main aisle of the restaurant into the kitchen, and I enjoyed watching the staff nimbly and gracefully weave through the tables and around each other, like a choreographed dinner dance. :) I hope to return soon for the a la carte menu to try some new items and order some of my favorites again.', 'As with the previous reviewer, this is really a 4.5 star review rounded up. And youl see why I round up at the end of this review.Let start with the bad news: The ambiance is sterile, colorless, quiet and cold ... both figuratively and literally (I was sorry I let the maitre put my coat away). The woman next to me had her coat covering her the whole time like a blanket, and at some point actually fell asleep under it.You would think that meant the food was likewise uninspired, but you would be wrong (I not sure what was wrong with her, but she seemed very tired). The good news is that the food WAS inspired, and the service warm and well-paced. The waitstaff was friendly, well-informed, and appeared to work together unselfishly to ensure that our courses were perfectly timed.There a choice of a la carte items, or the 13-course tasting menu. We chose the tasting menu. My husband commented on how there were no amuse bouches that were not listed on the menu - no surprises - but I liked that everything was written out for you, amuse and all.The menu is challenging - not many people know that a lonsdale is a cocktail from London, or eat abalone often, much less see it grenobloise, or know what cut of beef the rib cap is, much less tried it before. But great flavors and textures are undeniable, and Chef Lee menu provides both, even if some of the dishes are complex and have unfamiliar components. For SF foodies that really know their food, hel show you something new AND great. For those a little afraid of terms like feuille de brick (a crispy dough) or grenobloise (browned butter sauce), youl have to excuse Chef Lee 3-Michelin star training. There nothing weird or scary about his food, and despite his fancy terms, youl recognize most of it when you see it. Youe just never seen it done so well, or tasted it done quite like that before, and I mean that in a good way. For instance, what he describes as caramelized anchovy, something I thought I never tried before, tasted exactly like a dried, preserved fish that any Asian would recognize, especially when paired with peanut as he does.There are lots of dishes that bear mentioning:*thousand-year-old quail egg with lonsdale - a refreshing way to start (even if the popping of the lonsdale bubble surprised me and the liquid went down my windpipe causing me to have a 2-minute coughing fit)*sea urchin and almond tofu, caviar, sparkling grape - combo sweet and salty, with distinct background of almond and ocean somehow equals Wow!*eel, feuille de brick, creme fraiche - anything is better with creme fraiche, but especially this crispy, salty eel-filled edible cigar*monkfish liver torchon - the foie gras of the sea, but even more delicate, and served with warm French Laundry-style brioche toast*pumpkin porridge, lobster, black truffle - really rich lobster and pumpkin flavorBut there were two dishes, in particular, that took the meal to another level altogether:***The beef rib cap, with matsutake mushroom, pine needle honey, Asian pear puree and mitsuba was hands down the best beef Ie ever had, period. The beef itself was simple and perfect, with the most unbelievably even distribution of fat Ie ever encountered. The beef itself tasted great, and had better mouth feel than the best Kobe and Wagyu Ie had anywhere in Japan and the U.S.***We were skeptical about the risotto with white truffles from Alba, and the $50 supplement it apparently warranted, not to mention the pomp and circumstance with which it was presented - they bring out a fancy wooden box containing 3-4 very plump white truffles and the shaving tool, and shave it right onto your plate of risotto. And to start, Mark and I are not truffle fans, as we have found most of the time that the truffle adds nothing but a dirty, woodsy taste that doesn belong with, and even takes away from, the dish. This can be said for every dish we had from the special truffle menu at Alain Ducasse NY, and numerous other truffle dishes at the likes of Gary Danko, Fleur de Lys and Fifth Floor. So far, the only place wee ever enjoyed truffle the way it should be enjoyed is at the French Laundry. Well ... I happy to say Chef Lee knows his truffle, and he knows what to do with it. The fragrance from these white truffles from Alba were strong in the best way. It was intriguing, rather than off-putting ... inviting us to dig into the rich, creamy risotto. The risotto itself was simple, but truly (and I mean TRULY) perfect, with the white truffle shavings melding into the creamy, al dente risotto, which we later learned was made with butter that sits overnight in the same container as the white truffles.At this point, Ie forgotten my skepticism of all things truffle, I no longer feel the cold, and I barely notice the woman next to me that has fallen asleep. Shel wake up for this, I sure. If not, maybe I can steal it from her.', (See pics. Courtesy of Mark)More of 3.8 stars.This place reminds me of Coi, the cool and calm sense of setting and chilled or slightly warm food style .It's so different from the old restaurant Two where they now moved the kitchen by the window so when you walk through the restaurant from their outside Japanese and Zen style garden, you can see the kitchen in action. And did I see a table inside the kitchen with a tall table and a couple stools that almost look like chef's tasting table? It almost felt like where the bosses were taking the cubicles while the other employees get the window seating.It's on white and brown colours tone with very dim light. I forgot my better camera and had to heavily rely on my foodie friend's flash camera phone.We were told all dishes were about 3 ounces to accommodate more different dishes. As a result, there seemed to have a lot of dishes ordered.The amuse bouche was a refreshing green apple popping.The monk fish liver was pate style and very refined. That toast I supposed was eaten as a chaser if you do not like the strong fishy taste.The soup was where they poured it onto the daikon and other micro-bite size vegetables which created like a pond. Tasted okay and it reminded me cream of mushroom.The rigatoni with oxtail and sea cucumber and fungi was really the highlight of all dishes with very rich and round taste. The pasta was cooked to perfection (slightly chewy without getting soggy.) The oxtail sauce was fantastic and lingers with you for quite some time afterwards.The pre sale lamb was very good too with edges cooked and center pink, more of a medium rare. The beef rib was fairly good firm and juicy style. The sauce was rich.We also had a half bottle Chateauneuf-de-Pape which was only double priced of the full bottle and was pretty reasonably priced.For dessert we had the chocolate garnache, paired with Maidera and 20 year Tawny. All were good but nothing mindblowing.They provided a little box of chocolates at the end which were very delicious and rich.Overall the food was good but not quite makes you dream of it. Many of these dishes might make you guess if you should eat with the few dots of sauce, as a chaser, or was it was meant to be a garnish. The 2 meat dishes were served with non-steak knives. Generally I understand the meat is easy enough to cut through when it is cooked to medium rare. I do think a steak knife would serve better to only need 1 sharp cut without effort than to saw it through a couple times. It's a way to not ruin the meat, especially with these bite size delicate.Service was fairly good and yes it's on a slower pace so you will have ample time to settle your palate in between dishes., Summary: Great meal at Benu Saturday night. Excellent, friendly, warm service and innovative dishes. Highly recommended.We enjoyed every course on the tasting menu, but I'm not going to go through each dish. Others have done a better job below. Two dishes truly stood out. First, the sea urchin 'dumpling' with sparkling grape foam was an incredible mix of texture and flavors. The foam was almost like a pop-rocks experience in the mouth matched with the smooth urchin and dumpling. Then bring in the salty intense flavors of the sea. Very innovative and unlike any other dish we've ever had.The second course that stood out was the Beef Tip with pine needle honey and pear. Perfectly done piece of meat with a deep beef flavor. But more serendipitous, was the music that came on as we enjoyed the dish: Led Zeppelin's All My Love. Perfectly matched with the course. ;)Some have called the room cold and sterile. For us, the temperature was a little chilly, but not overly so. The room is modern, clean, and comfortable with minimal extras (a few art pieces, no candles or superfluous decorations on the table). The attention to detail in the room matches the food and service. The design of the table matches the serving trays. The covers for the truffle dishes has a painting of a black and white truffle. The stand for the mountain yam and shrimp souffld9 and the box for the chocolate mignardises has the Benu logo engraved. These little touches throughout the meal were impressive.Lastly, I have to highlight the incredible service we received from Todd, Yoon and the entire Benu team. From the minute we walked up to the gate at the sidewalk (where we were met by an umbrella carrying guide to the slightly hidden door) to deliver and description of each course to our departure, the service was impeccable. Friendly, engaging, honest, knowledgeable and warm.We've enjoyed Corey Lee's meals in the past. Now on his own, it is clear he has built on these experiences and created an innovative menu with a great team of people. We will be back to enjoy Benu again and again., 'Well-deserved Hype. From what Ie read about Chef Corey Lee, he is extremely talented and humble; not one to seek the celebrity chef limelight. Whether he likes it or not, with the opening of Benu, he is a culinary superstar.During our recent dinner at Benu, there were girl groupies and diners all vying for a kitchen tour, a photo, an autograph. The recognition is well deserved. This dining experience was the most memorable Ie had in San Francisco in a long time and although I have been to French Laundry, this experience is uniquely different. Chef Lee marries exotic Asian ingredients with classical French techniques and preparation. I heard there is a long wait but somehow we managed to get a 7:30 dinner reservation on the same day. Nice. The decor is minimalist. No candles, no tablecloths, no artwork. Bare white walls and round columns envelope the dining area. It is clear that the subtle design was meant to showcase the food. However, I really think they should have used a lighting consultant because it wasn very flattering on the face or the food.Expect to order 4 courses (because the portions are small) or do the full tasting menu. We got the 4 courses and spent about $275 total.  First Course: Monkfish liver torchon, apple relish, turnip, ramps, sorrel, mustard, brioche ($16)  Pan-fried abalone served with a grenobloise sauce, cauliflower bits, caper and lemon. Both dishes were delicious, well thought out, and superbly executed and plated.Second Course: Carnaroli risotto, sea urchin, corn, lovage, black truffle ($22) This fatty, creamy plate was luxurious and decadent. Well worth the 45 min run the next day. SO MEMORABLE. I kept on talking about it for days.  semolina rigatoni, sea cucumber, oxtail, wood ear mushrooms,star anise, red wine, butter ($18) The mushroom sauce added some very strong flavor and the wood ear made for interesting texture.Third Course: Dry-aged prd9 sald9 lamb rack, garlic sausage, potato confit, chanterelles, lemon peel, coastal succulents ($30) was an excellent dish with a perfect level of saltiness. Fourth Course Soft chocolate ganache, feuille de brick, banana ice cream, Bourbon caramel, ginger jam and gelee ($14). This was a dessert that kept on giving. So many wonderful layers of flavors.The service is what I would expect from a fine dining establishment and they delivered. The valet parking is $15 bucks. Remember to give your valet notice about 10 min before you are about to leave because it takes them forever to pull up your car. I waited nearly 25 min for my vehicle.', More of a 3.5 star establishment, but given the exceptionally high-price I decided to round down as I was not wowed. When you drop $300+ a person on dinner/drinks, you expect a culinary experience and not just a good meal.I felt a little underwhelmed by Benu's 9 course tasting menu. Sure the food was mostly delicious and very elegantly presented, but it wasn't entirely memorable. There was not one dish that I would tell a friend that they must have. Highlights included the thousand old quail egg, and trio of fried eel, shrimp souffld9, and a salad of caramelized anchovies. The abalone dish was over fried and too bland. Sadly there is no comparison between this place and the French Laundry (where the head chef came from). The service was also a bit hit or miss. We had an assortment of waiters serving the 3 of us, some clearly excellent and well trained/informed, the others not so much. If we weren't paying what we did, I wouldn't have minded the service. But at that price point you expect not to be served but to be wowed. There were too many small mistakes like serving sparkling water when I asked for still, or waiting too long for the sommelier to come by and recommend wines. or requesting a tasting menu without sea urchin and having sea urchin appear on the custom menu (they rectified that issue).One unique dish we had was the Poularde de Bresse En Vessie (which literally is a chicken cooked in a pig's bladder). Sure enough, one of our many waiters brought out a roasting pan with the ballooned up bladder for us to see (see my photos for Benu). While it sounds a bit disgusting, it actually was some of the most succulent flavorful chicken i've had in a while. I would suggest trying it as it is a unique experience. I'm glad I went to Benu, but honestly it is not worth the hype---I've had much better dining experiences at that price point., 'Having been hailed as the most anticipated restaurant opening in San Francisco in 2010, Benu delivers succulent tastes, an invigorating atmosphere and sophistication to the Bay Area. From the visionary mind of owner and chef, Corey Lee, Benu hopes to breathe new life into the fine dining experience. From the custom designed porcelain plates, to the carefully selected wine list and perfectly plated progressive American Cuisine, no detail is overlooked.Pass through the tranquil courtyard and large wooden door into an airy, streamlined room with high ceilings, crisp ivory walls, lavish charcoal suede chairs, and glossy black tables. Diners are invited to revel in the ten to fourteen course prix-fixe meal, which includes inspired and seasonal bites such as: mountain yam with bottarga, lime, radish and perilla; veal sweetbread grenobloise with cauliflower, parsley, lemon and capers; and pork belly with sautd9ed lettuce, onions, spiced sugar, cherry and black olive sauce. For those looking for a more intimate selection, an a la carte menu is available with dishes like lobster bouillon with bd9arnaise custard, peas, carrots and tarragon or dry-aged prd9 sald9 lamb rack with garlic sausage, potatoes, lemon peel and coastal succulents.With its plush ambience, well-executed and tantalizing dishes, and what has been described as impeccable service, Benu is in a class of its own. This restaurant truly brings new meaning to the term modern fine dining.', 'Benu is the Oscar favorite this year in SF. It one part French Laundry, one part Momofuku, one part ... Jerry Bruckheimer. While it very ambitious the, uh, special effects cover up some unforced errors that left me disappointed.The basic problem is seasoning, but there are other issues. I didn love anything I had. My favorite course was the cigarette I had after I left the building.Abalone is somewhat overcooked for my taste and definitely over-salty, with small bits of unlovely cauliflower hanging out like vagrants. For the record I think, by comparison, Coi abalone is usually undercooked (translucent), and Plumed Horse in Saratoga does it jussssttt right.Celery with chestnuts course is actually kind of an old standard; it pretty nicely executed.There this chawan-mushi style dish with matsutake, foie gras, crab. The broth is knock-your-socks-off salty. I define too salty as the predominant taste is salt, to the point of having an astringent bite. Having said that, it actually quite delicious taken as a whole. But youe not getting the whole in every bite.Monkfish liver torchon is really nice, worthy of praise, and the brioche is perfect. Would I crave it? No. It monkfish liver, not foie gras. Nuff said. Pasta. There really nicely made squid-ink rigatoni, some of the best Ie had, but the whole dish reads flat because it sausage with, well, not much else except a creamy mush at the bottom. I think spicy, salty sausage demands at least some acid, but there none to be found here. So you get big creamy bites of rigatoni and ... salt.Risotto with uni is actually perfect; no complaints, really great.Sea bass stuffed with shrimp. Here I have to be indulgently political. I love sous vide. It revolutionary. For home cooks, that is -- I hope and pray that in ten years sous vide will supplant the crock pot because of its precision and efficiency. But for high end food, it time to mix things up. Fish should have crispy skin; sea bass doesn need shrimp inside it. And again, too much salt and no acid anywhere on the plate for balance. The xo jiang sauce is very nice.Sea cucumber with pork belly is nicely balanced but, honestly, to me it just Chinese comfort food. It ballsy to put it on the menu of a high end restaurant and props for that. But it doesn blow me away.The duck is heavily cured and stuffed and cooked sous vide. It a little like duck bacon. The sauce underneath is cloyingly sweet. Again, little acid, no balance.Deer wrapped in bacon is nice. I do have an issue with the fact that a dish advertises brussel sprouts and has one, two, three, four ... five little leaves. But I digress. I did really like this course.Dessert is chocolate ganache with crispy layers and banana ice cream. Very good.Overall I have a hard time recommending this place to my friends. It not as refined as, say, Coi; it doesn have the anchor in familiar flavors that the French Laundry does; there are real problems with seasoning and balance, and -- most of all -- it very expensive for all that. I can give more stars to a place that costs a car payment, and doesn give me numerous orgasmic moments.I kinda wish Corey Lee had pulled a David Chang and gone a little downmarket instead. He has a lot to offer. But this one won make it on my list of favorites. Your mileage may vary; chacun a son gout as they (well, Tim Gunn, at least) say.Finally, I be remiss if I didn mention that the service is excellent and the space is immaculate. Cheers.', Fantastic. I won't go through each dish, but I will say that on the whole, the tasting menu provided a wonderful experience. The food hearkened traditional home-style Asian flavors (skewing to the Korean/Japanese side of things) while utilizing exciting techniques and some surprising ingredients. The service was top-notch, and the sommelier was GREAT. The wines really were stellar, and I heartily recommend the wine pairing.Being a dessert fan, I was a little disappointed after the savory courses were done.All-in-all, I'll be happy to return here, but this time to try some of the dishes a la carte.Highly recommended., 'Is it just me, or is it just absurdly dd9classd9/obnoxious to constantly take pictures of your food in a fine-dining restaurant with a super serious high end camera? Because this was the main distraction all throughout my meal at Benu...the table across from us persistently photographing their food for 3 hours. Can you scream I A YELPER AND CAN WAIT TO POST THESE ON YELP!!!! any louder?? End rant.Other than that, I sum up Benu as:1. The food: quality, serious fine dining. The food is no joke here. 2. The ambiance: non-existent. Everything is beige, and it is eerily quiet.We could tell that the place is a well oiled machine, and a great deal of thought and preperation goes into everything. I don think it will be on my favorites list, but I glad I tried it. Get ready to spend mega bucks for small portions, take note. 3.5'|3
12|blackbird-chicago|'A certain former Smashing Pumpkin and I share the same birthday. One year it seems we both decided to celebrate at Blackbird. He was up in the private dining room, and I was down with the proles, but I assume we both enjoyed this place immensely. I had the duck and it was divine. Expensive -- but you get some gorgeous food for the price. The service is excellent. The tables are close together, thwarting plotting and risque gossip so you are left to meditate over the white-on-white design and mull over who really broke up the band.', This is a great place to go if you want to impress out of town friends or spend a ton of money on a small amount of food. I can appreciate that it is a fancy place, but it didn't stick out to me, i've had this same food at 20 other places in the city. However we did take friends from Dallas there, and they loved it, it just gave them that City Vibe that Chicago has., Blackbird was hot stuff when it started up, and it's certainly good enough quality to stay around. However, for the price, there's other places that have more interesting food and better ambience., The seasonal dishes are always amazing - sometimes, I wish that they'd just keep them on their menu. My first time here, I had this combination of quail breast and oyster mushrooms topped off with a blackberry float and tarragon ice cream. Amazing - also, keep in mind that they are closed on Sundays., 'So on my most recent trip to Boston I had a four hour layover in Chicago from 11-3. I think to myself, do I have time to hop in cab, eat lunch at Blackbird, and then get back to the airport. Maybe, but its worth the risk. The food here is freaking great. They are deft with the balancing hand and use primo delicious local and organic ingrediants I cant wait to go back. A++++', 'Dined here last night and this was my second time.. It just keeps getting better. Great service, probably the best in Chicago...Food was excellent as this is truly a must stop in the west loop.', 'You know a place is fancy when on the menu it reads Server attire designed by.....I really love the food at Blackbird. It fancy, strange, creative, and delicious. I have never had better gourmet in Chicago. The food is mostly organic and full of flavor. The menu changes often so its worth lots of return trips.My only beef with Blackbird is that I haven ever felt truly comfortable here. The wait staff is snobby and inattentive. They look you up and down when you come in and almost always decide you aren worth their time. The other problem is that the tables are hella close together. You can have a decent conversation with anyone here and you end up just smiling and whispering a lot. If you feel like dressy up in your awesomest fancy clothes and eating amazing food you should definitely come to Blackbird. Oh yeah, make sure you have at least $50 to spend if you want to do it right.** If its warm enough I recommend sitting outside. The sounds of the city muffle your conversation enough so that you can actually speak candidly.', can something be too refined? every time i have been there i really just want one of the waiters to drop a glass or swear or something so that i can see yes, they are human. i don't like that my dining experience is contingent on who is sitting next to me. which each time has been coked out partiers or arguing couple. the food is exquisite despite all of this., 'This is probably one of my personal favorite restaurants in the city. Paul Kahan is a genius. The flavors are delicate, yet exquisitely balanced. Sadly (and gladly), the menu changes quite frequently, so many of the dishes I have greatly enjoyed in the past are no longer there (only to be replaced by new ones). Be sure to book reservations at least 2 weeks ahead if you want to dine on a Friday or Saturday--after 7 years in business this place still gets completely booked on weekends. Hint: Lunch is a cheaper, but equally delicious option.', 'Perfect preperation, delicious and unbeatable.', 'We were visiting and some of our local friends decided to take us here for dinner. The food was amazing. One ordered the rabbit (rabbit breast and fried rabbit leg). He couldn stop raving all weekend about the kentucky fried rabbit.The service was fantastic and friendly (being that we were dressed all SF casual). And the dessert I had? The biggest yummiest raspberries imaginable served with -- get this -- balsamic marshmallows. Just give me a big olecup of those and Il be happy. Wait. I already was happy.', We had our first Blackbird visit this past Saturday and it was excellent overall. Minimalist dining room - white walls and white artwork with yellow daisies juxtaposed on every table. The view of the room from my seat was simple and cool - I turned around to get Andy's perspective and it was stark and downright cold - like florescent lights on a depressed clown, so consider your sensitivity to your surrounding before you reserve. Tables are efficiently spaced, maybe six or seven inches apart, and you may be subject to rehashed political arguments at the table next to you. Despite this, I was comfortable. The service was great. The waitstaff navigate the close quarters with intent faces, ever anticipating the needs of their patrons, always making excellent recommendations and displaying businesslike concern. From the hostesses and waitstaff to the sommelier, they didn't miss a beat the entire night. The food was incredible. The best scallops I've ever had! Pan seared and topped with shaved apples and champagne grapes. For the entree I got the potato & vegetable turnovers - delicious and not too filling. Andy had venison - very tender. But my favorite taste of the night was the graham cracker ice cream...to the Blackbird pastry chef: I would do just about anything for another spoonful., stark, pretentious, and overpriced. Other than that nothing about this place jumped out at me, including the food. The food was good, but I don't think it was worth the raves it has gotten. It might be good for a business lunch if you want to impress clients with an expensive meal. The service was impeccable but cold, and I'd rather have someone a little sloppy but who wasn't a pretentious ass and instead made me feel welcome. I would definitely NOT recommend for a date, its so minimalist and has no character, and the tables are so close together- I'd be itching to leave! Its not the kind of place you want to linger over your meal at all., 'The food was creative and very well prepared. Presentation was outstanding. The scallops appetizer was especially good, perfectly seared and deliciously seasoned. The venison was farm-raised, so it lacked some of the gaminess that you normally might expect.The wait for our orders was a bit long and the seating is a bit cramped. Price-wise, Blackbird is definitely a once-in-a-while place. However the overall experience was very good.', Clean modern look on the inside (all white). They match their black/white napkins to your clothing (I was told by who I was dining with that that is a sign of a good restaurant). If you're a vegetarian, I'd say steer clear of this place. There's about one option you can take. It's really tasty but the real good meals are for the carnivores. The food come in small portions. Excellent presentation. The deserts are all very unique and tasty. My party sampled one of each. I remember us really liking the peanut butter and jelly thing. I could be wrong. Whatever, it was dessert, it was sweet and yummy!They have really great wines. We bought 3 different bottles that evening. Thank god that tab was on my company that evening...The waitstaff is pretty snobby. Maybe they feel they have the right...who knows. It can get pretty crowded. Definitely not a place for an intimate date., It's loud, pretentious and too plastic-mod-ish. The service was slow and lacking, and the dishes are really hit or miss. Loved my appetizer, disliked everyone's main dish in my party., Great tasting food, but it's very fatty. I went for lunch when the prices aren't as outrageous and got a very large serving of whitefish sandwich, chips, homemade potato salad, and olives for $10. The service is good and the atmosphere is trendy, but the environment isn't nearly as bad as some people who wrote reviews are making it out to be. It seems that everyone in there is enjoying their meal and having a good time, so it's a bit louder than your run of the mill pretentious upscale place, but it's not out of control., special food with treats from the chef. yes the tables are so close together you feel like you may be in manhattan but get over it. unless you are in the cia, what could you possibly have to say that anyone else cares about. we had light frisee salads, fresh ravioli, chef's treats which wouldn't be on the menu anyway, and yummy creme brule., I ate here on 1/11/07. The food was spectacular. I love the use of fresh, local, in season ingredients. I had the sturgeon and oxtail. The presentation was flawless, food was fresh and very tasty. The combination of flavors was unique and appealing.Dessert was uninspiring, my group and I shared 4 of them. None of the 4 were standouts, or anything great for that matter. Dessert was a waste but the rest of the food is excellent, definitely worth coming back for.The minimalist, white-wall-black-napkin thing was a bit overdone. I can't tell you how sick and tired I am of minimalist decor. It did not work for this place at all... they definitely need a splash of color. Also, I agree with the others here the tables are far too close together. If I wanted a New York City dining experience I would go there, this is Chicago we have the room so use it. Stop cramming them in like cattle. It can be a bit difficult to have a conversation here because of the noise. Do not bring your older, hard-of-hearing family members here! At times the wait staff can be very snobby but they did soften up quite a bit once the dining room calmed down.I highly recommend the food here, which explains the 4 stars. If you are looking for the complete experience you may be disappointed. Definitely a must for foodies!, 'This has the best sandwich that I have ever had in my life. I am surprised that I only had to pay $10 as it is worth so much more...seared whitefish sandwich with lemon and herb aioli, gribiche,roasted tomato and homemade potato salad $10.And my lunch date had pork which he said was fantastic as well!organic pork belly sandwich with cabbage salw, dijonnaise, summer vegetable salad and garlic frites $13.', I forget how innovative and exciting Blackbird is.The flavors here are well-balanced, but not at all delicate--they're smoky, savory, and bolder than many other comparable restaurants. You can try transcendant preparations of pork belly, or quail, or venison. The tastes are not delicate and fussy; instead, they're quietly assertive, like they've been prepared by the kitchen of an infinitely refined country house owned by an obsessed foodie. The low point of this restaurant, for me, is the traditionally squashy bistro-style seating. The dining room is noisy and the tables are packed together. It's traditional bistro-style be-friends-with-your-neighbors style seating--not great for intimate private moments. Even overlooking the close-packed quarters, the room is rather minimalist and unexciting (I don't mind this, since I don't chose restaurants for their decor.)I have always found the service professional and efficient, and particularly good at suggesting wines to pair with courses. Servers take the not-there style of service, where they don't exhude any real personality and just focus on doing their jobs efficiently. They're not dazzling, but I am always perfectly happy with them and surprised how much they unobtrusively contribute to a great meal., yumIEEEI thought I didn't like mushrooms and squash until I went to Blackbird and it made me question all of my food dislikes. I feel like a five-year old who only liked chicken nuggets who suddenly discovers a whole new universe of food.Yes, minimalist experience. Extraordinary you-never-noticed-they-were-there-until-you-needed-them unpretentious service.I ordered the cheese salad and a fish with mushrooms and squash that were both exceptional. But there was special attention paid to every food matching so the end result was unexpected and well-rounded.We had the cheese plate to finish things off and each cheese came with a complementary fruit/nut pairing.Wine list was comprehensive, but friendly and had a lot of reasonably priced wines that you aren't likely to find intimidating.The tables are too close together. Aside from that, the only disappointment was that I hadn't found this place sooner.Four stars only because I didn't love the space and how squished in everyone was., 'I sort of work in the culinary industry, and it my job to sort of know what the trends are in food, and etc. I been advised to go to blackbird, for an affordable but contemporary art food  meal- as i cant really afford moto just yet. My boyfriend made reservations for 9pm, Thursday night the day before- so i dont believe there is too hard of a wait. The space is minimalist, but it is also very dynamic. I love white on white with a splash of color. The service is very very good- but it does not compare to the food. The dishes were excellently prepared, the chef is a james beard chef- which is the highest level of recognization for chefs. For a 9pm reservation- they were already out of the rabbit when we tried to order it, so perhaps if you are going there late, call and reserve specials. The tables are close together, but if you have good company, that doesnt matter!', Way overpriced. Dishes were nicely presented but don't go here if you want a hearty meal. Entrees are appetizer portions. Eating here is like eating at the contemporary art museum., 'love love love blackbird. one of my top choices in the city. The decor is ridiculously minimalist...almost as if to say, focus on our quality food. Its the same layout as its brother, Avec which is next door, but fancier. Great atmosphere, a small amt of outdoor tables in the summer. It is small, not a ton of room and you are seated close to your dining neighbors...but it adds to the experienceMake sure to get the poached egg salad...amazing. Fish is great here, as are their meat dishes. I would dress up to go here, most people are, and heels sound great on the hardwood floor! Good date place.', 'Blackbird is one of my favorite restaurants but I have had mediocre service from them from time to time and it gets REALLY LOUD when the place fills up. Still, the food is amazing and although its not quite on par with the level of Allinea, Everest, Avenues, etc. its still a mind-blowing culinary experience.For appetizers, the crispy, suckling pig is outstanding and if you can get it, the foie gras special seared on toasted brioche with huckleberry compote, crushed pistachios and bittersweet chocolate & red wine sauce is not to be missed.For entrees, I am partial to whatever they are doing with game birds and as of the last visit, it was a roasted quail with gingerbread stuffing, salsify and baby Brussels sproutsDessert is always a treat here. The dense Chocolate Marquise with whole milk ice cream is not to be missed if you are a chocolate lover.All in all this if you love food and you live in Chicago you should come here at least once.', 'Donnie, Donnie, Donnie... one of the coolest cats in Chicago.This man has reaked of style long before Chicago knew what it was or had to boast about having it. Anyway, Blackbird is a tough nut to crack for me, because as far as food goes - they definately know how to put the Mmmm... in your mouth. But the overall experience - I find to be one sided.One of the top restaurants in the city for gastronomia. This chef prepares food for the most discerning and/or bitchyest crowd in city. EVERYONE feels the need to pick apart this place - Why? -beacuase yes, it is very minimalist, yes the staff can give you the once over (some people enjoy flaunting their tailor-isms), and yes it can feel quite simply - cold. But notice that despite these (self inflicted) facts- Blackbird STILL is on top of it game and is a very successful restaurant with many fans.Honestly- I can deal with all the pageantry that accompanies the place, but for my personal pocketbook, I prefer a bit more warmth. But clearly, I am just a bit fuZZy that way. Excellent food- period.', 'I don know what so great about this place. One word: OVERRATED.Ie been there twice for business lunches - once when it first opened and once a couple months ago - and I have yet to experience the wonder that is Blackbird. I got the only thing that looked even slightly appealing on the lunch menu, the croque monsieur, and it wasn even that good.Maybe I not foodie enough for this place, but it is definitely not worth the cash youe going to lay out.', For being so laid back, Paul's skills are intense. Award winning chef has sophisticated palate; bring yours. The level of cuisine is excellent and adventurous. Well executed., Wow! We were in Chicago for a wedding, but the ulterior motive was food. Being from San Francisco, we did not take this lightly. We did a fair amount of chowhound research and as well as talking friends from Chicago. All signs pointed to Blackbird (Trotter's and Alinea were excluded because we needed money to eat Chicago steak for the rest of weekend!), and, boy, did the signs not disappoint. Fantastic dining experience. It's a small, hip interior that disposes of much of the pomp that would be its due given the quality of the food. The cuisine is French-inspired American bistro. The menu is one hit after another. The sweatbreads were succulent, the lardons frisee had a great presentation, the sliced veal delivered and the grand slam of the evening, the porkbelly, sent us over the top. Crazy good. The front of house staff was excellent. They comped us our first two glasses of wine at the bar for waiting a measly 15 minutes for our table. Our waiter used our feedback and menu selections to recommend a fantastic wine that a major hit with the wife (very important). Can't say enough about this place. For those of you in San Francisco looking for a restaurant comparison, the best we can come up with is a slightly better Delfina - just swap the Italian inspiration for French and add 10 years to the age of the waiters (and subtract the tattoos, too), I had been to Blackbird once before and was not terribly impressed, but I have to admit that my last turn in the 'Bird was exceptional. The front of the house was excellent. Low pressure, but full of information.The food was outstanding. I had the suckling pig appetizer which ranked as the third best pork dish that I have ever had (after Maurice's BBQ in Columbia, SC and pork back that I had in Pienza, Italy). Then I moved on to the Croque Madaam. Tremendous, but skip the frities. We finished off with the Meyer Lemon Tart with Shaved Fennel and Citrus. Unreal.If I would have reordered, I would have skipped the Croque, but you can't hit them all. Great dining experience and I will be back., Despite the Zagat rating, I just am not getting on the Blackbird train. Don't get me wrong, it's not BAD per se - I get the techno minimalist decor and the posh location. I'll even give you that the Croque Monsieur is damn good. However, every other thing I've had there was trying so hard to be cuisine they forgot to make it taste good.Also, slow service and a pain to get reservations - I have never in my life not been able to get a LUNCH reservation at my initial requested time., I thought my 100th review should be of a place that really blew me away and this is Blackbird. I came here about a month ago on a Friday for lunch. I was seated immediately without a reservation and really fell in love with the space.It is one big open room with a bar against the wall near the entrance. Everything is super stream-lined and I like that they didn't go over the top minimalist (as seemingly strange as that sounds). I was greeted with water and bread with a sort of seasoned butter. There were bits of what I decided were rosemary and fennel and it was only exceptional when I scraped these butter bits off and slathered them on my bread. Otherwise it was nothing to write home about. I started with the confit of suckling pig with chiogga beets, watercress, and sauted bitter greens. I paired this appetizer with a MacRostie Pinot Noir. This was a match made in heaven. It was basically a pulled pork in the most fragrant and rich broth imaginable. I took piece after piece of pork, soaking it in the sauce and using the bitter greens to cut the richness. Then sipping the wine melded it all together. It was heaven!I then ordered the California Sturgeon with cabbage and grapefruit over some kind of cream sauce. This was paired with a Chateau de Fontaine Audon Sancerre. It was fruity and crisp and cut the cream from the sauce. The sturgeon was absolutely incredible. Every bite I took tasted like the sea...there is no better way it could have been. The cabbage was like a kraut which made the grapefruit really sing. I was so happy at this point that dessert was a necessity. I didn't want this lunch to end. I ordered the buckwheat crepaze with a rhubarb consomm and pistachio ice cream. It was topped with candied celery that I could have eaten handfuls of. I loved it as much as everything else I had that day and will always keep this meal in a special place to recall on those occasions when I am away from Chicago. I will make sure to come for dinner at least once before I leave for Seattle. Blackbird really is a high mark in the Chicago dining scene., Recently celebrated with my boyfriend at this fine Chicago restaurant. Everything was superb, which considering how much our meal was, it should have been. Excellent wine list, even if they were a bit overpriced. Great place to celebrate something special, but it's not particularly romantic. In fact the couple next to us had a two year old int tow, but we ignored it. We were determined to enjoy the evening. We stopped at the Tasting Room, also on Randolph, after our dinner and I would suggest it if you are looking for a nice after dinner wine or port. Service at both were excellent and friendly., Three and a half stars, though if I had ordered my friend's entree and stuck with my dessert, I'd give it four.I am quickly ramping up on the Chicago restaurant scene with a lesson in names and faces on the local culinary circuit. At Blackbird, I've managed to acquaint myself with the cooking of Chef de Cuisine Mike Sheerin, who came from WD-50, NYC's answer to molecular gastronomy.So you ask, what business does a food alchemist have in a seasonally-driven kitchen such as that of Blackbird's? Well a whole a lot, now that Chef Paul Kahan is busy working on a new restaurant. The idea is that Sheerin preserves the integrity of Blackbird by offering a new perspective on how to prepare seasonal food.The amuse for the night was a watermelon salad, which seems to be a popular ingredient for summertime. It was nice and light, though typical for a watermelon preparation.Our waitress introduced the Grilled California Sturgeon ($30) as a fish dish for meat lovers. The firm flesh of the sturgeon held up well against the plank grilling, which gave it the texture of pork tenderloin and the flavor of smoked meat. While I found the fish a bit dry, I couldn't keep from devouring the rye gnocchi and guanciale, which was the equivalent of rye mash potatoes (sans the potato) perfumed by lemony, herbaceous caraway seeds. Perhaps it was the guanciale or the oyster mushrooms or simply just a heavy hand, but I found the dish a little on the salty side.I was looking to end my meal on a on light note, so I skeptically chose the Buckwheat Crepaze ($10), which is essentially a torte decked with layer upon layer of thin crepe batter. You could definitely taste the buckwheat with the candied celery, pistachio ice cream, and rhubarb consomme keeping the flavors of the dish bright. The spongy texture of the Crepaze was perfect for soaking up the rhubard consomme and melted pistachio ice cream.I also had a chance to try the Venison ($34) and Milk Chocolate Cremeaux($10) dessert. I only had one bite of the venison and all I have to say is that it was stellar. Cooked medium rare, the presentation was beautiful and the flavor profile, incredibly light considering the heaviness of the meat.I've never been a fan of spiced chocolate, so I mostly stayed away from the Milk Chocolate Cremeaux, which came with a coconut-curry ice cream. Salty-sweet combinations are a trend in Chicago restaurant scene, but the custard, ice cream, cashew, and lime combination was too busy for my taste., 'frigging phenomenal. delux with seven or eight x. bartender thought my girlfriend and i were chicago industry, which i always take as a compliment. order anything. go anytime. thank me later.', Good, but not knock your socks off. Really just three and a half stars. The food is decent and tries to be inventive, but it really just didn't execute as well as I hoped. The highlight for us was the '86 Smith Woodhouse Single Year Tawny Colheita. Absolutely delicious.See a full review and photos of Blackbird and other Chicago restaurant reviews on Gastronomic Fight Club:gastronomicfightclub.com43_, This is the best meal I've had in Chicago. I had a pork belly dish that I still think about sometimes. It's been about 8 months and I need to give it another go. I understand the complaints about the noise, it is certainly tight quarters in there, but I had no problem conversing with my dining partner. Definitely go here., 'Oh yes it IS knock-your-socks-off-good! Awesome food, service, ambience. Easily one of my best meals in Chicago in 5 years. The best on the menu - braised octopus and suckling pig appetizers, california sturgeon and venison entrees were FABULOUS. The chocolate polenta dessert with olive oil ice cream was out of this world. Sweet, courteous, attentive waitstaff excelled. A pretty perfect evening.', 'Our meal at Blackbird was easily one of the top three meals Ie ever enjoyed in Chicago. Ie not been gone from the place for even 12 hours, yet here I sit, longing for another amazing endive, poached egg, pancetta and crispy potato salad. The presentation is surprising and lovely, the flavors comforting and lingering... I could eat that salad for breakfast, lunch and dinner and not tire of it. Justin thoroughly enjoyed his mussel soup with white fish--I was glad he was so interested in his dish that I did not have to share mine! We chatted with our wonderful server, David, about entrees and pairings from Blackbird extensive wine list--he was friendly, warm and knowledgeable and happy that I finally chose his favorite--the venison--for my entree. Cooked perfectly medium-rare, the dish was a wonderful mix of flavors and textures--the tender venison paired so well with the crunch of sugar snaps, the sweetness of black mission figs and the velvety texture of the bacon panisse. Fantastic. Justin had the roasted duck breast with honeydew melon and cucumber--once again, there was little sharing going on, which hardly mattered since we were both so enamored with our own selections... Justin passed on dessert but I had to try the buckwheat crepaze--layers of thin buckwheat crepes in a fresh, tart rhubarb consomme, with creamy pistachio ice cream and candied celery. I think if one could eat Spring, it would have those same wonderful, fresh flavors...Service was excellent. We were warmly greeted by the hostess, our server and his assistant; needs were anticipated, we were left to enjoy our meal at a leisurely pace and questions were answered honestly and thoroughly. We were seated at a two-top at the front of the house, next to the window with a great view of the outdoor diners and with ample room to move about. When another server seated a couple next to us, through the glass, Justin good-naturedly waved to them. They laughed and turned to me to mouth Happy birthday through the glass. When other servers are aware it my birthday and encourage their patrons to wish me as such, I feel extraordinarily well taken care of. It was a lovely gesture and a sweet surprise.I had wanted to visit Blackbird for *years* but for whatever reason, never made a reservation... I guess good things do come to those who wait... Hopefully I won have to wait too long for my next phenomenal meal there.', More like 3 1/2 stars . . . It was interesting. While the food was delicious it was all just a little too rich. I started out with the pinenut gazpacho and I finished about 3/4 of it and my tastebuds couldn't handle any more so I had to stop. The sturgeon was so rich I could only eat about 1/3. For dessert I tried the beignet with BACON ICE CREAM. Ok, that was it. I couldn't eat anymore. While the beignet was good, the bacon ice cream was just a step too far. It tasted like frozen bacon grease. It's hard to explain but I feel like the richness of the food overpowered the flavor. Everything was sort of overloading my taste buds but not in a good way. The service was excellent and the restaurant itself is clean & modern. It's just that the food itself feels like it's trying too hard., This was my third visit to Blackbird and I have to say this is one of the best restaurants in Chicago if not one of the top 20 I've ever eaten at. I went with a group and we had the scallops, suckling pig, quail and tomato mozzarella salad as appetizers, all of which were great. For dinner we had venison which was amazing with figs and the two others had sturgeon and cobia which were the fish specials. The desserts were fantastic and the wine we had, helped out by a very knowledgeable sommelier, was amazing. I highly recommend this restaurant!!, 'So this is where I went for lunch today with hubby for my bday. Perfect. I love to eat at places where I cannot replicate the food at home. Here are just two examples of what we ate: crispy confit of of swan creek farm suckling pig with sour cherries, roasted chiogga beets, housemade prosciutto and local cress mission fig beignet with black raspberries, butterscotch and bacon ice creamThe pork dish, at first, I thought was too small (almost like a pate) and would only fill a molar, however, it was so rich with so many flavors it filled up my husband. The beignet dessert dish...wow...butterscotch was drizzled under the fruits and beignet and the beignet were shaped like mushrooms so it looked like a tree branch design. The biggest beignet was filled with warm fig/raspberries that turned out like a jam. And the bacon icecream! Who would have figured to do that? Yes, it tasted like bacon at first and then went sweet like French Vanilla. Oh, and my husband ordered the soup of the day and get this- the ingredients included apples, juniper, eel, and hazelnuts. It was served as a broth with two pieces of eel. Can I tell you that it was delicious? It was kind of sweet with something tasting like nutmeg. The restaurant is very minimalist in style but the staff is very friendly. I am so happy we went there today.', Key Yelp: A fashion forward, sophisticated new American, French inspired dining experience. An occasion place for most. The food was surprisingly good, and better then the menu reads. A tad of attitude, but very well done. Review: Lets try a Q/A format-Why and when would you WANT TO DINE at Blackbird?-You want to eat in a sophisticated urban setting.-You feel adventurous.-You enjoy wine food pairings.-You want to taste ingredients, proteins and preparations you may not have had before.-You want to approximate a NYC new American dining experience.-You don't mind glances, smiles and brief exchanges and pleasantries with the tables next to you.-You crave a cheese course for dessert.-You love pork.When and why would you NOT WANT TO dine at Blackbird?-You want romance.-You don't want noise.-A little attitude makes you want to hit someone, hard.-You want privacy.-You are really hungry.-You want comfort food* *OK-I ate for the first time and maybe the last, pork belly, which was sublime....this is comfort food for the most indulgent only...it was a rare treat for me., We dined here for lunch last week while visiting Chicago. I am blown away by this restaurant. I had the blackbird bouillabaisse- which was fresh fish, mussels, calamari with fennel, potato, saffron, garlic, thyme and grilled bread. It was perfection--it was flavorful and big portion size. My boyfriend had organic pork belly sandwich with thegarlic frites, which was also excellent. For dessert we shared a mission fig beignet with black raspberries, butterscotch, bacon ice cream-- I was a little doubtful of the flavor combination but after a taste, I was speechless. The sweetness of the black raspberries, beignets meld well with the slight saltiness of the bacon. Service was on point--formal but not too stuffy and very friendly . (I realized SF service pales in comparison to Chicago's) . I also enjoyed the space, minimalist and great use of space.I enjoyed my weekend in Chicago--beautiful city, excellent food. I will definitely be back to this city and for sure at Blackbird (next time for dinner)., 'Update:I finally visited for the real deal with an out of town friend from California. I glad I made it out alive. See Susan Y. review for a narrative. As far as the food, it just perfectly executed and great ingredients. I ordered the berkshire blue cheese salad with treviso, seckle pears, blood orange and crispy artichokes as its still barely winter and I appreciate the winter ingredients. The blue cheese slices melted in my mouth and the lettuce was the perfect slightly warmed by the oil temperature where it all melded together perfectly. I had the vegetarian entree the roasted yellow split pea panisse with radicchio, smoked paprika ricotta, pickled hen of the woods mushrooms and pumpkin seeds. I wasn sure what to expect but it was a crunchier baked thing. It was amazing, though not all that much in quantity so I was glad to have gotten the salad and snagged bites of the short rib/steak and fish. With all this I had a glass of grappa, as per my brother recommendation from studying abroad in Italy. I was asked if I wanted it weetor asoline.I selected gasoline which I regretted rather quickly. Accustomed to the wine split of fruity and dry; I figured it would be along the same lines. Wrongitty wrong. Il try the sweeter grappa next time since I don really like what tasted to me like half Everclear half sake. Overall, pretentiousness took a star away initially but it earned it back after dealing with us well (assuming I am not blacklisted, though blacklisted from Blackbird has pretty good alliteration). First review about group event:Ie been waiting for awhile to eat at this glowing minimalist box and finally an opportunity arose and seize it I did. A postcard arrived in the mail from my alumni association; on the way to the paper shredder but wait... what does this say? Blackbird. Well that word is one bird that excites this food nerd. And so I was web registered for this private event upstairs in no time. Upon arrival I walked upstairs to the private event dining room. Tonight it was arranged without tables so as to be conducive to mingling. There were couches lining the walls. The well lit bar had the wine selections lined up and ready to pour. This was apparently a pairing according to the printed menu but it did not work out like that. The wine were mostly vintage 2004 from what I can remember. I stuck with mostly the Pinot Noir for 5 glasses and it was great. Servers with trays of tiny food cubes shuttled around throughout the night. The first I tried was a small bagel chip with some sort of salmon or crab mousse and a clover-like green on top. I also tried a cube of scallops and apparently foie gras (or some variation of). I normally may not have eaten this but by glass 3 of the wine and hunger having completely taken over along with the absolutely beautiful presentation well what the hell once you pop you can stop. The cube presentation was nice with all sorts of beautiful colors and even tinier cubes of jellies perched next the larger cube. Dessert, however, is where the small plates shined much brighter. The cookie-like cherry item was hot out of the oven and so perfectly executed I can imagine it done better. Then there were various small graham cracker like cookies with perfectly formed half spheres of smooth chocolate. I quickly moved around mingling and trying to head off different servers to snag a few more of these. Overall, I was extremely pleased with the wine and dessert and the other small items were good. Now, if it wasn all the size of something baked in an Easy Bake Oven it would probably do me a hell of a lot more good. Il be back for a real dinner though so Il reserve my final star until then...', This restaurant once offered a dessert that featured bacon. And it was insanely delicious. If that doesnt warrant 5 stars I dont know what would. 'Nuf said., Executive Chef Paul Kahan creates pretty amazing dishes. I never thought I'd enjoy crispy sweetbreads as much as I did. And the venison I had for my main was perfectly cooked and served with a bacon-ny sauce. My wife had the pork belly main with sauerkraut. Awesome, but not as good as the venison. Perfect wine pairing advice too. Overall outstanding service actually. The space is minimalist, but not off-putting. I really like eating here, and would do so more often if I made more money. There's the only rub. It's not that it's not worth the money, I just wish it was less., I'd been wanting to try Blackbird for awhile and was excited to finally come here. The menu is really creative and has some interesting food pairings. We had the scallops for an appetizer (yum) and I ordered the sturgeon for my entree. I had never had sturgeon before and I really only ordered it because it came with sauerkraut gnocchi and I was intrigued. The sturgeon was excellent - very flavorful and paired well with anjou pears on the side. And the gnocchi was really interesting (good for a side, but nothing more).Our server was super helpful (we sat at the bar so our server was actually the bartender). Not only did he refill my wine often, he also performed some magic tricks!The restaurant itself is nice, though small, and very chic. Minimalist, white. The crowd seemed a bit on the older side and I definitely felt underdressed in my jeans & sweater vest (I had come from work). Most people there were pretty dressy - or at least wearing all black (and this was a Thursday night). Overall, it was uniquely delicious dining experience., 'I have had an unusually circuitous route to Blackbird. It seems unusual to me anyway. I first came heard of it whilst at a Taste of Lincoln Park summer fair. On this particular afternoon and after sampling oodles of portions I came upon this slice of pork that literally jumped out. I kept saying I had to visit their restaurant. My plans were spoiled when I learned it was The Blackbird, so while the taste really lured me in, I simply couldn bring myself to admit to go to one of these amousrestaurants. Hey! I weird that way!Fast forward a couple of years and one Sunday afternoon I was seated at Hopleaf (oh yes, DO go there :-)) and was chatting with the barman and I was joined by a happy bunch of happy revelers. We talked Bears football. In 2006 - 2007 every time I watched the Bears live they would lose. It turns out the exec. chef of Blackbird had this kind of luck. So we chatted for a while and they left. The Hopleaf barman recognized the exec. chef but I remained clueless. When he brought this to my attention, I decided, that I liked them enough based on spending an hour or so talking with them and finding him unassuming.So I finally made my trip and regretted instantly why I never gave it a fair shake. Upon getting into Blackbird, I was shocked by how small *it looked*. I should have asked but surely there is more to the space than meets the eye. Our service was slow initially. We literally had the awkward 5 minutes after being settled and waiting for your server to show up. It was a busy night, so it was understandable. Not gonna knock on the place for this.Blackbird food is everything I expected it to be and MORE! I finally got to eat that braised pork that was still tattooed in my palate. You simply MUST try this. The Mrs. had sturgeon which was recommended by our extremely attentive server. Given the amount of time he spent with us, it is no wonder the service seemed slow to start.I will return but not frequently as it is a tad pricey.', I've been here for both lunch and dinner and can say that the experience was incredible both times. The staff is friendly and knowledgable about the menu and wines, and the scallops were amazing! The crowd is more upscale and sophisticated, but definitely not stuffy, and the decor is very clean and modern- it actually almost made me hungry! I would recommend this place for a business lunch sure to impress clients, or for a dinner date sure to impress any girl with taste!, from the execution to the presentation and most importantly to MY palate, everything is done superbly and professionally without a stuffy air of arrogance.where do they get the ingredients for their dishes? i'm thinking they have some sort of co-op connection with the garden of eden itself. kinda like my connection with binny's., Still one of my favorites after all these years. I have eaten at Blackbird countless times and spent many NYE's with them and I agree with almost every review on here....they are simply the best! They truly know how to keep people happy time and time again. If you didn't like it, it just wasn't meant for you and maybe you should go have a nice cold one, on tap, at McCooolgiansns in Wrigley-LakeView-Wisconsin.Food is unmatched for the price you pay.I love, love, love the room and the artwork. Nice Wine list.Staff has always been nice as far as I am concerned, I did have one bad experience with a hostess a few years back - but who is counting, really?I like coming here for lunch, a long lunch and having a glass of wine or two with my meal. I also really like the private dining room upstairs, if you have not been to the private dining room, it is worth considering for your next smaller sized upscale event.I especially love that you can see people at Blackbird that you don't see in most other restaurants/bars in the city. These people must live some place not in the Midwest OR they live here and take refuge in the safety of their own homes and only come out to go to Blackbird and perhaps the occasional art opening., 'Maybe the most enjoyable lunch I have ever had in the city. Great beer list. James Beard Award winning Chef Paul Kahan is the mastermind behind this gem. The ambiance and decor is very NYCish. A must try.', As I mentioned with Avec, this is not the place you would want to bring a first date. Very brightly lit! I think I could see the pores on my dates face! I had the altantic cod which was very good. I've heard the pork belly is good, although very unhealthy--oh aren't all good things!, in my top 5 of all time. the kindof menu that makes you want to return until you have tried everyting on it (though it does change around). the space is minimal with clean lines so it really doesn't feel as teeny (maybe 15 tables?) as it really is. the space and menu =simple and interesting, not stuffy or overdone.i tried two of the mainstays on the menu: the endive salad with poached egg for the first course and the pork belly for the main course. both were really unbeleivable, though my friends did say the pork belly was better on their previous visits. my pals let me sample their veal sweatbreads and the atlantic cod. the sweetbreads were really talked up by our server and i suppose they were good I just don't have anything to compare them to (or maybe i am just not as adventurous as I would like to think I am). the cod was perfect., Blackbird is a modern, trendy restaurant - without being pretentious. The service here is the best! Our waiter wasn't snobby at all; in fact, he was VERY friendly and attentive. He made us feel welcome and made sure that we had a great dining experience. I ordered the seabass and I loved it! However, I ordered the 'Pink, Pink, Pink' martini just for the name of it. Maybe I should've actually read the ingredients and not picked it based on the name. Whoops.All in all, we had a great experience. ;), 'Blackbird embraces De Stijl stark, white decor as if it were Piet Mondrian. The simplicity is very apparent in the decor, so as not to take focus off the food. The service was efficient, though never rushed. The tables are set in such a manner, that anyone may peer to their side to catch a glimpse out the window and this also prevents shadows from incoming light. The open air kitchen provided excellent culinary delights. The organic raised chicken was crisp and sweet on the outside and was flavorful and tender in. The chicken was served with quince, which was popular during roman times and is related to pears, and spigarello - which is sort of like kale - it is bitter and goes well with the green lentils that made this a perfect combination. Along with guanciale, nice fatty pig cheek, an undertone of salt added to the many flavors from what would seem a rather simple dish. The bouillabaisse was purported to be fresh and flavorful, yet became very salinic at the bottom according to the Velarde/Suan duo. Salinity is a factor which cannot be ignored. Yet, the overall experience was one we will remember.', AMAZING! Delicious plates that are thoughtfully paired and prepared, and great service. Although it can get a little loud, it's one of my favorite restaurants., My new favorite restaurant in the city, Blackbird was a delight from start to finish. My boy brought me here as a birthday treat and I'm still dreaming about the food two weeks later. First and foremost, the service is impeccable. Unobtrusive and yet always there, the staff seems to know exactly what you need at that moment. Case and point, the hostess noticed I had placed my purse on the floor rather than squish it behind me on my chair and she came right over with a nifty little silver hook that balanced my purse on the edge of the table. on top of that, not one person bumped into it the entire night. NOT ONE! Minimalist decor with an open kitchen, I had a great time watching what was going on; we had a two top next to the wall and despite the crowd, we had lovely conversation the entire night. On to the food. WOW. Just wow. Beautifully prepared and incredibly creative, I was both surprised and awed. To start, they offered us an amuse bouche of poached sturgeon over a fava bean mash with buttered radish. Delish. We ordered the diver scallops and suckling pig to start followed by the rabbit and atlantic cod. The scallop dish might have been the best thing i've ever eaten, period. I was reluctant to share it with my boy but it only seemed fair since I'd already eaten half his app. My cod was also outstanding, perfectly cooked with butternut squash miso, trumpet mushrooms, onions, and pancetta. The sauce accompanying the rabbit was to die for. Dessert might have been the only low point; it wasn't bad, in fact it was very good but just couldn't compare to dinner. The bill came with milk chocolate/sea salt caramels and handmade lychee gummies. WOAH.You must try this place. MUST. the wine list is great, lots of bottles in the $30-$50 range with half bottles too. great selection and very well edited. AND, there's a decent amount of street parking in the area so you can skip the valet.|1
13|boka-chicago|We visited this restaurant for a friend's birthday. The food was great and so was the atmosphere. Slightly upscale, but well worth it! This is definitely a great place for a special night on the town with your friends or sweetie. Try to go a little later in the evening; we had a 6:30 reservation and there were more senior citizens dining then when we left at 8:30, when the crowd became filled with more 20- and 30-somethings., 'Head to Boka for a fabulous dinner then go to Landmark right around the corner for drinks. The most fab seasonal dessert, pumpkin creme brulee. The food is pricey, but absolutely worth it. Show up later to see more of a crowd.', The food is delicious, but you have to deal with the snooty-ass staff. I thought about the meal that i ate there for days afterwards, it was so good, but I also couldn't get our rude waitress out of my head. I'd go back... but with reservations (no pun intended)., I love this place! I've only eaten at the bar so haven't had to experience the rude waitstaff, but the bartenders are great! The chestnut soup is fantastic (I know, sounds crazy), and you must try the gnocchi... AMAZING. The caesar was a little heavy on the dressing for my liking. Oh yes... and the chocolate cake... WOW (try this with a glass of the Klinker Zin (I think that's what it's called)), what a combo!!, The food is Delicious, and thats with a capital D. everything is just really fresh and really good. To add to the great food, they make a good drink and they have excellent service. They fill the water, replace napkins when someone gets up, they don't greab your plate away while you are still eating and the server really knew his stuff! Its a great place for a nice dinner., I've never eaten at Boka, although I hear it's pretty good. I have been here for drinks on a few occasions and think it's a great place if you want to get a table with your friends and chat. The last time I went here it was because the line was too long at landmark and I liked this atmosphere much more than landmark. I'll have to try the food to review it very soon., 'The atmosphere here is trendy, but the food is at best mediocre and the service was severely lacking. My pork was tough and tasteless, and my date was completely unimpressed with his dish as well. Cool place for drinks but eat elsewhere!', 'It would be tragic if Chicago lost this great of a restaurant.BOKA is a fabulous dining experience. I have come here for dinner as well as for a drink at the bar. Ie been very please with both the food as well as the service.There is an older crowd before/after the Steppenwolf begins/ends. Please do not let this deter you. It a wonderful dining experience, especially when on a date.', Jacky and I went to BoKa on Friday night, and we really enjoyed it. Somewhat embarrasingly, despite it being only blocks away, we had not eaten here since it was Don Pablo's. The main reason was that we usually went to Vinci, but no other logical reason after that. I have been traveling a lot these past couple weeks, and am -- quite frankly -- exhausted. We walked in early (we were going to a play), around 6, and there were three people hovering around the host stand (in a good way). They all had smiling faces, and were completely welcoming. After dealing with some TOUGH faces in multiple states for a stretch...it was a nice start. We walked past the beautiful atrium seating and outside (too humid), and were seated in the tables near the now smokeless bar area. Beautiful rich colors, cushioned arm chairs and stylish menus. I was already impressed with the decor, at least. The menu was a simple one-page affair, but with some tremendous items -- some great appetizer choices, oysters and 5 differents 'numbered' salads (salad #1, et al.). Jacky ordered the scallops: grilled with a lavender cream sauce, chanterelles, leeks and organic popcorn garnish. Unique, and very well done. I started with a trio if their three oysters, served with a champagne mignonette, and 'salad #5' -- a prosciutto and melon salad with hazelnuts, greens and balsamic. Absolutely tremendous. The salad was the highlight. I also started with a nice chilled Grey Goose martini (extra dry, natch) with a skewer of excellent blue cheese stuffed olives. Their wine list was phenomenal, and Iwas looking forward to selecting a glass for dinner. We noted that they are one of the few restaurants in Chicago serving Hanzell Vineyards wine...a Sonoma favorite, you must try their Chardonnay or Pinot Noir (all they make). While pricy, it is perhaps our favorite vineyard in America (Jacky is a Sonoma Cutrer girl, though), and they have been doing it since the late '50s. I digress -- the entrees -- Jacky had been drinking it up for a late afternoon business thing at BIN36, so she had actually been noshing all afternoon, so she stopped at the scallops. I was torn between some great-looking selections -- a nice vegetable laden risotto, a halibut, a salmon...but I decided on a pork tenderloin, done in a BBQ dry rub served with braised swiss chard and a corn succotash. It sounded great, and it was indeed a tremendous dish. In fact -- my only complaint was that the chard was bit too 'musty,' rather than simply a bitter green. I think it needed an extra rinse (like spinach), prior to cooking. Jacky was, however, in a dessert mood, and we couldn't pass up some tasty options -- Jacky had a chocolate creme brulee served with tiny chocolate chip cookies, and I had a twist on my favorite dessert of all time (lemon meringue pie). It was a lemon tart topped with a meringue and covered in a warm blueberry compote. Both were great desserts. Our service was excellent -- we had a very knowledgable server, and at one point -- I wanted to get that glass of wine I was looking forward to (a nice Malbec), and while glancing for our server, the manager spotted me, and made a nice beeline for me to ask what I would like. I told him, and within 2 min., our server deftly delivered my glass. All in all -- an efficient (thinking theatre) dinner, replete with excellent service, a calming atmosphere, great food, and a menu that will make me come back to try other options. To conclude -- I am still shaking my head that we hadn't been here before, but now that we have, we'll be back for sure., The decor and atmosphere of this place is really cool - its trendy, but comfortable. Unfortunately, things start to go downhill from here. The wine list is really disappointing for the size of it. The food sounds really good on the menu, but just doesn't deliver. The squash soup was too sweet, and my fish was bland and over cooked. I usually don't complain about chocolate cake, but it was so rich we could barely finish it., One of my new favorite spots in the city. Service was excellent and decor was amazing. It was modern and sleek yet still very comfortable. I found the wait staff to be impeccable and very friendly. The food was great, the fall soup was incredible, I'd go back for that alone. I had the duck which was very good. It was a little fatty, even for typicaly duck, but overall it was very good. The desert was great. I had the chocolate cake and was very impressed with it. Yes, it was rich, but thats not a complaint in my book.Overall I cannot wait to go back to this place. You can check, I don't give many 5 stars., 'I had been wanting to try Boka for a long time, especially because it seems to be one of the few fine dining restaurants in Lincoln Park, but I have to admit I was slightly disappointed when I finally went there. First off they didn have our reservation, even though I had called two weeks ahead of time. The hostess metioned that a lot of reservations had been lost that night, which I thought she should have kept to herself. Despite the fact that it was a Tuesday and the place was not at all crowded we had to wait at the bar for ten minutes before getting a table. The service seemed off all night. It took forever for someone to come greet us, get our drinks sent over from the bar and bring us water. The food was pretty good, but nothing to write home about, and the menu offerings were pretty limited. (Don be fooled by all the stuff they have listed on their website - only a fraction of that is actually on the menu.) Also, the interior of the restaurant was just not attractive. There seemed to be other rooms that were not open, perhaps because it was a Tuesday night and they were a little slow, so they might have been a little more appealing to the eye, but Il never know because I won be back here.If youe looking for a restaurant in this part of town I would definitely skip Boka and go their sister restaurant, Landmark, which is just down the street.', Great experience! The staff was thoughtful, the waitstaff was attentive and prompt, the interior was super cool, and the food was amazing. They do a small plate/large plate dinner option which may have you looking at the silly clipboard menus a bit longer than you should. Don't worry small plates are really 'appetizers' and large plates are 'entrees'. Once we got the translation we were good to go with delicious scallops to start, very tasty monk-fish, and perfectly prepared duck breast. The staff even made sure to get us out of there on time for the Bulls game we were headed to. I don't hesitate at all to recommend Boka..., Boka is a nice place for dressing up and having a trendy contemporary American meal on a Saturday night. We went with friends and were actually able to talk without having to yell, even though every table was taken. The interior was funky and sophisticated without being over-the-top. And it looked like there was a back patio which I'd love to check out come summer.Food was very nice, although a little salty. Entree options were heavy with fish (which is fine for me, but probably not for everyone) and game, like pheasant, duck, and venison (again, probably doesn't suit everyone). Had a fabulous banana bread pudding for dessert.My boyfriend and I dropped $126 for the meal (including tax and tip): 2 glasses champagne, 2 apps, 2 entrees, 1 dessert. So it wasn't inexpensive. But it was a nice place for a Saturday night and, if there weren't so many restaurants in Chicago that I have yet to try, I'd probably go back.My only question: How do they keep the outside water pool from freezing?, 'My husband took me here for my b-day. I really liked the atmosphere and the staff was very nice, but for the price Ie had better food in other places. First I had the hamachi small plate which was amazing, and really set my expectations high for the main course. Unfortunately, even while looking at the menu online I can remember what my main course was. That pretty appropriate, actually, since it was just ok and clearly not very memorable.I was also disappointed in the chocolate crepes. Not because they weren good, just because they were so plain, like the kind of crepes you can get on Clark st. for 5 bucks.', LOVED the food, but was not crazy about the restaurant itself. First of all, we got seated at a horrible table that was way too close to the bar. When we asked for another table, they did not accommodate. Secondly, our server took forever to take our order and was so soft spoken I could not hear a word he was saying. I don't normally comment on bread, but the ciabatta was fantastic. I could not have made it better myself!! We started with the oysters - both Rocky Point and Kumamoto. The Rocky Point was fantastic with a mango/horseradish sauce - just the right amount of sweet and savory that really brought out the taste of the oysters. Was not too crazy about the Kumamoto. We then had the sea scallop appetizer. The yellow curry emulsion went very well with the pea sprouts. However, the scallop was just a tad bit over-cooked (why is it always so hard to get scallops right??)For the main course, I had the beef tenderloin, licorice braised short ribs, sweet potato pave and and shitake mushroom pastry. It was unbelievably good. The short rib melted in your mouth and went perfectly with the potato and mushroom pastry. The tenderloin was also very good, but was not trimmed very well. My friend had the veal cheeks (I had a bite). It was melt in your mouth yummy.For dessert we went with the blood orange creme brulee. Nothing special., Big taste in small portions! I went with some friends on reservations. It was a small wait, but it gives you time to get drinks at the bar and check the place out.I liked it immediately. The dining area felt like we were in a big tent. & the food was great. Everythings different -- the salad doesn't look like a salad but tastes great. I had halibut. It was a tiny piece but good as hell.I'll be back. But bring your bankroll -- we spent close to $300, but it was worth it (not, but whatever). Go check it out., 'I wanted so much to give this place a 4 or 5 star rating, but I wasnt really impressed with the taste of the food. Yelp reviews are usually accurate, but I starting to think maybe not. Despite that, everything was great: presentation, ambience, service, decor, etc... all superb. Perhaps the blame should really go to the new chef. So a friend and I had the Marinated Big Eye Tuna which I didnt at all find too delicious. She had the Beef Tenderloin which was dry and flavorless. My main course was the pheasant which was average tasting at best.', I ate here with my mom (who paid, of course) and we had an attractive meal and attentive service. We both ordered a salad as a first course and a first course as an entree. Nobody gave us a hard time about it, but I would have liked more than one piece of bread. You see, instead of putting a bread basket on the table, they have a guy come out and ask you if you prefer white or wheat, then they place it on your plate. I had to ask my server to get the guy to come back, because I wanted to try one of each. They were both really good, but sheesh.My salad was an attractive presentation of arugula, smoked hearts of palm, Granny Smith apples, spiced pecans and pomegranate seeds. Unfortunately, it was pretty bland. No salt and pepper on the table -- is this a new trend? It's starting to annoy me. For my main course we both ordered the risotto, and it was divine. We shared a strawberry rhubarb crisp for dessert.Not a terrific value for the money, but a nice experience to try, especially if someone else is paying., 'We had an 8-top here on Dining Out for Life day. The new chef/restaurant started 3/1/07. So all reviews previous should be stricken as irrelevant.Service was impeccable, the room beautiful, fellow diners looked fabulous, breads delish. And all for a good cause!The Food.. ehhh... meh... uhmm... the guy from Charlie Trotters but was clearly showed up by his pastry chef. We sampled majority of the menu that day, covering veal cheeks to pheasants to bacon wrapped tenderloins. Beet salad looked great, the deconstructed mozzarella on top of tapanade tasted seriously interesting. Perhaps due to the proximity of Alinea, a bit of foamed tasting like dried enoki(?) was even found on an entree.While all the ingredients were thoughtful (Israeli couscous, etc.) and interesting, no combination really stood out, especially my tomatoe/tomato seed dressed fish. Then came the chocolate napoleon we had for dessert. It was a SICK combination of mousse/creme/pastry, etc. For the food/ambience/experience, this is surely a 4 and perhaps 5* for some. For NOT meeting my vicarious Charlie Trotter experience, take away 1*.', For serious, Boka is the best restaurant in Lincoln Park. Okay, I've never been to Trotters or Alinea, but I'm pretty sure Boka is next in line: the food is great! Also, the bar is a great place to frequent once you've outgrown the scene at Tilli's., I was visiting from San Francisco and had to find a good place to eat.. love the atmosphere and our waiter was really sweet. Gaev us a lot of recommendations of where to go party after. Hostess was very friendly. Over all my experience was good. I can't for the life of me remember the food, but I know there was a phesant involved and pork, but my dish was a little dry... Still ate it all though. Love their bathrom decor. Would totally go back. Just to try out other dishes there. LOVE CHICAGO!, I so have to disagree with all the great reviews. I went here with high expectations and while the service and atmosphere were really lovely, the food left something to be desired. My salmon was undercooked (even though I specified that I wanted it medium, it was still pretty raw inside). Our appetizer was also seriously funky. Best part of the dining experience was my friend's face when her softshell crab came out and she didn't know it was actually going to be like....still in crab shape. She wouldn't eat it, but my friend traded her for that mediocre salmon I mentioned.Other than that mild amusement, I give this place a Blah., 'Smoke and Mirrors. This place invests waaaayyy too much energy in presentation and not enough in making food that simply tastes good. I suspect many of the good reviews come from the theater-out-of-town-crowd. Like the woman sitting at the table next to me who applauded when her salad came out. The same one who said, chardonnay, is that a white wine?.Nothing on the menu really looked all that appealing in the entree department and most of the dishes seemed to have pretty random ingredients.I had the ($12)salad with manchego and of course, the fried cheese was good. But too much going on and it had hard-not-ripe peaches. Blah.Had salmon for my entree and it didn really have a lot of flavor. Thank God I ordered a side of mac and cheese otherwise I really would have left hungry.The bar is cool, would maybe return for a drink, but no to the expensive ecclectic strange food combinations that just don taste that good. My husband and I chuckled on the way out that at least we could stop by Pizza Capri and get a good slice of pizza.', I actually found the food to be pretty amazing--it was the atmosphere I couldn't handle. I heard about it through a friend, and when I got there I realized everyone was over the age of 35. For a 21 year old, it was kind of awkward. I felt like I was being stared at. The waiter (although probably not much older than I) treated me like I was 12. He was nice, but could tell that we didn't out to this type of place often. Like I said, the food was great, but I would not recommend this place for anyone under the age of 35., I was looking for a place to impress my partner's new boss who was coming to town last Friday. Being the nosy foodie that I am, I was tasked with the job of finding a private, posh but not over the top place with great food.Originally I had planned to go to another place in the South Loop, but things changed and at 6pm I was scrambling to find another place on the North side. I was at my computer, with Yelp, Open Table and Google opened. I searched and searched. I scanned through the Reader. The places that sounded promising were all fully booked, predictably. I really didn't want to go to a place I already went before.And I really didn't want to disappoint the boss, not in terms of food standard or ambience. No mediocrity allowed.Then I read in the Reader how the chef of Trotter's for 9 years was helming this place, Boka. Chef at Charlie Trotter's? Now how could I go wrong with that, eh?I was crossing my fingers and praying that there would a chance I could get a reservation.I did.And Boka did not disappoint. We were seated in this small garden outside, with lights from the trees. It was cozy, a warm night with a light breeze.The staff was patient, courteous and knew their stuff, especially the girl behind the bar, who went on the explain the 12 kinds of beer they had available. The menu, though brief, was interesting.I had the cold hamachi (very fresh and very well paired sauces) appetizer which was amazing, and the soft shell crab, which was great. I did think my partner's salmon with cold soba was better though.Boka was a great choice, the only thing that wasn't perfect: the strawberry rhuharb crisp, which I thought was a tad too sweet., We went to Boka last weekend and we both LOVED it! The atmosphere was really nice, and we were seated in the open air section at the table closest to the outside, so while we were not sitting out there (which I was glad because it was really humid out), we were as close as could be so we got a little breeze - perfect! While we waited for our table we sat at the bar and the bartender let us try different wines so we could pick one for our dinner. She was extremely knowledgable and professional. For our appetizer we had the quail w/some sort of croquette that had goat cheese in it and it was fabulous! For our entrees my date had the veal cheeks and they just absolutely melted in your mouth! I had the beef tenderloin with licorice braised short ribs and I was very impressed with how much beef there was. It was exellent, and the ribs were amazing as well. The sweet potato pave and asparagus complemented the meat very well! For dessert, we ordered a cheese platter and picked out 3 cheeses. I thought each one of them was so good, but my date only liked the Manchego that we got (and he is the one that loves cheese, not me!) We also got the Clarissa and Saint-nectaire. The plate came with little grapes, berries, and pears, and also with 6 pieces of raisin bread. It was de-lish! Finally, we had the Chocolate-Raspberry Tart and the Blood Orange Creme Brulee for dessert - and no, we did not order both of these, it was compliments of the chef b/c we know his gf and asked to meet him! The tart was super rich, but the creme brulee was amazing, and I normally do not like creme brulee, so I thought it was pretty darn good for me to love it! The food and service was excellent, and we will definitely be back! It's also a good place to go just to get drinks and an appetizer or the cheese platter! LOVE BOKA!!!, It was nice, not an aaamazing experience. But a nice menu and we had a delicious French wine that was so smooth. I'd return. (ps..the volume of the room chatter was perfect, you could talk comfortably. so great place for the folks..), 'What a nice place! Such a treat to find a place where you can actually hold a conversation using a normal voice.Went here with my wife for a Saturday date night dinner. The ambience is quite sophisticated and interesting, with stretched fabric sails across the wall/ceiling juncture in the main room. There is also a covered terrace with a bar, an outside terrace and a bar/eating area at the front that faces Halsted. So, you have 4 distinct choices of atmosphere, which is cool.The food is delish - with endlessly interesting ingredients, flavors and especially textures. Wee not exactly foodies, but not hayseeds either, but we had to ask for clarifications of a few of the ingredients in some of the dishes before we could order. No big deal, and our waiter was perfectly willing and able to provide a succinct explanation of each item. Total for 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 4 glasses of wine, with tax and tip,was $148 - not cheap, but not bad, considering the quality of the experience. We go back, even though we have a LOT more restaurants on our to try list.Try it!', 'Atmosphere is missing soul. Food mediocre. Very Expensive.', 'I went with 3 other people, 8:30 reservation on a friday night. We were seated immediately.The atmosphere was nice; upscale but inviting, a lot of warm tones. I don remember there being music (?). The tables were filled, the crowd pretty mixed. Overall my first impression was good.The waiter introduced himself and asked about our preferences, and talked about the menu. It was seasonal, lots of squash and potatoes and mushrooms, although not overwhelmingly so. According to the wine-wisest among us, the wine selection was light on the french/italian with a good selection under $60.We downed some cocktails and got a bottle of white going. The oysters were good, as was another dish which I can remember. I ordered a tuna dish from the raw menu.The tuna...I just didn get the tuna. The plate consisted of some small pieces of tuna, over which were thin slices of radish and chunks of citrus (I think pineapple and grapefruit). If you think this through, you can imagine the citrus washing away the taste of the tuna, and since you are putting them in your mouth at the same time you are basically left with some fruit taste with a few tasteless bits. I didn understand what they were trying to do, to the extent that I wonder if they just forgot some critical piece - such as a sweet soy sauce or something that would tie it together. It bothered me mainly because everything else was really well conceived so this was just really out of place.About 10 minutes after the appetizers were cleared, the entrees arrived. We had only been seated 45 minutes ago; we still had full glasses of our first bottle of white. We quickly ordered a red and set the white aside, but this was a big issue....Il get back to it.I gotten the duck, which was excellent, and came with a vidlia onion flan that was fascinating (although maybe texture sensitive types might have a few alarms go off). The lamb chops were just ok, the veal cheeks were the star. We had sides of lentils with horseradish (awesome!) and mac n cheese (others liked these but I didn find it worth the space).Desserts were beautiful and excellent.The timing issue on the entrees pretty much threw the whole thing off. The waiter was great, and I think he read what was going on and encouraged us to take our time. In general the staff was great, I liked the atmosphere, and almost all the food was both good and interesting. Clearly the chef and dessert chef are putting together ideas - the ones that work are great so I left feeling like maybe a few lost something in execution. However at nearly $30 a plate, you have to get everything right, and you absolutely can rush a table, and these unfortunately are deal breakers for me.', boka has pretension to spare. Went here with a group of 4 to celebrate a friend's birthday. Yes, we were a bit younger than their typical clientele, but that didn't mean it was our first time out to dinner somewhere besides McDonalds. The food was quite good, although not the best I've had in Chicago. They could do with telling their staff to lighten up a little bit. It is an upscale restaurant but a little bit goes a long way, there's no need to drive the point home with a bad attitude. There is a small bar in the front that looks like a nice place to meet friends before heading out for the night. It was a nice evening but don't think I'll be back as I like places that have more of an experience to offer than simply being somewhere that feels expensive., I wanted to like Boka so much but I have to say that aside from having a sophisticated interior and being seated promptly, the only thing I remembered about this experience was our pretentious waitress. There was nothing memorable about the food and considering I can't even remember exactly what I ordered to eat (some standard white fish, I think), I consider that a bad sign since this place was certainly not cheap. I came with some girlfriends for dinner on a weekend night and our watiress didn't even bother trying to hide her condescending attitude. I am the first one to appreciate the staff's recommendations but I'm no fool, thank you very much! I know when someone is talking down to me and by the way our waitress asked us questions and made snide comments, I'm pretty sure she assumed we didn't even know how to pick up a fork. My friends and I left perplexed seeing as how we dropped a lot of money for the works and left feeling more awkward and uncomfortable over content and full. Boo hoo Boka.EDIT 1/3/08 - The owner contacted me, apologized for my above visit and offered a free dinner to try and change my opinion. I of course accepted and went back to impeccable service. From the flexible hostess answering the phones (I stupidly messed up the time of our reservation), to the unbelievably efficient busboys and our wonderful waiter, RJ, I had the opportunity to thoroughly enjoy the delicious food with the service enhancing the entire dining experience instead of hampering it. The general manager, Ian, stopped by to make sure everything was going well and he was extremely sincere and professional about the slightly awkward situation (okay and yes, he's easy on the eyes). We sat in a MUCH better area - a cozy table in the front in dim lighting instead of our previous round booth in back that put us on display in a spotlight.Overall, we really enjoyed the food. My personal favorites (between the 2 of us) were the crispy pork belly and the grilled pear and manchego salad... to die for. What I loved most was that the meal wasn't so heavy that we felt like we needed to be carted out (as is often the case) when we were through - we still felt sated and ready to go out for a fun friday night. And believe me, we ate everything. Oh, and don't be a fool and skip the dessert. Maybe it's my asian palate speaking but the desserts (some type of crepe and a dark chocolate deliciousness) were AMAZING. It wasn't overly sweet (and I tend to think most desserts are) but they still had a ton of flavor., Great food, cool atmosphere and we had excellent service. We were a party of 16 for a friend's birthday and they treated us very well. I was astounded that they broke up the bill by couple without any fuss. I will go there again, most likely for a more romantic dinner with my wife.The only drawback was the portion sizes were a little smallish relative to the prices., Went to Boka last night, and absolutely loved it! I had very high expectations going in, and they were most certainly met. We got there a little early, so we sat in the bar and ordered drinks. My Grey Goose dirty martini was good; not the best I've had (that would be at Chicago Firehouse), but still good.Our server, Adrian, was knowledgeable, friendly, funny, and made great recommendations. Per his recommendation, I started with the scallop and my friend had the celery root soup. The scallop was excellent, perfectly cooked and well complimented by the rest of the plate. The celery soup was good, but I didn't care for the anise that was in the crab cake in the center of the soup. Nice presentation, though.One of my friends was at Boka last weekend, and I was surprised to see that the things that he liked were not on last night's menu. I can't imagine that the seasons changed much in a week, but they must really update the menu religiously. For my entree, I had the venison, which was excellent. Having never had venison, I wasn't sure what to expect but it was cooked to perfection and well complimented by wild rice and brussell sprouts. The manager came by to see how everything was, and even removed some empty glasses from our table.For dessert, I had the white chocolate curry panna cotta with mango sorbet. The two flavors together were spectacular! I also had a passion fruit margarita, recommended by Adrian. The drink first came out very tart, and when he asked me how it was I was honest with him. He took the drink back to the bar, had the bartender make it sweeter, and then let us know that it was on the house. Certainly not necessary, but a nice gesture!And finally, while we were waiting to get our coats, our server came to the front of the restaurant to thank us one last time.On a side note--I noticed on the wine list that there is a $25 corkage fee with a max of two bottles...so I guess you can BYOB? Not necessary because they have a great wine list, but good to know I suppose.A great experience at Boka; I will definitely be going back!, 'This place has a cool vibe. If I wasn wearing long underwear, it may have passed for a West Hollywood or South Beach spot.The crowd was relatively mixed- well as mixed as you can get for a Saturday night in Lincoln Park.The raw bar is a must. The oysters were fresh, well complimented by the various garnishes. We had the quail appetizer which was cooked perfectly. We got a free polenta-eggplant-goat cheese concoction of an appetizer, courtesy of the chef. Always love a freebie when youe blowing $200 on a meal. The bread guy that frequents the table to let you pick your carb of choice is also a nice touch.Entre-wise, I had the barrimundi. Flavorful and flaky, and served with an interesting side of veal tongue. Overall the dish was extremely well-seasoned for contemporary American cuisine.The two semi-disappointments came with strong endorsements from our pushy but attentive waitress. To be fair, we did ask for recommendations. First was the pork belly. Ours was a bit overcooked and the texture was tougher then it should have been. Did enjoy the side of crispy buckwheat noodles that accompanied it. Buckwheat, under any other circumstances, would be punishment. But this was a tasty surprise. We also got conned into a dark chocolate mousse macaroon for dessert. The mousse filling was delicious. But the macaroon crusty thing was inedible- it was rock hard and impossible to cut into without a steak knife or some other weapon.', 'I was really impressed by this place. Very nice decor with a classy bar separating the dining areas. The dining area to the right (East) has this draping fabric looking material hanging from the ceiling. It reminds me of the Denver airport, and not in a bad my flight is delayed way. Had the Kumamoto oysters and the special grilled octopus appetizer to start off-both were fabulous. The venison loin and whitefish entrees were superb. As far as sides go, I recommend the mac and cheese with edamame-it very fresh & delicious. Nice wine selection that is not overwhelming with too many choices. The service was very attentive and extremely accommodating. I highly recommend Boka due to it great decor, great service, impressive wine and delicious food.', Recently went to Boka for dinner, and our party was very pleased with the evening. The decor is clean and classy, not stuffy, with exposed brick, dark wood, and dim candle lighting throughout. Service was superb, with detailed explanations of all orders. Presentation was excellent -- appealing yet not pretentious. Because we ordered a house-recommended wine which by the way was terrific - HDV Cabernet, we were kindly rewarded with a tasty amuse-bouche sampler for each of us. All of our entrees were very good, and we left without a complaint. For the quality of the food and the ambience, the prices are fair. It's hard to get 5 stars from me, but Boka is a solid 4., Boka is right around the corner from me, so I've been here a whole bunch of times over the last three years. It's always been very good, but about a year or so ago, they got a new chef, and they added a pastry chef within the last few months.Here's the thing about their menu- it's challenging. You may look at it and wonder what half the listed ingredients are in each of the dishes, and you may only find one or two things that jump out at you as being what you're in the mood for, but that's the joy of this place. The ingredient pairings are creative and interesting, and it makes for some out of this world dishes. I've never had anything that hasn't been excellent, but I'd especially recommend the strip loin, and if you're a fish fan, the barramundi is a slice of heaven.Some of the other reviewers are calling the service at Boka pretentious, but in my experience, that's an unfair criticism. Like any high end, formal restaurant, the servers are professionals and trained to offer very formal service. But if you joke with them, they'll joke with you. None of the servers I've had have been unfriendly or unwilling to spend a little time at the table talking about the food or the wine.If you really want a more laid back experience, they offer the full menu at the bar. Daniel is here five nights a week, and he's got to be the coolest bartender in the city. Last night he recognized me even though it's been at least 5 months since my last visit, and the girlfriend (marissa d) and I felt like honored guests the rest of the night-- complimentary champagne (because Daniel thought it went much better with our oysters than the wine I'd ordered), a raw tuna appetizer, roasted root vegetables for a side with our entrees, and a dessert. Needless to say, we rolled out of there pleased as punch and happy as little clams. Of course we'll be back!, My wife and I stopped here with another couple one saturday night for dinner. We didn't have a reservation and was told that a table would be avaliable in 15 minutes. We decided to wait at the bar until our table was ready. The place was super busy that night. We had two rounds of drinks and actually waited for about 25 minutes. The place was kinda sexy and romantic and staff was very friendly. It made our wait enjoyable. We finally were seated and had a fabulous meal. I plan to go back soon. We had a great time, 'This place. What can I say about it?The atmosphere and decor were very nice, swank even. My friends and I popped in on a whim and a vague recommendation from a colleague in the food industry. We weren necessarily expecting it to be so pricey, but we rolled with the punches. I ordered a Salmon dish that was beyond incredible. Seriously. If the rest of their dishes are half as good, this restaurant has something going for it. Then, we finished the meal with an assortment of cheeses. I know, weird, huh? But it was great. Really enjoyed it.Now comes the complaint. I have been a server for almost three years, and while the server we had at Boka was knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful, she was missing the one thing I like most: personality. Man, she was so freaking fake! It like she went to the bathroom before every table to make sure her smile was perfect while running over such cliche lines as to die for and a little slice of heaven. My friends and I almost gagged when she ran that last one. I understand restraint to cross the line in the face of high class patrons, but this was ridiculous. All in all, like I said, she was a great server. I just would have liked to see her real personality and not a Joker-fied version of it.So let recap. Food - awesome, but pricey. Service - helpful, but frightening.', This was great! The atmosphere is excellent. Great patio area, although...I wish we were sitting inside, I was not crazy about the covered patio. I will definitely be back in the summer to sit out there.The service was good, I thought our waitress was very attentive, helpful, knowledgeable. The food was great!! Our table shared...I really enjoyed appetizers: Tuna, Scallop, Beet Salad; entrees: Strip Loin, Salmon, Trout...I ordered the Bass, which came out way over seasoned and too salty, I sent it back and put in an order for the Strip Loin (delicious!), the chef also put a new piece of bass on my plate, which was excellent the second time around. The desserts were ok...I just don't think I cared for the flavors. The small plate of chocolate treats they brought out was perfect!!Great experience....looking forward to visiting this summer. (if the summer decides to show up!)Cheers!, Definitely one of the best restaurants in the city! Attentive service and more than helpful waitor. Food was amazing! (highly recommend the scallop appetizer, trout entree, tenderloin entree, white chocolate dessert, and of course drinks). A must-eat-at restaurant and a fantastic addition to Chicago's fine dining list., 'I had dinner with a good friend last Friday night at Boka. We had a 9:15pm reservation and the place was still packed. We had to wait a few minutes for a table, but it gave us a chance to grab a glass of wine. The menu was very diverse with many items we both wanted to sample. We ordered three courses and the server split every course so we could try each item without us even asking.Our first course was the grilled octopus and the tuna tartar. Just to mention, the grilled octopus was the highlight of the dinner, not to say anything was bad, just the octopus was phenomenal. The smokiness with the citrus was wonderful.Second course we had the chamomile dusted quail and the veal sweetbreads. Both equally tasty and went very well with the Marcel Deiss Pinot Gris from Alsace. For our entre we had the trout with grilled salsify and the short ribs. By this time, we were pretty full so the entrees were a bit much, our fault for ordering so much food, I think our eyes were bigger then our bellies. Our bellies were not too full to order a bottle of Flowers Pinot Noir that went well with both the trout and the short ribs.Overall the experience was great. We got a chance to meet the owner and Chef Tentori. Both men were very gracious host. One highlight to mention was our food runner. I can not remember his name, but he was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, had great energy and I thought was primed to be a server. Come to find out, he will be a server at their new location when it opens. Congrats to him.', 'This place was a big disappointment. Since their menu changes so much, its hard to base a restaurant review on one dish but I have to. I sure that by today, the dish would have been removed and another one has taken its place. We arrived for our Sat reservations except they had lost our reservations. We had called the day before. How do restaurants lose reservations? We waited 15-20 min for our table at their bar. The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice and would have to agree that this would be a great date place. After we got seated at our table and ordered, we didn get any bread. We had to flag down the bread guy to give us some bread. I like to sometimes sprinkle a little sugar on my butter, but when I asked for sugar, I got equal, sweet and low and cubed sugar. I like how you get to pick out what type of bread you want. It reminded me of Frazoli where the breadstick woman walked around with her basket.We ordered the grilled octopus appetizer and the waiter was kind enough to split it for 2 people. It was good, but not that best Ie had (best was at Spring). It was served in salad form with bbq eel, bacon, and other vegies. Around the plate was arugala with apples and yogurt/creme fraiche mixture with mussels. Besides the one mussel that had a lot of grit, it was good. So I ordered the angus strip loin entree while my bf ordered the braised pork cheeks. My entree came deconstructed which with some dishes, I enjoy. Except this dish, I just didn get. The angus strip loin was cooked well but I needed more flavor. There was rutabaga which i didn particularly care for, along with a pile of mushroom schnitzel that just tasted like tiny deep fried flour to me. There was a separate piece of braised short rib that was exceptionally dry that I could not even eat it. The worst thing on the plate was the spinach flan. I love spinach, but it was tasteless as flan, and the texture didn help. It was garnished with a big piece of bacon which couldn even save the life of the spinach flan. I found the whole dish very disconnected, the flavors were very bland, and it left a lot to be desired. I also remember eggplant being on the menu with the dish, but maybe I mistaken. On the other hand, my bf loved his dish a lot. So I understand how Boka has gotten rave reviews. A couple of other things that were distracting were the two tables next to us. One table was a big family that maybe knew the chef because the waiter kept giving them plates of food after plates of food saying compliments of the chef. The table right next to ours was a guy and a girl who were friends with our waiter. They were also receiving complimentary food. Along with them being loud, they kept staring at our food (I mean hello I sitting not even a foot away from you) and commenting on it, followed with stop it! stop staring at their food. I don want to judge a restaurant by its guests so this review is solely based on the food. I do find it important that I add on what made my night less enjoyable as well. Not sure if this place is worth coming back for. Ie had much better food for the same price at other restaurants.', 'There nothing really wrong with Boka, but the food is not particularly memorable, either. The service is pretty good. There were no inordinately long waits or bad attitudes. They did a good job of doing a few little things for my girlfriend birthday. The wine list isn bad, and there are some reasonably priced wines on there. The cocktail menu is pretty interesting (including one that involved beet juice and was great).And while the food tasted good and was presented nicely, none of the flavors were memorable. Hillsborough oysters were paired with a mango puree in unholy matrimony. It was really a turnoff. The hamachi starter was nice, as it was accompanied by young coconut and other garnishes that made sense. Other appetizers and the entrees, however, seemed to involve 3-4 disjointed components and several wipes of puree on the plate. It was visually appealing, but the flavors didn jump out in any way.I not a dessert person, generally, but the desserts were the highlight of the meal. They have several that are sweet/savory. The curry panna cotta is addictive. The prices are fair. It not a cheap place, but we got out of there with a bottle of wine, two cocktails, three starters, two entrees, and two desserts for about $250 all in. In short, you can have a good meal here bookended by great drinks and great desserts. Or you can pay the same price and have a better meal elsewhere, because the bar pretty high in this town anymore.', 'How did this place average out to only 4 stars? No idea. It awesome.But first, a digression.My wife and I went there the other night and we took our 2 month old. I voted good for kids below anyway, because there staff was so nice, but I probably wouldn do it again. If youe thinking about taking your infant there, you should know a) that the staff will be great and helpful and b) that yours will likely be the only one there. It way too nice for the kiddies. Having said that, ours--affectionately referred to as The Critter--was perfect. We had a great time.OK: let talk food. THIS IS THE BEST FOOD I HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME. And not just because we have a two month old. I had halibut--it was cooked perfectly, presented interestingly. My veggie wife had a veggie tart--also excellent. The two gentlemen we were with: one had salmon, the other beef. Everything was outstanding.The service was also perfect. We chatted with another friend last night who ate there a couple of years ago and she had a similarly good experience.It not cheap. In fact, it expensive.', 'good place for a very nice dinner.', I would do 3.5 if I could. was in here the other night with my boyfriend and after all the hype I have heard about Boka, I left feeling a bit disappointed. We started with a pear salad, Diver scallop and quail, the appetizers were good, but not amazing. My entree of trout, was rather bland, though my boyfriend's sirloin, or whatever meat he ordered, he said was quite good. I tried the short ribs that accompanied the steak and that was amazing. I wish they made a whole dish for that! What was the best part of the dinner was the dessert. The pastry chef is wonderful. The assorted cookies and the coconut tapioca with mango sorbet, awesome! Overall, great ambiance, great wine menu, but the food is all over the place, some of it was seasoned and put together to great, some was just bland., 'We were just here last night, I have to say, we found it completely overrated. I had the mushroom broth and it was cold and bland, which was pretty much the theme of all our food for the evening. The only standouts were the mac and cheese and the mint cucumber salad. Overall, it was a complete, overpriced disappointment. Maybe we were just there on an off night, but I would suggest you save your money and head across the street instead.', 'This place rocks. We went with another couple and tried almost all of the appetizers. Everything was great. Is it cheap - no, but unlike a lot of restaurants here, they try to use local, organic food and olive oil in lieu of butter and cream. Highly recommend for a nice night out!', 'I had a wonderful dinner here last week. The Hamachi appetizer was amazing. The entrees (mahi mahi with veal tongue - sounds crazy but worked and short ribs) we ordered were so good! Also tried mac+cheese with edamame which was unique and tasty. From the time we walked in we were only greeted with ridiculously friendly people. Overall, food/atmosphere/service were all outstanding. I feel like it has been a while since I have been to a restaurant that seemed to get it all right and Boka definitely delivered!', The Largest Octopus Salad You Have Ever Seen or Could Imagine.I honestly can not recall the exact entree I ordered... (TROUT? with truffle AIR, salsify and watercress?)... because I ate to much before it ever arrived and then, when it hit, our party just kept passing all the plates around any way. No matter.Chef Giuseppe came out from the kitchen, stopped by our table to say hello, made jokes and offered to answer an questions. So cool.We maybe consumed the entire menu without regret, including at least two of each dessert, and I dreaming just now of whichever one had the sweet pink sorbet and complementary 'consomme'... What is rhubarb? I think so.Might I add, the service was over-the-top, dare I say- PERFECT. From the moment I stepped into Boka, the hostess and manager were genuine, quick to greet, carefully checked my cheap ugly jacket and junky backpack, and then away we go, where I was guided to the bar, awaiting my companions. The bartender was jolly-nice and offered great beverage suggestions. Once all guests arrived, our very articulate server helped to seat us promptly. Off to an wonderful start , and the evening got completely out of hand with good time: fancy food and ridiculous conversation. Simple and memorable.Bing-O Ba-Ling-O. Party of TEN = $$$$Would have set me back a bit, but someone else picked up our tab!!! (Thank you! You know who you are. You're sweeter than that rhubarb consomme! Thank you.), 'Have had dinner here several times and it is great! Love the scallop appetizer, trout or seabass. Really good seasonal desserts. The kiwi cocktail is so good & refreshing. Nice wine list too and very helpful service.', Went hear with family/girlfriends parents gathering and it was a great time. We ate on an enclosed patio thing were the seats were uneven, like at Cafe Ba Ba Reeba. The main thing everyone got a kick out of was the unique food. I just reviewed Landmark, it has the same owners so it has the same freshness and seasonal ingredients, this is just the more fancy one of the two (I think). I only give it 4 stars because Ink from my squid (octopus?) appetizer stained my fingers and was also not as tasty as I wanted but I was trying new things. Also I tried some of my brothers pork belly and I didn't dig that either.Besides those two thing the service was amazing and the food was very good. Everyone was telling me I did a great job picking the place and my dad punched me because of the bill he had to pay., I was really impressed. Boka came in at 5 stars on all levels - service, ambiance, food, and value.The Ambiance: While this wouldn't be the most critical element of a restaurant for me, it definitely plays a part. Boka had soft internal lighting and well spaced tables. The doors to their spacious rear dining patio were open, adding to the 'outdoor' effect of the restaurant. The results were calming and very attractive.The Service: The service was impeccable. My partner and I probably didn't immediately seem to be appealing customers - we were both in jeans and t-shirts, and were a bit rumpled. The staff didn't even bat an eye, and were friendly and welcoming. I say this not because I paid it much attention at the time, but rather because I was surprised that another review felt the restaurant was stuffy. That just wasn't our experience. Our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and wine list, was attentive without being overbearing, and when asked, offered insightful advice on the menu.The Food: I was blown away. Now, normally, I'm able to recall all the details of what I ate. In this case, the number of courses, coupled with the complexity of most of the dishes precludes an exact summary. My first impressions of the menu were that many of the dishes looked too complex, seemingly built on too many flavors that I just didn't think would work together to result in a cogent dish. Happily, as the meal progressed, I found that I was mistaken. In fact, while chef Tentori seems to delight in playing with complex flavor and textural combinations, I was impressed by how often those combinations ended up serving to elevate a very simple ingredient - the porcini's, grilled octopus, Chinese black rice, and even arugula. Tentori had a very good handle of when to go full throttle, and when to dial things back.The Value: Boka is not a cheap restaurant. Our bill came to $160 before tip, and included 4 appetizers, 1 entree, 1 desert, a few glasses of wine and sparkling water. Bottom line, while it might have been a good chunk of change, it was a very cheap meal.I almost hesitate to mention this, because I don't feel that you should ever go to a restaurant expecting to be comped items. That being said, part of what made this experience so spectacular was that our sever ended up comping us 4 courses over and above what we had ordered, giving us an incredibly deep access to the menu. One of these comped items was one of the best dishes I have ever had in a restaurant - a 'deconstructed BLT' that managed to be delicious, surprising, complex, and even simple and pure all at the same time. To me, this dish, triumphing despite it's apparent contradictions, summarizes Chef Tentori's food, and makes Boku a moral imperative for foodies in Chicago.In the end, we came in as strangers, and were treated like family. The food ranged from simple to complex, and showed an impressive grasp of texture and flavor. We'll fly back to Chicago to come to this restaurant. Specific suggestions for appetizers include the Poke, the Squid, and the 'deconstructed BLT' salad. Our trout entree was also delicious, and paired well with the black rice side, which had a subtle aromatic flavor and crunchy texture that really balanced the other strong flavors at our table. Our desert, the bananna fritters with coconut tapioca, was also fantastic., 'Its very rare that you have dining experiences which really touch your soul. It may not even be because its the best meal or the best service, but more a cosmic combination of your mood, the thrill of a new place, the warmth of a welcome, or the hunger in your belly. I had such an experience at Boka.My boyfriend and I were on our first trip to Chicago. We wanted to savor the best the city had to offer, so, we immediately made ourselves reservations at Charlie Trotters. No doubt one of the best chefs and restauranteurs around, yet, we began to think, is this restaurant tired? Did we want to waste our one chance at somewhere that wasn as hot? I reached out to some locals and got great recommendations, Ghrahm Elliot, Blackbird, and Alinea were all possibilities. But it was the last minute suggestion of a New York native to try Boka. Without hesitation, we simply agreed. We had no pre-conceived notions, no images of the place, no reviews, nothing to set the tone for the evening.We were first met by a hostess of pure joy. She seemed thrilled by nothing more than our decision to try their restaurant. We were promptly seated in the out door section of the restaurant. I happen to be a seating nazi and will ask to be moved for the smallest reason (I can see the bathroom, I by the cash register, I cant see outside, etc.) So being sat in a corner in the out door section would usually enrage me, but it was quiet, peaceful, warm, and inviting. Our waitress appeared and began the feeding process. We quickly learned she had a vast knowledge of not only the menu, but of food, wines, Chefs, and restaurants alike. We were impresses by her brain. And the eating began.The bread basket selection was very charming. I am picky with breads and was thrilled that I got to select my own (perhaps I am a bit easily amused). We each ordered 3 courses apiece. The food was simply delectable. Each dish was balanced, fresh, and inventive. Some dishes were better than others, but the way they all married together was perfect. We were also presented with 3 additional side dishes, compliments of the Chef. Several times we were approached by managers checking on our enjoyment of the meal. For the finale we each ordered a dessert with a complementary wine to follow. A nice ice-wine and Sauternes finished the meal. After a lovely conversation with our waitress about food + life, we paid our bill. We weren ready to leave yet though! So, we ventured into the bar to have even more love poured down out throats. We instantly bonded with the bartender, like old friends we regaled each other of stories of California, Batman, and In-N-Out burger all to the flavors of fantastic, hand crafted libations. If we didn have another engagement to meet, we would have never left. On our way out, the pure joy hostess expressed again her happiness and thankfulness that we dined with them that evening. She even walked us outside to send us off.I can only describe this experience of that of Disneyland. Magic.', 'My husband and I went to Boka for our one year anniversary. I wanted someplace romantic with interesting food and drinks. WOW, did we score with Boka!When we arrived, we mentioned it was our anniversary and the hostesses were very warm and congratulatory. We went to the bar and had the Kiwi sour and the Love Child drink (strawberry infused vodka) which were OUTSTANDING. Probably the best cocktails Ie ever had...and Ie had my fair share of cocktails. The ambiance and decor in Boka are very warm and romantic. Once we were shown to our table, we were treated like royalty. Our waiter was very knowledgeable on the menu and made wonderful recommendations. The waitstaff here should be commended on their service. They are there to serve you before you even realize you need something, and yet you never even realize theye there. They are masters of their craft, are never intrusive and made the evening one to remember.To top the evening off, the dessert chef sent out a plate with a few cookies and on the plate was written Happy Anniversary. These small touches are what make this restaurant stand out. They take care of you from start to finish, and go the extra mile to make sure you enjoy your dinner.Thank you Boka for making this anniversary one to remember.', 'These stars are for my fantastic and patient waiter Robbey. I am a very picky eater and a vegetarian. I get nervous going to eat at restaurants I have never been to before and I usually drive waiters and my fiance crazy. Robbey knew everything about what was on the menu and what the chef would be willing to make. He took excellent care of the both us and we loved our food. Thankyou Robbey, I look forward to seeing you again at Boka.', 'I just realized that I have failed to write a review on my fav summer spot...Boka. My first experience here, a few years back, was negative...but, I tried again and again and again...and each time is better. I really love it now... The menu is great, the food is fresh and the ambiance is inviting. The service is superb, from the girls at the front to the bar to the waiters. Make a point this summer to have dinner with friends on the patio...it is an oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the city...even with Halsted just steps away. You will be delighted. See you there!'|1
14|californios-san-francisco|We chose the chef's selection, and I think I'll do that every time. Each part of the meal that came out was inspired, fresh, and well, basically amazing! We also had the wine pairing which was perfect for each course. They were (I think 4) full pours, so I think I might share it next time with my husband. The staff is all very knowledgable but not pretentious at all. All in all, I can't wait to come back!, So happy that Val's restaurant is officially open! I've been patiently waiting for this day since hearing about his goal to open his own restaurant. There had been some pop up meals here and there but I have not been lucky with timing and missed out on those events so I made sure I jumped on reservations ASAP when I caught wind of the soft opening.Val and his team put together a very fun and creative menu with delicious flavor profiles. The dishes were described to me as modern Mexican cuisine although I thought only a few of the items subtly reflected that. Yet, I was very happy with the taste of everything that was put before me and found the wines to pair extremely well with my courses. I think I just about died and went to heaven over the perfectly grilled beef tongue alongside an Argentinian Merlot. Drooooool! Another favorite of mine from dinner was a very rich soup broth (I think it was duck?!? Maybe chicken...Too much vino, I forgot!) which my friend and I shamelessly lapped up every single last drop in our bowls.I'm looking forward to returning to Californios once their doors officially open starting Jan 2., I'm into it. After hearing about the restaurant opening, I made reservations for opening night (1/2). With minimal information available about the menu other than it being upscale Mexican food, my curiosity was piqued.Upon arrival, we were given the option to sit at a table or the bar -- we opted for the bar to sit closer to the action. Service was slightly awkward at first (3 different people greeted us, no offering of drinks right away though water was given immediately, delayed explanation of the menu and courses), but extremely friendly and certainly warmed up. We were told that there was a choice between two 4 course meals (meat or vegetable) sort of omakase style, with the option of a wine pairing. We chose the meat course and selected a bottle of the sparkling cab franc. For food:Chips and salsa - reminiscent of a fried corn puff with fish roe and fermented chili sauceLime granita with homemade pop rocks (which I spilled all over)Smoked kampachi with fish sauce, chopped cilantro stalks, radish and chili Chicken soup of reduced chicken broth mixed with faro starch water mixed with more chicken broth; tender piece of chicken cooked sous vide, pomegranate, pickled turnip/radish with chilisGrilled beef tongue (lengua) in mole sauce, avocado purd9e and grilled onionMeringue, chocolate creme de pot, and blood orange sorbetFoie gras salted ice cream, crumbled tortillas Mexican wedding cookies The chicken soup, grilled lengua, and foie gras ice cream were my favorite. I've never had tongue that tender and the soup was super hearty. We bugged Chef Val and his staff with plenty of questions which enhanced our experience. For the first night of being open, I'd say they managed quite well and will certainly like to return to see what else Chef Val comes up with as a play on Mexican cuisine!, 'Note: we are not friends/family of the restaurant - we are regular people who walked in right off of the street on our way to our dinner reservation at a different place around the corner. We were curious because of the frosted windows and the fun music that we could hear...so we went in...we enjoyed a glass of sparkling wine and learned it was opening night. Because of the nice vibe, we made a reservation for the next night to find out more...this is what we discovered:Californios is a hip spot in the Mission with a different twist on traditional Mexican food. The menu is surprising, presentation is impeccable, and the flavors are new -- but grounded in tradition. A true shining star is the chicken dish that the chef pours a fantastically well-executed broth over, with the surprise of a nice pickled vegetable - resulting in truly great flavor. Wine pairings are off the beaten track and thought provoking. We also enjoyed the play on chips with salsa, and the end of meal ice creams which were creative and delicious.This is a brand new place - the staff are warm, welcoming, and open to feedback. They have a highly trained staff with impressive backgrounds resulting in food that is conceived and prepared from the heart and served with grace. Give this place a try and experience something new in the Mission.', We ate there last night and first of all the place is beautiful! We have heard such wonderful things about the pop ups we wanted to give it a try! First.... We were under the impression that this concept was going to be Mexican food. Sadly it's not, it's better described as moderne California cuisine. In San Francisco it's common practice for most of the restaurants to cross over to other cultures to complete a dish and/or to give the dish a modern twist by adding in an ingredient such as a chile or fish sauce, however the essence of each of these dishes at Californios had more modern technique as the center peice than the flavors and soul of Mexican cuisine. We are both from Latin America and one of us is from Mexico. Yes, there are some chile peppers on the kampachi and lengua as the place of beef, three black bean dots, mexican wedding cookies at the end of the meal (which were delicious! and the only thing with the heart and soul of Mexico)...but we were hoping for a breath of fresh air with a homage to Mexican cuisine..but instead I think we got a lower version of Commis in the mission district. The food plating is impeccable and the flavors are great but the Second let down of the meal was the portion size. I love the chef's tasting menu concept: to try what the chef believes is important to eat at a given moment durning a particular season ...but the literal meaning of tasting is ridiculous. We've just eaten at 11 Madison park and there too ordered the tasting menu.....huge difference! Look at the pictures posted previously and you can see the lengua & dessert off set on a plate. The plate is not oversized but about average. I would recommend this place for a light modern meal with great wines and beautiful atosmphere. The music sounds like it came from someone's iPod and the service is great. All in all, another hipster joint in the mission., Yes I agree it's not Mexican food and a little pricey for the food you get. I probably will not eat there again., It is *extremely* difficult to pull off cuisine that is both conceptual and delicious. Daniel Patterson pulls it off at Coi, and Josh Skenes at Saison, James Syhabout at Commis also come to mind. Conversely, there are others that fall a bit short too -- Central Kitchen, Commonwealth, and Sons & Daughters just don't do it for me personally (even though I understand the chef here had worked at the latter). Flavor can take a backseat to the concept or, the point of view can get lost among too many forced techniques. Regardless of which ones we prefer, we're lucky to live in a part of the world with so many of these kinds of restaurants to experience and choose from.Californios does beautiful, personal, heady cuisine -- most importantly, that is also delicious -- that also prioritizes challenging those who dine there (down to the sign outside, down to the imagery on social media, etc). I can understand that might not appeal to some people, but I think it's important to have restaurants that can push boundaries in a real way without sacrificing flavor. What is Mexican food exactly? What can it be? Why do we put so many confines on it? If it becomes something unfamiliar, does that not make it Mexican food?I love that Val Cantu calls it Mexican food by the way, and I think it's fucking bold that he opened it in the Mission too. Is it Mexican food though? It's certainly fine dining with an eye on a Michelin star, but I would certainly say it's Mexican food. One slurp of the chicken soup broth will take you back to your abuela's house, but then you bite into the pickled turnips in that same bowl and you're transported somewhere else entirely. As for the beef tongue -- obviously it's not your late night lengua taco, but if they didn't tell you it was tongue, I guarantee you would never notice because it's that delicate -- and *that* good. The plating and presentation is all gorgeous, almost deliciously geometric on some dishes (never thought I would say that).As I mentioned before, you get the feeling that the food is personal too. It's a cozy small space (love the black interior, btw), so the sense is that you're one of only a few others making similar discoveries. That's the perfect backdrop for what is going on here.I went on one of the first nights and apparently they will have an expanded tasting menu soon, and I can't wait to get back., '4.5 STARS*After dinner at Californios*Me: Mmmm, I can eat like this every day.Mr. NSS: Of course you can, IF you don mind pushing around a shopping cart with your belongings.Damn, that got shut down quick.Opening on 1.2.15, Californios took over the old Manos Nouveau spot (bit.ly/1Bqqrly) in the Mission. Californios calls themselves Mexican fine dining but I found the food to be more Californian with Mexican influences. There two tasting menus (meat or vegetarian) for $57 pp and wine pairings are an additional $35 (I received 4 pours). There an 18% service charge that shared among the entire staff. Similar to omakase, the chef (formerly Sons & Daughters) and his sous chefs prepare a series of gorgeous dishes using the best seasonal ingredients available. The portions are small but it not any different than the portions Ie had at Saison, Manresa, and Atelier Crenn; and their tasting menus are $185-$298+. Did I contemplate on stopping by Escape from New York Pizza down the block afterwards? You betcha my fatass did but we didn. But for $57, this is a super reasonably cost tasting menu which I doubt theye making much profit from.~ * ~ T A S T I N G M E N U ~ * ~ Since we didn get to see the menu until the end of dinner which has a vague one word descriptor, my descriptions may be a little off or incomplete: bit.ly/14pFcc6.(1) Chips & Salsa w/ trout roe: bit.ly/14ds3SB(2) Huckleberry Granita w/ pop rocks: bit.ly/1Faspul(3) Foraged Salad: bit.ly/1rXBpgs(4) a. Smoked Torched Mackerel: bit.ly/1xutwQr(4) b. Kampachi Crudo: bit.ly/17df2dB(5) Chicken Soup w/ pomegranate seeds: bit.ly/1xKwi5O(6) Lengua Mole w/ avocado mash & cipollini onion: bit.ly/1BAvRbi(7) Romaine Granita w/ tea broth: bit.ly/1tJVW9s(8) Blood Orange Ice Cream & Chocolate Mousse: bit.ly/17dftoj(9) Foie Gras Ice Cream w/ apples & crumbles: bit.ly/1BAwd1V(10) Mexican Wedding Cookies w/ chili mango gelee: bit.ly/14duqVwNot being a fan of Sons & Daughters, I kept my expectations low but I was blown away with Chef Cantu tasting menu especially for the price. Of course there were a few missteps (the granitas) but theye still testing things out so that to be expected. The fancy play on chips & salsa with a burst of saltiness from the trout roe was lovely start to the tasting menu. Loved the deliciously smoky and meaty mackerel, and the kampachi crudo was amazingly fresh. Loved the plate it was presented on which gave it illusion that the crudo was smoking. The chicken soup was the best damn chicken soup Ie had. The broth had some serious depth of flavor going on with a pop of sweet tartness from the pomegranate. The sous-vide chicken breast? Incredibly silky and tender. Mr. NSS and I are lengua whores. The lengua mole was deliciously satisfying and oh so tender. Don knock it until youe tried it because lengua is one of most underrated cuts. The only thing I didn care for were the intermezzo granitas. Maybe because of the cold weather?The blood orange ice cream and chocolate mousse was decadent yet light. And, my eyes glistened when I heard the F word. The forbidden fruit in ice cream form savory sweet goodness in a scoop. Mr. NSSknow how much I love the F word and gave me his share. Both the crumbly Mexican cookies with a drizzle of dulce de leche (instead of powdered sugar), and the sweet heat from the chili mango gelee were addictive.My only suggestion is to add a bread course as a filler. I remember the best part of Sons & Daughter tasting menu were their bread courses. Dat pretzel bread doe. ~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~For the second night of opening, I thought the staff was on point and very well polished. From the hostess to the sommelier, everyone was really amiable, warm, and attentive. I just read that the front of the house is a French Laundry alum which all then made sense (love that place to pieces). We sat at the chef counter which started off really quiet but as the night progressed, the chefs were a little more engaging. From start to finish, the tasting menu took about 90 minutes. ~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~Cozy and romantic, Californios is a great date place. There only seating for 25 and seats at the chef counter so reservations are a must. I appreciated that the counter seats were very comfortable (read: wide and cushioned) for my tush. Growing up in the 90s, it was nostalgic to hear Boyz II Men and Usher playing in the background. ~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~Difficult. Nearest parking garage is 3 blocks away on 21st and Bartlett. Overall, a fantastic grand opening and I think Californios may be a good contender for a 2016 Michelin Star.', Best food, wine, and service I have ever had. First off the food is beautiful, elegant, and tastes amazing. the ambiance is romantic and sweet. I love the lighting, it just makes me feel cozy and comfortable. The food tastes amazing and is something I've never tasted before. The wine paired with each dish was honestly to die for. the girl who explains the wine is amazing at explaining the taste and history of the wine its just so good! the host is sweet, she will help you take your coat off and help you put it back on. shes always checking up on you and making sure everything is okay. I love the idea that they give you a menu at the end of dinner rather then before. the chefs behind the bar seemed to work really well together and it really shows on the food they serve. The restaurant is definitely not Mexican food BUT Mexican food inspired. In my opinion i think they are doing a great job at getting the Mexican flavors in and i cant wait to go back again., 'Wow this is the Best restaurant I can recommend to all my friends and visitors ,food , service is superb..its a very good price Pre-Fixe dnner plus Wine paring ...incredible price. You cant beat the price for a fine dining experience in San Francisco ...amazing....it s a wonderful experience to have considering that most Top Michelin Restaurant are enormously expensive but this one is just unbelievable ...very affordable I highly recommend it to all my friends and family.', 'Incredible meal paired with incredible service. We walked in expecting a couple of bumps along the road (seeing how it had ustopened) but we ended up receiving a whole lot more. You can consider this kind of eating elevated Mexican-influenced California food. My mind kept oscillating between, gee this tastes better than my grandma.... and damn this is good....no, wait...this is brilliant!The plating is beautiful. The portions are spot-on. And the flavors/ingredients are masterfully put together to give you something to think about.Our table immediately noticed the effect of food contrast throughout the meal. It started off light, colorful and zingy. Then turned darker, earthier and rich. Our pairing of a Barcelonian Beer maintained it versatility and relevance throughout most of the courses; it was so tasty we ordered a second bottle.In addition to great ambience, music, service...I found the menu to be surprisingly delightful. No, really. The actual menu you get to take home to brag (I mean, share) with your friends is quite the treat. Like I said, folks. Put on your best foodie-cap. This place is worth several visits. :)Of particular interest for our pre-fixe was the chicken soup and os. The chicken soup is not simple and requires a bit of navigation with the spoon. Reckless slurping of this dish will result in missing out on some of the wonderful hidden gems within (eg. the pomegranates, citrus caviar and umami-rich broth). Please, take your time with this dish. The last dish I want to commend is the os. I have no idea what this is actually, or what it means or even the impetus behind it. Avocados! California! Right?!. Imagine a grilled avocado, topped with farro, which is topped with pan-roasted mushrooms (oyster & morel) and garnished with very crispy, slightly charred rice puffs. This dish, despite having no protein, had all the right elements to make me feel like I was enjoying something wholesome. We almost raised the white flag, but couldn resist the BBQ Lengua or the foie gras ice-cream. :)', This place is awesome. Saw some Yelp friends check in and decided to give the place a try. A friend and I came in for dinner around 7pm on a Thursday night. Place is pretty small but also was pretty packed especially given that this is their first week being open! The place definitely gives off an interesting vibe. It's got a dark/romantic/intimate atmosphere with interesting RNB/rap songs playing in the background. I love it. So Mission. It's also very much in line with this new affordable fine dining SF scene (i.e. this place reminded me of The Palace--great food, small place, though this place is definitely more aesthetically pleasing)It's fine dining in the sense that the food is so top notch, but service sometimes feels a little awkward and not super natural yet--I'm sure it'll get better as the waitresses get more comfortable. My friend and I didn't order any alcohol and our waitress expressed some very noticeable disapproval/sadness which was a little awkward lol.I'll let my photos speak for themselves, but here's a brief rundown of the dishes we had:Chips--yummy crisp sweet tangy tortilla chips that went super well with the fish roe on top! truly a burst of citrusy goodnessHielo--huckleberry & lemon lime ice with pop rocks!! such a fun dishCrudo--basically tasted like Japanese sashimi but better. the jalapeno added a nice pop of flavor, the base of the dish was also tangy and citrusy. I enjoyed it! Super fresh fishGrano--my friend's favorite and I loved as well .whole grain chicken soup! chicken was a little dry and flavorless but the soup was yum yum with pomegranate seeds!Bistec--YES. My favorite. my god it was amazing . The lengua mole was so soft and tender. Came with a caramelized onion that went really well with a citrusy avocado thick sauceChoc--blood orange ice cream with chocolate and coffee flavored stuff; pretty goodFoie--foie gras ice cream with apple pieces and crumble--felt like a deconstructed apple pie. The ice cream was really good but honestly if you lied and told me it was caramel ice cream I would have believed itDulce--Mexican wedding cookie was super soft and yummy & the mango gummy was an excellent end!At $57/person, I think this place is a huge bargain. They do automatically tack in the 18% service tax into your bill so be aware of that when you're paying. I'm not typically a fan of Mexican food, but this didn't even feel like Mexican food. Honestly such a phenomenal experience. Each dish was beautifully created and so, so creative. It's been a long time since I've had such an exciting, interesting meal. I left feeling full enough, though I could see how someone might still be hungry since the only entree is the beef tongue. tldr; super cheap tasting menu why wouldn't you go? get in before they get big! service could be better but food at the price is amazing., 'Amazing! Blind tasting and we loved everything we got! Do get the wine pairing with the six course meal. The service was impeccable and the food was scrumptious! The space is beautiful and relaxing. Fun treat to try now! You deserve it!', 'Very underwhelmed by this place. I was excited to try a Mexican tasting menu but the seven course tasting we had failed to satiate my palette and stomach.The entire meal felt like an appetizer, and I would gladly pay more for the many other better tasting and filling menus or omakase in the city. Chef may have been trying too hard in trying to establish dominant flavors into single bite size courses.In addition, there were two waitresses that would rotate and ask me the same question every 15 minutes. Probably due to a lack of communication and being a new restaurant.Suggested improvements: Your value proposition is very unique in that you are probably one of the very few Mexican tastings in the area. Would really work on finding the correct portion size and/or expand your course offering. Would recommend even just having your staff try your tasting course and have them give their anonymous honest feedback.I like the concept, but a lot of work to be done.', Starting on a good note: wine choices were good; desserts were tasty and interesting. The rest was very under-whelming. And Mexican?! hardly. I can think of so many ways that they could've created cool, modern Mexican cuisine ...and they didn't. Was the only restaurant meal that I've ever had where I was craving a taco or hamburger afterwards!, 'Omg this place is amazing! My husband and I have been lucky enough to live in Paris and enjoy great eateries such as Chateaubriand and Frenchie.. This place shares the same ambience and passion as both of these. We had the opportunity to sit at the chefs table and watch the chefs assemble great dishes right before our eyes. The whole team is impeccable, it is a small group of young professionals, driven and humble, giving it 110%. AMAZING!', Great food with an awesome atmosphere. The chefs have big name credentials (Sons & Daughters, Noma) and the food takes a unique and surprising turn throughout the tasting. You'll be blown away by each course, and the wine paring was an excellent addition. We'll be back again soon - thank you!, 'Correction: the price per person is $57, plus tax and tip.', We loved this place. The host and waitress were very welcoming with a genuine interest in our well being during the entire dinner. The tasting menu was well thought out, demonstrating delicate textures with lovely flavor profiles, each dish having their own personality. Not to mention all tastes were beautifully plated. Wine pairing was spot on. And, at fifty seven dollars per person for 8 tastes, this is a phenomenal value. The ambiance was perfect: dark, romantic, white table cloths, tufted leather banquettes, interesting art hanging on the walls, juxtaposed with fun/upbeat rap and 80's music playing in the background. Love that.We had a fantastic evening and are excited to return again. Thanks Californios!, They don't give you a menu and then pass off tongue as if it's regular beef. Avoid at all cost., It was a pretty fun experience. We've done a few other tasting menus (commis, four seasons, aziza) and this one I felt was excellent individually but not as a cohesive whole. I couldn't hear the waiters say what was in the dishes and when they handed out menus at the end it was just single words - not descriptions. Would have been nice to hear more about the dishes instead of now forever wondering what we ate.Cute bathroom. Pretentious in the slightest but no too unapproachable.Love love loved the beef tongue we were served it was fantastic., 'Belonging to the past and yet still the future. Outstanding menu...filled with love and grace.', 'We had an amazing dinner there. This place is wonderful--a great, intimate setting, delicious inventive food with great wine pairings (definitely get the wine pairing with your tasting menu!), but the real standout was the amazing service. Nathan not only took great care of us while we were there, but when he heard we were visiting from Boston, he gave us two written itineraries of things to do with restaurant recommendations etc. Above and beyond on all fronts!', 'A sense of calm overtakes you the instant you enter thru the doors and it only gets better from there.', Just like a lot of reviews, Californios is a great surprise. It's a small dimly lit place that plays really close attention to its diners. There is no menu, and you go in blind, hoping for the best. It's kind of nice not having to worry about it actually. They do ask you for any dietary restrictions and accommodate. The palate cleanser was actually the biggest surprise as it had pop rocks in it. Each dish was unique and delicious in its own way.So why not the 5 stars? I noticed that the table next to us got 2 extra dishes- when all you can do is a set menu. Upon talking to the host, its basically upto the chef, who gets what, and when. So if you're a regular, you may get more...but for the first time, you get less. That was kinda off putting, but I will be back I suppose. Also, the hardcore rap that sometimes plays with their mix is so out of place. I have nothing against the music, in fact I was shazzaming it to get it later, I just thought it was out of place for such a upscale joint., We were all set to absolutely love this restaurant. The ambience, spot on. The service, dead to rights. And the first three courses, perfect: the play on tortillas light and airy with a bit of caviar; the citrus ice with pop rocks, whimsical in a good way; the flavorful meat broth with bits of chicken sous vide and herbs, memorable. The jarring note was actually the main course: a browned whole tongue that was tough and unpleasantly chewy. It was an arrogant choice for a restaurant that gives you none of your own. Many people, including me, just can't abide the texture of an entire piece of tongue and it looks disgusting sitting plopped there on your plate. This one dish made the otherwise delightful evening one from which nightmares are born. My mind cringes at the image of that piece of meat (with only a dab of guacamole and a bit of onion to distract the eye). The three desserts that followed, including a glorious fois gras ice cream could not resurrect the evening for us., 'I am truly on the fence about this place. On the one hand, everything we got was tasty... on the other, it wasn so fantastic that I planning another trip unlike other tasting menus in the city that I can wait to get back to again.Overall, it was a good night. The ambience is nice. The staff is truly friendly. The sommelier was the best of the lot - very informative, professional, and made some interesting pairings. We really enjoyed the wines and her service. Our main waitress was very nice, though felt somewhat unprofessional and too casual for this place. The dishes were mostly described by the kitchen staff who brought them out, and it was always clear for us what the dishes were, unlike some comments here.The food was very good and beautifully plated, and while I enjoyed it, there wasn really one dish that made me feel that I must have it again... the soup likely came closest. The tongue was interesting and I love mole so liked the seasoning of it, but still not likely something I feel the need to come back for (neither does it make me want to come back to see what the chef will do next). The dishes were exactly as described by others and pictured so I won describe each in detail, but unlike some here, I just wasn wowed. In addition, though I rarely rate a place on quantity as I think restaurant portions are absurdly huge, because this was a 6 course tasting menu, I had eaten light that day, as I do whenever I do a tasting menu because I want to make sure I do not get too full and miss the opportunity to enjoy the full x-course meal. This is the only time I have left a tasting menu not feeling completely full. That isn necessarily a bad thing, as I stated, I don like feeling stuffed or wasting my money paying for too-large portion sizes. However, I just wasn fully satisfied after this meal. I think that was probably a combination of the portions and partly just not feeling really satisfied palate-wise. Maybe my expectations were just too high after the media build-up.Re cost: It is a good price for a tasting menu in the city - $57 + another $35 for the wine pairings, gratuity is added on automatically at 18%.', 'A wonderful experience. From the moment you step through the doors you know you are in for a treat. The room is elegant, lounge, and hip. The seating very comfortable and offers room to breathe, relax and take your surroundings. The surprisingly calm open kitchen, the Wes Anderson Book, the conceptual modern art all of these remind you to pause, reflect and open your senses. The whole experience challenges you to move away from the rush and engage in the moment. It is akin to a rabbit hole that invites you to partake in a Mexican meal that is highly conceptual and very delicious. Our meal began with a reimagined nacho. You might be saying to yourself that nachos aren really Mexican, and you would be 100% correct. By placing the nachos up front in his tasting menu chef Cantu is letting you know that he thinking about the flavors of Mexican cuisine. He is not confining himself to the expected. He raises your hopes that he will engage your senses, emotions *and* intellect.There is always a risk that the intellect will overtake the emotional and sensual. On the night we were there, watching as the balancing act played out from course to course was exhilarating and almost entirely successful.Chef Cantu is a man to watch and his Californios is a Mexican restaurant unlike any other in the Bay Area.This is a must go. Get there before the crowd does and get in before the buzz.', 'I guess I could be a purist and never give 5 stars to any place, but if a restaurant deserves 5 stars, this is certainly among them. Note that this is definitely a foodie place so don take your friends there who are not into finely prepared and beautifully executed tasting menus, with small bites of outrageusly good food. I would not know how to describe all the different dishes and their flavors but let just say that the celery granita had pomengranite seeds that burst in your mouth along with pop rocks....and it was heavenly! A beautiful piece of Muscovy duck that trumps most steaks you have had. A delicious foie gras ice cream that most people would love if they did not know that foie gras was in the preparation. And the menu changes every night but takes inspiration from Mexican cooking, although you will not recognize this as any Mexican food you know. The wine pairing was only $35 (it says $45 online) and well worth it! Definitely take Lyft Line there since parking is difficult.', 'My mind was blown. Every dish is truly unique and inspired. This restaurant completely transcends the Michelin formula. The flavors are strong and unexpected. The food errors on the side of fun over pretentious.Staff is delightful and upbeat. Something about the restaurant reminds me of Commis back when Commis first opened, but less formal and the dishes at Californios are more audacious and creative.This is my new all-time favorite restaurant. At the end of the meal, our entire party made reservations for the next week.You must go.', 'Bravo to this creative, original and artistic group of chefs led by Chef Cantu for this gastronomic experience! Courteous and professional service too! The bites of food were each a burst of deliciousness, surprising, refined and unique. Everything was extremely clean, well-executed with attention to detail. My favorites were the amazingly flavorful and complex smokey refreshing hamachi with a touch of heat, the chicken consomme with juicy bursts of pomegranate, the who knew potatoes could taste so fantastic soft potatoes, and the succulent, rich duck breast savory reduction with pickled fennel. The desserts were interesting and super refined and delicate. The ONLY downside was we were still hungry (we are women with normal appetites) after the meal. We would like this restaurant to succeed and urge them to increase the portions just a tad. For $75/person + wine you should not leave hungry! With this critical change, this restaurant will please anyone who decides to spend their evening here and a 5-star experience.', 'I went back and forth on whether or not to give this place 5 stars and decided on 4. It was a very very good meal, and the service was great too. However, I continued to be stumped by what we were eating. Each of the different chefs or servers who brought our food talked so fast, and when I asked if I could get some sort of menu at the end so I knew about all the cool stuff I was eating, I was informed I would. Then, as you may have seen in other posts, you get an highly stylized menu with one-word descriptions of each course. That is NOT what I wanted. I wanted to know WHAT was in the fish course and the sauce for the duck, etc. That left me pretty disappointed.That being said, Il try to piece together the courses from my memory and othersposts:Course 1: tortilla chips with fish eggs and maybe some spicy sauce (a little dot on the edge of the chip)?Course 2: oysters in a half shellCourse 3: Celery granita with kiwi pudding (palate cleanser) and pop rocks!Course 4: some type of fish crudo with chili oil (excellent - one of my favorites)Course 5: chicken soup with pomegranate. The chicken had an interesting, almost steak-y texture. Perhaps sous vide? I loved the rich broth.Course 6: three potatoes - something pureed, something in a chip form and one other variant. Course 7: Duck breast with shiso sauce, fennel and served with sour tortillas and some type of butter/spread. Very good.Course 8: I a little hazy on this, but some type of ice cream I believe, with a goat cheese/goat milk? foam. Delicious.Course 9: Foie gras ice cream with hazelnut crumble and caramelized banana. Yum!!They finished off the meal with three small candies/treats: a pate de fruit, a cookie and a caramel.All in all, a great tasting menu for a very reasonable price.', This place is outstanding! Chef Val is doing incredible work. He is spearheading the direction of Mexican cuisine, and taking it to a level of creativity and class that it always deserved.This place truly is a special gem in SF. From the colorful yet dark themed paintings, to the ASAP Rocky & Yeezy filled playlist, it really is a remarkable experience.Get the wine pairing! The beverage director is fearlessly creative and selects some awesome wines and beers to go along with the dishes.I'll be back soon!, 'So awesome!!!! Great addition to the mission!!!!! Great service and the food was unique and tasty!!!! Loved it I would for sure go back again....', 'wow, Val and team really REPRESENTED. The tasting menu subtly built upon itself. As simple as some of the items may have been, the magic was found in the details. He really makes flavors go a long way. The service was perfect and everyone was very knowledgeable which is extremely important in good table service. I recommend Californios to everyone.', Do yourself a favor, and go. Now. Before it's a difficult reservation. Before it's so pricey you can't afford it. It's an incredibly personal restaurant with amazing staff and absolutely lovely decor. All the little touches are amazing. The food was brilliant. If you're someone who can completely turn the reins over to the chef and allow yourself to be surprised, you won't be disappointed. Was every dish perfect? No, but most were. While not inexpensive, the tasting menu and wine pairings seemed a bargain for the quality. I absolutely loved it!, 'I discovered Californios via the Eater Map and was mildly curious to see what they had going on there...particularly that foie gras vanilla ice cream everyone takes photos of. When the opportunity presented itself, my husband and I wandered out to the Mission to give it a shot.As you may already know, Californios has a set menu of 12 dishes that range from sweet to savory to heavy in protein, but sourced with all local and organic ingredients for $75 per person (the price just recently went to $75 from $65). The menu seems to change quite frequently in terms of what in season, so to make this a little bit more meaningful, Il just highlight some of things we had that night.Favorite dishes:- Celery root apple granita with kiwi- In-house made sliced bread with flaxseed served with a house made chicken stock soup aged 5 days with parsnip and turnip- Sourdough tortillas with house made butter- Sonoma duck served with a shiso reduction and pico de gallo- Foie gras vanilla ice cream served with peanut brittle and bananaAll five dishes completely nailed it. My husband was a big fan of the granita and duck, and I was seriously drooling over the bread and tortillas. The duck was served Japanese robata style and had a delicious smoky flavor to it. And let talk about the foie gras ice cream. Absolutely no over-the-top foie gras taste, you get a SUPER rich and buttery vanilla ice cream taste instead. It pure genius.Dishes that we were meh on:- Yellowtail with serrano chili oil- Oyster with jicama- Chawanmushi with caviar and blue corn tortilla chipsThe yellowtail wasn cut evenly and in fairly large pieces, so it was a little bit more than a mouthful when trying to eat it. The oyster and chawanmushi weren over the top, and the caviar on the chawanmushi seemed to overdo the umami taste I think it was going for.Service wise, Californios did an amazing job with spacing out our dishes in a even way, and the person in charge of the wine program (my husband had the wine pairing with his meal) did an amazing job explaining each glass that was being poured with the upcoming dishes. Sitting at the bar was also a good experience and we got to see how hard the guys in the kitchen were working to put together some beautifully plated dishes.At $75, Californios is definitely on the pricey side (more when you add in the drink program), and it definitely not going to be the type of experience where youl feel like you need to be rolled out of the restaurant from eating too much. The plate sizing is delicate and meant to give you a solid few bites which focuses on quality and not quantity. I definitely enjoyed my time at Californios, especially how much creativity and hard work they pour into each dish!', I don't usually write reviews unless I have an exceptional experience. Californios is a gem of a restaurant. The food was nothing short of art and every dish surpassed expectations. It is an intimate experience that is sure to please. The wine was perfectly paired with every course. If you haven't been already, go as soon as possible., Californios is a truly stand out dining experience in the Mission. It's a small, intimate space with impeccable service - some of the best I've had. These people really know how to make someone feel welcome. The tasting menu is about 8 courses, and you absolutely have to do the wine paring. I found some new favorites here. I don't often review but was prompted to get on yelp and give this a full 5 star review. Delicious., 'Came on Valentine Day and had a fantastic experience. Highlights were the foie gras ice cream and the hamachi...even the chips and salsa were great. Nothing truly knocked our socks off, but it was really good.', What an amazing dining experience! I could go into all of the wonderful things about this place, but truthfully it's an experience that you should have for yourself. This is a complete dining experience. The food was wonderful, the service, the decor, a wonderful meal meant to take your time and enjoy. I feel like today, so many people eat and run - people are so busy photographing their food rather than tasting it and enjoying it. At Californios you feel like you are having a private dinner party- enjoying your food, your wine and your company. If you don't want to take the time to sit back and relax and take it all in - this place might not be for you, but you will absolutely be missing out! BRAVO Californios team! I will be back and I will recommend to my friends and family. A new SF restaurant not to be missed., 'A very good experience at Californios...Through my palette, I enjoyed a culinary journey with about 9-10 courses...The stand-outs for me were the following:-Chips and Salsa - a single, gourmet chip with a surprise of roe -Intermezzo - Kiwi granita with Pop-Rocks...subtley sweet with a surprise, this was great for cleansing the palette-Fish, which was prepared in a ceviche-style, with bright and vibrant flavors.-Potatoes-Three-Ways: Potato puree, with a baked potato and then topped off with a potato chip -Duck and Fennel Salad - the duck had a fantastic flavor, more like beef and definitely the best duck Ie ever had in my life (that coming from someone who doesn even like duck!). The bright flavors from the fennel was a balance to the richness of the meat.-Bread and Butter - this was a sour tortilla, which was almost like a griddle cake with good flavor from the char...the house-made butter was very good.-Dessert - we had three courses of desserts: First course: Hazelnut Flan with Goats Milk Foam and Seasonal Citrus - I really liked this since it was almost like a palate cleanser with its smoothness and subtle flavors along with fresh touches from the fruit. Second course: Foie Gras Ice Cream - wow! So amazing - this was rich and decadent with perfect texture...it was perfectly sweet and the bit of chocolate sauce added a hint of additional richness and earthiness to the flavor...a caramelized banana piece also completed the dish. Third course: A plate of Dulce: 2 Coconut Cookies, 2 Mango Gelee, 2 White Chocolate Caramels - everything was very good and well done.I really appreciated the thought that went into each plate, whether I liked it or not. There was a course of oysters, which I not a fan of (but I assume if you love oysters, you may love it) and there was a course of chicken soup with pomegranate that I really didn like...the texture was a bit tough and seemed as if it were raw.Overall, I enjoyed my experience here and would visit again. Considering the tasting menu was a bargain compared to most others, it was another reason to enjoy this place.The customer service was excellent!', 'Amazing service. Great food. Could not have had a better experience. Loved every single dish except the main dish. I thought that one was a bit bland. Overall, had an amazing night.', I'd really like to give 3.5 stars, but I'll err on the high side.First the pluses:Food was greatService was greatExperience was great (we were there for almost 3 hours)My one drawback which we keep me from recommending this place (unless I heavily caveated on the following):The portions were ridiculously smallI get being inventive, I get fine dining, I get highlighting textures and flavors, etc., but one course had a single head of asparagus, another had 1 chip, another had 1 small potatoe. The duck was fantastic. Too bad it was 3 small bites (and I was cutting the pieces small to stretch out the food).I think the chef felt sorry for us (2 guys) and sent over an extra sourdough tortilla for us (which was excellent by the way) because we had tore into the one they had brought.In the end, and in keeping with the Mexican theme, we got a mexican hotdog on the corner of Mission and 22nd after we had left the restaurant. Delicious..., My party of 4 came on a Saturday night at 6PM and there was only one other party present. By the end of our meal, the place was basically full. This place is tiny and only seats 30 people so be sure to make a reservation. They said the tasting would take 2.5 hrs but we were done in 2. Also, had I not know that this was a Mexican restaurant, I wouldn't have been able to tell considering a number of the dishes were heavily Asian-inspired.$75 tasting menu, $45 6 wine pairings, mandatory 18% tip. -Tortilla chip w/ roe - too salty-Oyster - fresh-Asparagus w/ yogurt - i wish there was more of this-Celery granita with pop rocks - refreshes your palette and definitely gets you excited for the following course-Smoked hamachi - haven't had this before. twas delicious!-Potatoes - potato puree, baked potato, potato chip. what a versatile ingredient-Tortilla - think pupusa with no filling. meh-Duck + Fennel Salad - duck was cooked to perfection.-Dessert - easily my favorite part of the meal. 3 courses! Goats milk ice cream and citrus - light and smooth. acidity of the citrus cut through the creaminess of the goats milk well. Foie Gras Ice Cream - you can't taste the foie gras but it definitely enhanced the creaminess of the ice cream.  A plate of bite-sized sweets: cookies, guava gelee, caramel. The portions were so tiny I didn't even feel guilty afterWhen it was originally $57, it was absolutely a steal. At the current price of $75, it's definitely pricey. At the end of the meal, I was content, which means my guy friends were still hungry so we made a trip to El Farolito 2 blocks away. Overall, excellent quality, but quantity needs work., 'I like that there nothing but a very subtle C on the door of this place. You feel like youe part of a well-kept secret. We had a fantastic dinner here; almost every course (11 total) was a total hit, but there were a couple misses. Boy was it pricey too--you really have to justify spending like this! Worth it for a special occasion but I wouldn make this a regular go-to spot.Once inside, Californios feels like your distant rich uncle Upper East Side living room, complete with bookshelves and real books. It dark and it plush. A little sparse, but they are new and still seem to be finalizing the look (I commented on a gold skull they had at the entrance and they just gotten it the day before). THE WAIT: None at 8:00pm on a Thursday for four. They don crowd the tables and give you plenty of room, so even with the large space, there were relatively few tables compared to some restaurants that barely give you elbow room between tables.THE SERVICE: Great! The staff were friendly, knowledgable, and made the vibe more casual and comfortable (the price tag and the decor would otherwise have pointed to a more pretentious place). THE COST: Pricey! $100 for the tasting, $45 for the drink pairing, all before tax/tip.THE FOOD: There no pressure of looking at a menu and deciding. The tasting menu is set every night, and they save each course as a surprise (though they will ask about dietary restrictions, allergies, etc). Once your party is settled, the courses start coming out and gradually work their way up into richer, more filling small plates. It meant to be an 8 course, but you have your amuse-bouche and extra desserts at the end, so the 11 courses works out to a perfect amount of food in my mind.THE BEST: Huevo (sashimi), Pollo (in farro broth), Sable (swordfish in garlic sauce), Pato (steak), Foie (ice cream).THE WORST: Papas (custard), Dulces (cookies).Course 1: Botana (nachos and salsa) - 4 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/cali43_A bit oily on the nachos, but thick with a subtle crunch, comes unique flavors on top.Course 2: Hielo (oysters) - 4 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/cali43_Fresh & tasty!Course 3: A-chile (celery pudding) - 4.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/cali43_I usually hate celery but liked this! A good mix of salty and refreshing fruit flavors.Course 4: Huevo (sashimi) - 5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/cali43_The most fresh sashimi Ie had, with great subtle flavors, hints of savory and spice. Course 5: Pollo (chicken in a farro-infused broth, with bread) - 5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/cali43_bread: yelp.com/biz_photos/cali43_We LOVED the flavor of the broth, and the chicken was incredibly tender. The bread was thick and grainy but could have been Course 6: Papas (custard) - 3 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/cali43_The least impressive dish of the night. The custard was flavorless and the texture too stiff.Course 7: Sable (swordfish in garlic sauce) - 5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/cali43_Amazingly strong garlic sauce!Course 8: Pato (steak, with tortillas) - 5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/cali43_tortillas: yelp.com/biz_photos/cali43_tortillas cross-section: yelp.com/biz_photos/cali43_Fantastic in all aspects.Course 9: Verbena (their version of tres leches) - 4.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/cali43_Refreshing, light, tasty dessert. But the scoop on top is a cream and not ice cream as we thought.Course 10: Foie (foie gras ice cream, caramelized banana) - 5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/cali43_The best savory ice cream Ie ever had. Texture and flavor all work flawlessly together.Course 11: Dulces (biscuit, passionfruit, toffee) - 3.5 starspic: yelp.com/biz_photos/cali43_Not the best way to end the meal. None of the three cookies were very impressive, but it was a nice free last dessert.', 'Amazing, and great for my vegetarian hubby! They brought out freshly foraged veggies for him and just dug potatoes were also served. I love these adjectives and the flavor of everything was just amazing. It not often that you find a place great for both vegetarians and meat eaters and where the veggie meal is thoughtful and tasty and not just a bowl of risotto or some veggies on a plate.my favorite was the sashimi, the warm tortillas, and the buttery fish that was so delicate. Totally worth the price! We ordered a bottle of pinot that went well with everything, but next time we might try the wine pairing!', Great Service, Nice Place, Tasty food, TINY portion and Expensive.We had a 9 curse diner or something like that and we spend like almost 3 hours there mostly drinking and chatting. I'm Mexican and i've been in a lot of restaurant from Fancy one to simple ones and I'm always looking for tasty and well done food. I think this place was a little to inventive and pretentious in terms of the food.Chips and salsa was ridicuisly small and not chips and salsa at all. The asparagus with a drop of dressing or whatever was a delicious Joke. I felt like in a taste room. I must say the Gordita was the only Mexican thing.I'm looking forward to find I high end Restaurant with Mexican Cuisine, this is just not there. Too bad employees were great., My partner was celebrating a birthday and I wanted to treat him to a special dinner. Originally I had booked at one of the classic top dining destinations in the city but as the day drew closer I thought it might be fun to try a new place. In the end this was a good instinct as he (and I) were extremely pleased about almost every aspect of our experience at Californios. To be honest the evening did not get off to an auspicious start. We arrived by car on a Saturday night at 8pm and finding a parking spot was time-consuming and stressful. We called the restaurant and they gave us a few suggestions but we definitely wished we'd taken an Uber. Once inside, seated on the gorgeous caramel-colored leather banquette we ordered the tasting menu with wine pairing and the evening was smooth sailing from there on out.The space is intimate but warm and sophisticated at the same time. The service is personal yet not intrusive. The place is run by a husband and wife chef/front of house team along with the wife's sister who has chosen the exquisite wine list. The food was a parade of small plates with a Mexican theme but very contemporary and Californian. It changes according to what's in the market so I won't go into detail about each course. Suffice it to say it was all delicious and very fairly priced. I think they are barely breaking even on the wine pairing.My final word: eat here soon. The prices are bound to increase and it's anyone's guess if they can maintain these high standards. We had a wonderful evening and recommend the restaurant very highly., 'Amazing food, good service in a classy restaurant. But the music !!!! : very bad choice : loud and boring music.', 'My husband & I really liked this place. There were some lovely dishes and flavor combinations. I have a hard time calling this place a Mexican restaurant though since many of the techniques were decidedly Japanese or more reminiscent of European haute cuisine. But regardless of what you label Californios, it a great addition to the SF food scene. I love the fact that the bill is all-in as well.', 'Wow! What an unexpected and wonderful experience. Food, wine and service were impeccable.', 'Amazing service, wine and cuisine !', 'We were a part of 6 celebrating some shared birthdays. We were greeted at the door with complementary sparkling wine and it set a tone of exceptional service throughout the evening. The food was wonderful;; creative and prepared with such nuanced care. All 8 dishes were different from one another and quite novel. A terrific experience and great value for the quality and care of both food and service.', I can't say enough good things about our experience here. the food was fantastic - just consistently excellent. and the service was arguably even better. go. get the pairing. do it now., I'm absolutely floored by the dining experience here!This is the kind of food that keeps you thinking about it days after the meal is over.In my mind, next to Saison, this is possibly the best restaurant in SF at this moment. I cannot recommend Californios highly enough., I've been here twice in the past week for the tasting menu, and I am going to come here as often as I can before they get a Michelin star and the prices go up. You cannot do better than their tasting menu and wine pairing at $75 and $45 respectively. The ingredients and preparations are amazing, and I think it's only a matter of time before they are on par with 3-star restaurants like Benu, French Laundry, and Meadowood. Service is also extremely good, with the chefs bringing out the courses and providing in-depth descriptions for each.I usually do not get wine pairings, but I think that it is critical here. Each pairing was perfect; I have never had a succession of such flawless wines, beer, and sake. The price is insane.In closing, I'd say that I preferred this place to Saison and found it to be on par with the likes of Lazy Bear. It actually reminds me a lot of Saison when it opened as a pop-up 5 years ago (and was charging $75 for the tasting menu). Trust me, go now., 'Wow! Definitely on par and perhaps even better than many of the premier tasting menus Ie had, including Per Se and Daniel in NY. I can believe it only $75 for the entire tasting menu, but that bound to change as soon as this place registers as it should.There wasn a single dish that I could pick at in terms of preparation or the taste being somehow off. The SF chronicle was whining about lack of passion while admitting the food was superb, but either that changed or the critic has been taking his support for legalization of herbs too seriously and hitting the pipe a bit too hard. There is so much going on in every dish, even snacks, that it hard to imagine that it was executed so well. Some of my favorites were the yellowtail, potato purd9e, halibut with charred greens, asparagus and the sorbets. Left feeling more than satisfied and only wishing I could come back the next day. Well done.', This place is destined to get a Michelin star. Incredible flavors, beautiful presentation, and excellent service. Just wow. It's now my top recommendation to guests who want to splurge., 'Absolutely fantastic in every regard. Food, decor, service, wine list (Pinot from Sta. Rita Hills - yum!). Even the noise level was perfect - so many restaurants are way too loud these days. Among the very best restaurant experiences of my life - seriously.'|1
15|commonwealth-san-francisco|What do you get when you combine $5 parking in the Mission, with the best fine dining experience in SF (on the cheap), with background music like Outkast? The Answer: Commonwealth! This place truly lived up to the hype!I called ahead to eat there on the first Friday open but their tables were booked. The hostess was kind enough to get us 2 bar stools which turned out to be perfect (and better than the tables)!We were served an amuse bouche of kombu dusted potato chips, with malt vinegar espuma which were the most delicious chips I have had in a long time. We ordered both the Padron Peppers with Goat Cheese and the Crispy Pig Ears (which should be called Chicharrones) and both impressed but the latter definitely stold the show. I was torn between the Garden Tomatoes and Basil Salad and the Compressed Watermelon Salad, so we decided to order both. Each of the salads was delicious in their own right. The presentation of the Garden Tomato Salad on the slab of stone made it seem much more enticing, aside from that they were tied in my book of Delicious. For the main course My Man went with the Guinea Hen and Spot Prawns which gave me total plate envy and I ordered the thing cooked on hay (can you tell I loved My Man's better than mine). The dessert was good but the one with Cinnamon (forgot the name) was FABULOUS! No seriously the balance of chocolate, cinnamon, and creamy marshmallow was simply perfect. I loved that at the end of the meal you are asked to choose a non-profit which proceeds of your meal can go to. Yummy and socially conscious count me in!!, 'I a bit biased here because I love their commitment to supporting some super rad nonprofits.. Maybe that not a bias? Can you be smitten with a business model?I left the soft opening (soft opening!) sated and grateful, inspired to attempt gnocchi at home like Jason Fox.. puffball soft, seared and sprinkled with mushrooms, parmesan and truffle oil.. Dude. OMG. (Around $10-$13)It was the first night, so I felt like a turd taking too many photos, but I did get one of the most gorgeous dish, the pressed watermelon salad with herbs and white soy sauce and some kind of magical candy made from seaweed.. So yum. Can wait to go back. And park in their parking lot cause it like that. Yep. Awesome.', One of the most hyped restaurant openings of the year. Does it live up to the hype? yes. I went there for a soft opening and I came away impressed and happy. Commonwealth had several challenges, foremost being location. Mission Street has occupants, many of whom will never step foot in Commonwealth. However, instead of building some fortified, douchtastic rooftop bar-dool, the restaurant owners acknowledged their surroundings. The parking lot isn't a chain-link, barbed wire fortress; the walls of the restaurant are frosted glass so you can see the movement of the street. Part of the ceiling has been left open for a view of the eaves. And of course, the famous donut sign that was discovered on the exterior has been left, as a nod to the restaurant's past when the building sold a dozen donuts for a dollar. In effect, Commonwealth is embracing the history of Mission street and yet, moving it to something different. Why can't we have fine dining here? good for them.What's good? the gnocchi. I would like a swimming pool of this stuff. warm with truffle oil, mushrooms and fresh corn. I split a bowl but next time- one for myself. Also: the compressed watermelon with wild greens that taste like summer and nori created in a way that I can't describe. Like chips, but sorry, you'll just have to order it. words fail me here.Also- the *squash soup* green, unapologetically green, full flavored, cold soup with fried blossoms like tempura. fluke crudo- I liked this, but I think it was the wrong fish for the accompanying gel and tarragon. Or maybe the wrong temperature? Maybe I'm just not familiar with fluke.hanger steak- very good, but served with wheatgrass juice/sauce which completely overpowered the steak for me. I don't think wheatgrass should be used in cooking. The flavor is just too strong and bitter and causes too many people to gag. (I understand the cleverness behind it (circle of life) but no- I hope they take off the sauce and just serve the steak on its own.Desserts. to me, this is the best part. These are Michelin quality desserts. You really see the Coi influcence and normally you would see these types of desserts at the end of an 8 course meal. But these! These! $8 and gorgeous.White Russian. Meringue, milk, ice cream heaven.Mille-feuille: the fanciest s'more you've ever had. Honey ice cream, marshmallow, graham cracker. happiness.ok, overall beautiful restaurant, great service and lovely concept: (you can read more about it on their site if you are unfamiliar with them or Mission Street Food). needless to say, I'm a fan! and I am coming back., 'Date & Time: Tuesday August 10, 2010 @ 5:30pmCompany: MichaelCrowd: Local Foodies w/ Sophisticated PalatesVibe: EnergeticMusic: PM Dawn Set Adrift on Memory BlissDecor: Urban Charm.

It happened to be tonight, the opening night of Commonwealth. Given the concept and the chef, we decided to give it a shot. We were so happy we did.The food was fancy and tasty, without trying too hard. The prices are beyond reasonable. We think they should ratchet up the prices or ratchet down the portions so this business can survive long-term and become the neighborhood staple that it deserves to be.', Yep! They live up to the hype! I went on opening night and service and food were spot on. No hiccups for this newbie restaurant.My favorites were the gnocchi small plate, small hen and spot prawn entree, and the cinammon adult s'more (I can't remember the name). I wish I had ordered the watermelon small plate too. The table next to ours was ooh-ing over theirs., I really enjoyed our meal on the second day of officially opening. The service was very friendly and comfortable, and I usually don't care about service. And everything we ordered was at least good, if not excellent. The most successful dishes were the gnocchi and the spot prawns and chicken (the sauce was delicious). It wasn't 100% perfect--the skate seemed oddly cut and not coked as much as usual, and the squid stuffed with bone marrow and 'tamarind pork' had a small bone in it, but tasted like delicious, hamburger-stuffed squid. It's an excellent value for the price, and I am excited I can get truly inventive cooking at a reasonable price., wow, i am gushing. 'compressed' watermelon, nori, and tofu salad, truffle corn gnocchi, skate with broccoli and sea beans, and cardamom marshmallow cinnamon filo chocolate ganache burnt carmel mille feuille or fancy smore. yes a mouthful and slightly gimmicky - in the best possible sense. and have they really only been open for 3 days? makes me rethink my decision to avoid benu for the first month or two of madness and totally respect their particular practice or training (or natural talents). i highly suggest heading out to commonwealth to check out the new goodness. the hostess (who seamlessly dealt with our evaporated opentable reservation) the waitstaff (who managed our eating pickiness and pecularities), the chef (who jeff was ready to go and thank personally at meal end), and the whole staff (who are committed to their non-profit philanthropy) did an amazing job, and will surely to continue to do so. go. enjoy. eat. devour. gush. vote for your charitable cause of choice. discuss. bask in the awesomeness of your position being able to eat this food while also supporting their benevolent business model. and repeat! eeeeps is the day after tomorrow too soon?, I lack to words to describe how much we enjoyed opening night here. We arrived at 9PM, half hour early for your 9:30 reservations, only to find that open table lost our reservation, but they would do their best to have us seated as soon as possible. So we mulled the menu over in the parking lot with our apology wine.We finally sat down, our very kind waiter explained the menu, recommenced dishes and was on his way. We already knew what we wanted, because just like MSF, it's much easier to just say one of everything. (disclaimer, I think we actually skipped 2 of the meat entrees).Each course came out at the perfect time, with a wonderful explanation and a new set of silverware. I swear I must have used at least 5 different forks and knifes through out the night. There was not a single thing that was not gushed over. But the real star was the gnocchi, anyone who doesn't try it is a fool. By the end of the end of the night we were the perfect amount of full, and thankfully had room to try the desserts, which should not be missed. All in all, I think we had the most amazing food for some of the most affordable prices., Dinner here was simply marvellous: it is perhaps among the best meals I've ever had in San Francisco. The restaurant is only five days old, yet it already seems to be hitting its stride as its kitchen sends out confident, innovative, yet reasonably priced masterpieces.After meekly asking the hostess this Friday night if there might be a table available for two without a reservation, she promptly and generously seated us at the bar. Unlike many other restaurants that feature bar seating, the countertops at Commonwealth are wide and comfortable -- there was to be no awkward contortions to get at our food. The bar stools are also quite pleasant to sit in.The menu is small, but very creative. The food is clearly based on New American classics, but showcases a heavy dose of molecular gastronomy and Japanese ingredients. After ordering a starter of the tomato salad, we were given Commonwealth's equivalent of the bread course: house made potato chips with seaweed flakes. Neither salty nor heavy, these were the perfect palate warmer without sitting too heavily in my stomach.The tomato salad was genius. Full of heirloom tomatoes, five different kinds of basil, black olive crumble, smoked bread, some sea salt, and a deliciously light and creamy Idiazabal cheese, all of the flavours came together to produce a near orgasmic bite. The salad was also served on a piece of slate, which added a very unique visual dynamic to the food. We both ordered the guinea hen with spot prawn as our main dish. Featuring spinach, artichoke, and a chocolate-amond emulsion, it was spot-on, delicious, and hearty. Plus, unlike many high-end restaurants here in San Francisco, the portion was actually hearty!Dessert was out of this world. A cinnamon mille-feuille with a fresh, homemade cardamon marshmallow and burnt honey ice cream. The combination of the slight chewiness of the marshmallow with the savouriness of the ice cream was positively orgasmic! And, as a bonus, our bar seats had a great view of the kitchen, and we could watch the sous-chef preparing the marshmallow. I cannot recommend Commonwealth strongly enough. Run, do not walk, over to Mission Street now!, Food was awesome. Service was pretty good. One of the more memorable meals we had in a long time. Items on the menu are different than other restaurants which is refreshing. Portions are small to medium portions but we love that because with 2 people, you can try more dishes and not feel stuffed. We had the corn custard with uni, squid stuffed with marrow, hen with spotted prawns and lamb tongue. Everything was seasoned perfectly and just really really good! Dessert, the frozen green tea meringue, was out of this world. We finished it so quickly! We should have gotten our own instead of sharing! We'll definitely go back again. They have a small parking lot that you can park for $5.Only complaint is that the tables are too close to each other so there's not much privacy in your conversation., 'Bringing sophisticated, innovative dining to The Mission, Commonwealth provides a wealth of daring gourmet options at prices for the common man.Housed in the Gourmet Ghetto in a space that was formerly El Herradero and before that a doughnut shop, Commonwealth joins 18th Street powerhouses Delfina and Tartine, as well as other destination spots like Maverick, Flour + Water, and Beretta in providing new, upscale dining experiences.Obviously influenced by Catalan superstar Ferrd7n Adrid7 of El Bulli, the chef at Commonwealth uses foams with wild abandon, pairs items of different textures and temperatures deftly, and treats diners to new flavors often.To start, diners are presented with utterly delicious potato chips dusted with kombu (a Japanese spice used in making dashi) with malt vinegar espuma (nitrogen-based foam)--a molecular gastronomy-based dish that most certainly defines umami. Fresh and tasty, the chef complements garden tomatoes with basil, black olive crumble, smoked bread, and idiazabal cheese from the Basque region of Spain. The compressed watermelon accompanied by tofu, nori, cucumber, wild greens, and togarashi (a Japanese 7-spice blend that typically includes red chile flakes, dried orange peel, white sesame seeds, black sesame seeds, nori flakes, poppy seeds and ginger) was so good it disappeared faster than lightning. The soft, light potato gnocchi was accompanied by fresh sweet corn, rich maitake mushrooms, sage, and parmesan reggiano--just deliciousIn addition to the a la carte menu, the tasting menu priced at $60 for six courses (wine pairing only $30 additional) is a fantastic bargain. It provides a low-pressure way to try some really exciting new foods. What more, since the restaurant donates $10 from each tasting menu served to a local food-oriented charity, diners can feel good about eating well.Service is attentive and knowledgeable. The waiter easily fielded questions about the intricate preparations of many of the dishes, and dishes arrived at a pace that was neither too fast, nor too slow. The wine list is small, but reasonably priced with ample selections both by the glass and by the bottle. Corkage is a reasonable (for SF) $15.With innovative preparation, beautiful presentation, and delicious creations, Commonwealth is a standout. Dining at Commonwealth is uncommonly good.', Quintessential San Francisco: eat fluke crudo in txakoli gel for the sake of the hungry. Or in this case: Support SF food bank by dining at Commonwealth (commonwealth contributes part of its proceedings to SF Food bank).But what can I say other than it was a pleasure to be the quintessential san franciscan? What I have to add to the information that was provided in previous yelps: * corkage is $15.* nice wine list.* excellent service. e.g. we were a mixed table in terms of sparkling/still water. we drank oceans and since we weren't drinking out of troughs but out of very beautiful glasses, this translated into about a 1000 refills each. they never got our preference wrong., I have to give Kudos to the Commonwealth team, they're bringing great eats for a very nice price point. In the heart of the Mission, they've built a fine dining experience that somehow seems tucked away from the bustle and grit of the rest of the neighborhood. We came in thinking we'd have to sit at the bar but with a cancellation we were seated right away. After perusing the menu I realized they were doing tastings courses. At $60 for 6 courses and another $30 for wine, I was all over it. On top of that they donate $10 from the menu to the SF Food Bank. Each month they will try and choose another charity to donate to. That's highly respectable. After sitting down you are set up with a bowl of homemade chips and a vinegar foam/espuma and complimentary still or sparkling water. The menu/pairings proceeded as follows:-Summer squash, chilled soup, fried blossoms, vadouvanGruner Vetliner, Familie Bauer, Juche, 2007 Donauland, Austria-Corn custard, sea urchin, chorizo, lobster emulsion, jalapenoChenin Blanc, Charles Bove, 2008 Vouvray-Salt cured foie gras, umeboshi, seaweed briocheRiesling, Eva Fricke, Lorch, 2008 Rheingau-Hanger Steak, summer alliums, enoki mushrooms, wheatgrass jusCabernet Franc, COR Cellars, 2007 Horse Heaven Hills-Plum sorbet, almond granita-Cinnamon mille-feuille, cardamom marshmallow, burnt honey ice creamMalvasia, Los Bermejos, NV Lanzarote, Canary IslandsEverything was delicious. The only thing that didnt sit right with me was a grilled onion with the steak that was too raw and sat on my palate for a while. Other than that, it was a pretty flawless meal. The service was warm, friendly, and their timing was good with a small lull in the middle. I have to say Im impressed that 8/10/2010 produced both Benu and Commonwealth. Two excellent debuts., Always nice to be surprised when you try out a new place, especially when you're not expecting an altogether mind-blowing experience. Commonwealth offers excellent fare at a pretty acceptable price, which I liked. Great interior design, good vibe and a nice touch giving proceeds to the SF food bank. Overall, it's a nice addition to the gritty neighborhood it's in. I'd go back., 'i don get it.The good:- phenomenal gnocchi. must must must order - it melts in your mouth like little pillows of heaven, said my friend.- i told the lamb was unbelievable. shoulde snagged a bite.- i loved my haute caprese, garden tomatoes and basil.- very attentive server.- pretty sure they heavily discounted our bill, so the final price was totally worth the meal. might have heard us complaining about...The interesting:- shiso peppers in some kind of cheese or sour cream-ish sauce. server warned us 1 in 12 shiso peppers is unbearably hot but we all won that game of pepper roulette.- homemade chips felt like Lays and tasted like fish tails. the vinegar foam - sorry, espuma - redeemed them.- sea urchin in lobster emulsion... hmm. ok.The bad:- worst. bathroom art. ever.- the menu on the site isn quite what they had. friends got excited about things we couldn actually order.- extremely slow. and not like classy Slow Food slow, but like, sitting there eating our fourth bowl of fish chips before our appetizers, and then sitting there with nothing to do for a good 20 min between appetizers and main dishes slow.The ugly:- the reso was 45 min late- the fried pig ears smelled like awful, awful feet. my friend actually covered them with his napkin until they took them away.The unremarkable:- compressed watermelon. not so compressed.- dessert.glad i tried it and it supports a good cause. probably wouldn go back.', I joined yelp to write this review, because I love commonwealth and hope they last a long time on the SF scene.They have managed to change an old burrito shop into a beautiful, warm space with amazing food. I agree with everyone else that you have to get the gnocchi and the garden tomatoes salad. Another fun thing was the sake cocktail that they freeze with liquid nitrogen and serve it almost like a sorbet, but alcoholic!The staff is really great too. They all said they were super excited to work for such a great cause. The hostess said that they were short that night and things were crazy but as a guest you couldn't tell at all. the open kitchen looked super chill and everyone was having a good time.Finally, they have kept true to their original mission of starting a charitable restaurant with kick-ass food. And, they even kept some of the old hilarious Chinese propaganda posters (in the bathroom) as a nice little reminder of where MSF all started next door in Lung Shan., 'I met up with a friend on a Saturday night for dinner here. We lucked out without reservations & still got a two-top. Tables are placed pretty close to each other, as I eavesdropped on the two Asian guys next to us for part of the time and also had to be careful getting in & out without knocking anything off the tables.We decided to get the tasting menu. FYI: Participation is required by the entire table for the tasting menu. He got the wine pairing, I did not (I needed to drive home & have gotten tipsy off of wine pairings before.) Also, $10 from each Chef tasting is donated to the San Francisco Food Bank. Coincidentally, my lunch event that day was a fundraiser for the San Francisco Food Bank too!We got a choice of still & sparkling water & were given a complementary bowl of homemade potato chips with side of vinegar foam/espuma, along with an amuse boche. This was followed by the tasting menu:Summer squash, chilled soup, fried blossoms, vadouvanCorn custard, sea urchin, chorizo, lobster emulsion, jalapenoSalt cured foie gras, umebashi, seaweed briocheHanger Steak, summer alliums, enoki mushrooms, wheatgrass jus Plum sorbet, almond graniteCinnamon mille-feuille, cardamom marshmallow, burnt honey ice creamThere was definitely some Asian (Japanese was what I thought of first, then also a hint of Indian) flavor with the dishes, with the tempura fried blossoms, uni on top of chawanmushi, umebashi, seaweed, enoki, vadouvan, cardamom,...you get the idea. Almost everything was fantastic! The only thing I didn care for & left on my plate (which I noticed that dining buddy had done the same) was the grilled onion, which was undercooked, that came with the hanger steak. The pacing of the dishes was good; I think they adjust it to the party...my friend and I like to take our time and chat, because it looked like the 2 guys next to us had gotten the tasting menu also, but they finished & left way before we did. Oh, & since my friend also go the wine pairing, that probably also slowed us down a bit too. Service was pleasant, friendly, yet unobstrusive. It looks like each week (I thought it was month, but their blog says week) they will donate to a different charity--nice! When we got the bill, there was also a questionnaire asking for suggestions for the charities for next month (as mentioned above, when we dined, it was San Francisco Food Bank). There are two unisex single room restrooms in the back. What with the Chinese poster art in the bathroom (at least in the one I used), though??They have a parking lot just north of the restaurant. I didn know & had parked on the street about 4 blocks away in between the restaurant & Rosamunde where I had met some other friends for drinks.Located on the west side of Mission, between 18th & 19th. The entrance is not on the storefront, but on the north side of the building, right off the parking lot.', 'This is the absolute sleeper of the new restaurants that have opened recently.Corn Custard- only a mad genius would think of combining urchin, jalapeno, lobster emulsion and chorizo. The flavors come together well with this dishGarden Tomatoes: tasted like they had just been picked from the garden. The black olive crumble and idiazabal cheese added a nice complexity to these perfect tomatoesSkate: cooked to perfectionGet your reservation now before the crowds find out about this spectacular restaurant. Please note that they have a parking lot next to the restaurant which is a HUGE plus.', It was very, very, very good food. And the chef (owner?) was very nice. And it certainly didn't seem like they had been open for only five days or so.I don't remember any particular dish, since we ate literally almost every single thing on the menu., This place just opened, but I think it might be my new favorite restaurant in SF. From the beginning of the meal to the end, everything was deliciously inventive, with a nice mix of fresh summery tastes and rich satisfying flavors. I particularly loved their tomato salad. I'm sure I've had hundreds of garden salads before, but this one really stood out: the flavors of the tomato really pop, and the cheese is a great balance. Lots of yelpers have mentioned the gnocchi, but I have to agree. It's like dream gnocchi, which transport you for a moment. The homemade marshmallow thing was so awesome--each part was delicious on its own, but together, it was kind of a religious experience for me. The dining room is full of natural light and blonde wood, so it feels very airy. I walked in without a reservation right when they opened at 5:30 and got a seat with no trouble but the place was pretty full by the time I left. Next time, I'm going to get their tasting menu. The couple next to us was oohing and aahing over the pairings with the tasting menu, and apparently the restaurant donates ten bucks from the tasting menus to charity. When I went it was the food bank, but they change it around. This place is awesome!, Commonwealth may be our new favorite restaurant in the Mission! Brought to you by Chef Jason Fox and many of his team from his previous restaurant, Bar Tartine. We dined there on their fourth day being open and everything was amazing! We did the Chef's Tasting Menu and had everything that Linda T. mentioned in her review of 8/22. All of the courses were delicious, but our absolute favorite was the corn custard with sea urchin, chorizo, jalapeno and lobster emulsion. Unbelievable! Our server was Jenna and she was wonderful. Everything flowed smoothly and the entire experience was delightful. Everything was so enjoyable that we went back a week later and ordered off the a la carte menu and everything was equally fresh and delicious. Commonwealth is a hit right out of the gate and Jason and his team are doing a fantastic job providing a memorable dining experience!, Its well known that San Francisco has a strong food culture and even throughout the recession this has not let up....in fact, recently the local food scene has actually gotten more and more interesting, with some notable and highly anticipated restaurant openings in the past weeks (and many more scheduled before the end of the year!)So what is it about the current climate that is fueling such culinary creativity? Is it some epic escapist urge that is making the masses look towards more and more innovative gastronomical chef-d'oeuvres? (rhetorical question)Yes. The public wants escape! They want mystery and magic and molecular gastronomy! They want froth.....And froth is certeintly on the menu at the very uncommon Commonwealth (brought to you by the creators of Mission Street Food).Now in a gorgeously retrofitted space on Mission and 18th on whose facade an original 1920's mural has been uncovered, the Mission Street Food collective has devised an elaborate menu of small plates and seasonal fare.So what is coming out of the kitchen? Liquid nitrogen aperitifs of Floc de Gascone, ambrosia lemon, sake and lime (making a rose colored slushy that is impeccably smooth for its lack of ice crystals), compressed watermelon salad (sweeter than your average watermelon salad because all the water from the watermelon has been compressed creating sugary saturated morels - of course!) and Fluke Crudo with rose gelle, jicama and douglas fir tips...among many other intriguing dishes.An open kitchen and a skylight give the space some expansiveness...shall we even say invoking a very New York air of refinement...(although the skylight looks in on views of the building's own wooden roof where a mirror'd disco ball has been strategially hung from the rafters!)Still, with the looming SF Food Wars, the competition between New York and San Francisco to see whose cuisine reigns supreme is getting hotter (tickets literally flew like hotcakes!) San Francisco is entering a new era of haute cuisine, pushing back, ploughing forward and generally speaking, experimenting., So Mission St. is quickly becoming the new Valencia. Businesses have learned that the rent is cheaper and rich hipsters like expensive grunge. I came hear instead of going to Mission Chinese Food, which was closed. Commonwealth is small, like many other Mission digs, but seats many people in a not-too-squished way. My hubbie and I opted to sit at the bar, which I totally recommend. We were able to watch the kitchen antics perfectly, and it felt like more of a show in artistic and scientific creation than a dining experience. The prices were low compared to what I'd expected for the ambiance, but we tend toward ordering fewer items than most people so that we can eat out more often. That said, we tried the gnocchi, which was amazing, and the compressed watermelon and tofu mousse-thing, which was not. Other dishes that we saw being prepared, such as the caprese salad-thing were crazy gorgeous, and worth ordering I bet. I tend not to order foods that I think I could make at home, but some of these dishes (even with simple ingredients) were so beautiful that it seemed worth the experience. I definitely recommend this place., 'I was on board with loving this place... but then I didn. I love the concept, chef, and aesthetic, but the food didn deliver.What we ordered:- padron peppers, goat cheese, rose- Complimentary Fish & Chips(Chips w/ Foam Vinegar Dipping Sauce)- compressed watermelon, tofu, nori, cucumber, wild greens, togarashi- potato gnocchi, corn, maitake mushrooms, sage, parm reg- guinea hen & prawnsPadron peppers and the gnocchi were both great. Everything else sounded better on the menu than it tasted. The guinea hen tasted flavorless and the other dishes seemed overcomplicated without any reason. If you want to choose between all of the latest new restaurants, go to Bar Agricole or Heirloom Cafe and you won be disappointed!', I'm falling in love with Commonwealth! Everything we ordered was delicious. Their wait staffs are super friendly and attentive. The result was one perfect date night.- We started with Compressed watermelon which was really refreshing. The Nori added a nice touch to the dish. And it looked really pretty too.- Fluke crudo went really well with Txakoli gel.- Potato gnocchi was probably the best dish of the night.- Sea Urchin with corn custard was really interesting, very creative.- Marrow stuffed Squid was nice but not stand out as much as other dishes.- Brown butter poached Skate Wing .. perfect execution.The wine list is relatively small but well thought out. We had a bottle of Sancerre Pinot Noir which went really well with the foods. We ended the night with green tea meringue and the white russian which were both really good. What a perfect meal!, 'wonderful meal. gnocci, compressed watermelon salad, marrow squid, prawn and hen, hanger steak accompanied by wine pairing. followed by white russian and burnt honey icecream/chocolate granache dessert. The food was impeccable and at a great value. This place will explode with popularity!', 'The aesthetic is gorgeous, very white and clean and glowy. The service is attentive. The food is . . . weird. I will totally admit that I new to the foam as food thing, but I tried everything with an open mind and high expectations. I still don get it. Most of it just tasted either bland or too salty to me. Wanted to love this place but felt like a very expensive science experiment.', Jason Fox has really done it this time! I met him in NYC while dining at WD50 which is pretty out there when it comes to weird interesting food (he was dining there as well) and now he has created a fantastic menu with very reasonable prices! Even with wild things like Douglas Fir Needles and pink rose petals, the food is still of substance, genuine and beautifully crafted. The place can get a bit too loud and the delectable food should be spotted with better lighting but with a parking lot adjacent and attentive and detailed service (server went around the table to pour over my right shoulder!)...this place is a big winner! Please don't dumb it down and keep coming up with more new wonderful creations!, Terrific new restaurant.Decor - simple and elegant. A nice surprise is if you look up, you can see a cut out of the attic with a disco ball hanging from the rafters.Service - very good. Our server was quick. One complaint might be that the food arrived before our wine and the was served in pairs so one dish got cold while we ate the other dish.Good - Terrific. Very innovative flavors.Gnocchi - This was the standout dish. The gnocchi was fresh and tasted unlike any other. It came with mushrooms and grilled corn. Watermelon salad - The watermelon is paired with very peppery greens. The juxtaposition of flavors is terrific. I also loved the candied nori. Sea urchin - The sea urchin with corn custard, chorizo and jalapenos was so original. The flavors worked very well together and I loved the texture. My only complaint is that I could not find the chorizo.Lamb tongue - This was the weakest dish. The tongue itself was boring. It worked very nicely with the barley and mint. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't impressive.Cardamon marshmallow dessert - This is the best deconstructed smore you will ever taste. I was not crazy about the individual components - but when eaten together, the cardamon marshmallow gave a memorable and complex flavor and worked beautifully with the chocolate ganache and the honey ice cream.Overall this restaurant is worth going to and the prices are reasonable considering the quality and caliber of meal., Fabulous dining company. Progressive interpretation of ingredients. Philanthropic business model. On a quiet Thursday night, the fabulous Connie C. and I were catching up and enjoyed a progressive dinner at the philanthropic Commonwealth. The dd9cor is clean and minimialistic - white washed walls, light oak wooden tables and Edison bulbs hung overhead. We started off with the complimentary Housemade Chips with Nori and Malt Vinegar Mousse. A play on fish and chips, they were one addicting little salty snack. We finished the entire bowl despite all the dishes we also had at the table.We shared a number of the exciting, innovative offerings on the menu and dessert menu:Garden Tomatoes and Basil, Black Olive Crumble, Smoked Bread and Idiazabal Cheese. Potato Gnocchi, Corn, Maitake Mushrooms, Sage, Parmesan Reggiano and Truffle OilCorn Custard, Sea Urchin, Chorizo, Lobster Emulsion and JalapenoButter Poached Black Cod, Cauliflower, Dashi and Sea BeansYoung Hen and Spot Prawn, Spinach, Artichoke and Chocolate-Almond EmulsionWhite Russian: Coffee Ice Cream, Vodka Geld9e, Raw Milk Mousse, and Gd9noise Cake Cinnamon Mille-Feuille, Cardamom Marshmallow, Chocolate Ganache, and Burnt Honey Ice CreamThe tomatoes were light and sweet and I especially like the Idiazabal cheese, a soft sheep milk cheese with mild flavors. The potato gnocchi was my favorite of the night. Light and pillowy, they melted like butter in my mouth. The fresh corn added a nice textural contrast to the dish. The steamed corn custard was silky, so silky I thought it could have been tofu or steamed egg. I couldn't quite make the connection between the raw sea urchin and the steamed egg custard. It seemed a bit random to me. We then moved onto the butter poached cod topped with a piece of crispy skin. It was cooked perfectly though I wish there was still a little more contrast in texture. The hen was tender and moist while the prawn is cooked again to perfection, not a second more. They sprinkled grains of salt over the dish, which made the dish a little oversalted, and we both actually bit into grains of salt.We both loved, loved, loved the Cinnamon Mille-Feuille, Cardamom Marshmallow, Chocolate Ganache, and Burnt Honey Ice Cream. It was a deconstructed and reinterpreted s'more. The bitter chocolate ganache was thick and creamy. The marshmallow had the fluffiest texture and hints of cardamom (ginger) flavors. Connie convinced the table next to us and the table next to them to both order this dessert.The White Russian was a coffee ice cream with vodka geld9e and raw milk mousse atop a gd9noise cake. The coffee ice cream is very good and they were smal bits of toffee and coffee beans sprinkled over the dessert.All that helps Commonwealth to donate parts of its proceeds to a monthly unique charity. Psst, check out the art work in the unisex restrooms. Connie and I sure did.Eat well and do well!, I can see why a lot of people like this place. It's a gem in the mission. Own parking lot, foodie menu, very reasonable prices, creative cuisine. I'm withholding the 5 star because not every dish is a hit. And, for the first time, I actually tried every dish on the menu.here's how that went -- 3 of us were going to do the tasting menu $60, and then realized that for the same price we could try every dish on the menu (had duplicates of the soup and custard since harder to split) by sharing. brilliant! i think our waitress even cracked a smile after our order*nori chips with malt vinegar mousse -- excellent, just the right amount of nori, and such airy mousse*shishito peppers, goat cheese, and rose -- ok, not a fan of edible flowers*crispy smelt, tomatillo relish, rau ram -- kinda look like fries at first, dish is ok*summer squash, chilled soup fried blossoms, shaved salad, vadouvan -- a homerun, very tasty dish. i think of ubuntu's vadouvan cauliflower pot, and you know this spice certainly can deliver*garden tomatoes and basil, black olive crumble, smoked bread, idiazabal cheese -- very safe dish with great ingredients, fresh, good cheese too, recommended*compressed watermelon, tofu, nori, cucumber, wild greens, togarashi -- quite interesting, and compressed watermelon do deliver as advertised, but didn't find the tofu, minimal nori, not quite as good as other dishes*potato gnocchi, corn, maitake mushrooms, sage, parmesan reggiano, truffle oil -- definitely taste the truffle oil here, mmm good, gnocchi texture not quite as smooth as some, but still soft and tasty dish with the corn and mushrooms*fluke crudo, peach, rose gelee, jicama, douglas fir tips -- one of those dishes that looks really pretty, tasted ok*corn custard, sea urchin, chorizo, lobster emulsion, jalapeno -- great combination of ingredients, like how the flavor morphs once you get some chorizo and jalapeno, excellent dishafter these dishes, I later felt like the meal had already hit the high notes*marrow stuffed squid, tamarind pork, shelling beans, black garlic, cilantro -- now here the squid was stuffed wtih the pork, and wasn't as tasty as it sounded*butter poached black cod, cauliflower, dashi, sea beans -- fish prepared well, with cauliflower foam but nothing amazing*grilled lamb tongue, chard, burnt eggplant, miso, mint -- avoid this dish like the plague unless you want gamey lamb. doesn't look appetizing, flavor not dressed up at all. only positive was that it was soft*young hen and spot prawn, spinach, artichoke, chocolate-almond emulsion -- young hen was tasty, also a ham like element, not as commanding a dish as it could have been, too salty on the spot prawn*hanger steak, summer alliums, enoki mushrooms, crushed fingerlings, wheatgrass -- disappoint. hanger steak too chewy despite its appearance*dessert = cinnamon mille feuille, cardamom marshmallow, chocolate ganache, burnt honey ice cream...kinda impressive without a pasty chef, like a deconstructed smores, worked pretty well in a small amountso i think the tasting menu is actually the way to go -- they have selected their greatest hits for it -- thus you'll come away very positivebe sure to eat: soup, gnocchi, custardAfter coming back for the $75 tasting menu a few years later, I can really see the refinement and progression in the dishes. certainly a top place at the price point. lots of use of indian spices. not too much foam.*salmon confit, almond gazpacho, charred cucumber relish, frozen grapes -- ok, complicated, too many things going on*scallops, sea hearts of palm, popcorn puree, yuku kosho milk -- perfect dish, excellent blending of flavors*green strawberries, bee and fennel pollens, goat cheese, mizuna, black radish -- a bit too much green*waygu beef, snap peas, broccoli rabe, spring onions, horseradish -- excellent flavor, perfectly cooked, interesting, beautiful presentation*celery sorbet, verjus soda -- unique and worked amazingly well*peanut butter semifreddo, chocolate ganache, frozen popcorn -- tasty, Love the concept, the food, the space, the prices - yes, I think Commonwealth may be my new favorite restaurant in the Mission.Although the $60 tasting menu looked divine, we opted to go a la carte because there were a few dishes we wanted to try off the tasting menu. Unfortunately, the foie gras was not an option on the a la carte menu. We enjoyed everything we had. The complimentary housemade chips with nori and malt vinegar mousse were highly addictive. I could definitely snack on a bag full of these chips every day. My girlfriend and I decided to share five dishes and two desserts, based on our friendly server's recommendations. Portions are small, so it's suggested that each person orders 2-3 dishes.** Garden Tomatoes and Basil, Black Olive Crumble, Smoked Bread and Idiazabal Cheese - SO fresh. The delicate spherical cheese and the crunchy olives were perfect compliments to the heirloom tomatoes.** Potato Gnocchi, Corn, Maitake Mushrooms, Sage, Parmesan Reggiano and Truffle Oil - Perfectly cooked gnocchi. Anything with truffle oil is automatically amazing.* Corn Custard, Sea Urchin, Chorizo, Lobster Emulsion and Jalapeno - Unique texture of the corn custard, very much like silky tofu.* Butter Poached Black Cod, Cauliflower, Dashi and Sea Beans - Soft and flaky black cod with a delicious crispy skin.* Young Hen and Spot Prawn, Spinach, Artichoke and Chocolate-Almond Emulsion - Very tender hen and tasty prawn with a yummy sauce.** White Russian: Coffee Ice Cream, Vodka Geld9e, Raw Milk Mousse, and Gd9noise Cake - Fantastic, and a must if you're a fan of coffee.** Cinnamon Mille-Feuille, Cardamom Marshmallow, Chocolate Ganache, and Burnt Honey Ice Cream - This was AMAZING! Like a decadent deconstructed s'more.Our meal with glasses of wine came out to $65/person including tip, which was really reasonable. Additional pluses: They have their very own free parking lot, which is especially nice if you're a female because it can get a little sketchy at night. And as they are affiliated with Mission Street Food, they donate part of the price of each tasting menu to charitable causes, which will change on a weekly basis. Gotta love good food for a good cause. ** Must order!, 'Food - 4 Stars +, Portion size - 1 star. I had great expectation before coming to this place. The three of us ladies ordered 2 appetizers and 4 entrd9es to share thinking that there would be a reasonable amount of food. Our waitress had even reassured us that there would be far more than enough. However, by the time our entrd9es appeared, we knew the portion sizes would just be enough for one of us. If we knew that we would be getting these tasting portions as entrees, we would have ordered accordingly. Each dish had at most 2 bites for each of us. Size matters when the half bite is barely enough to carry the burst of flavors. To be fair, the taste of every dish was extraordinary and had live up to my expectation flavor-wise. Their gnocchi and marrow stuffed squid dishes were probably unmatched by others in the city. The only dish that needed more work was the fluke crudo with diced fruit bits; it only barely passed the flavor test with very very mild flavors. All in all, I would come back for the food. But they ought to be pricing accordingly and provide bread as well to make me a satisfied patron when the total bill came out to be $15/bite .', 'amazing!', It is a feature of Yelp that pretty much any shiny newly opened restaurant in a trendy location can earn a 4+ star rating. All the cool and easily impressed Yelp elite kids flock there and dole out their adorative reviews to community adoration of their own. It's a vicious cycle, with everyone coming out a winner. But Leon, you're not that cool! You disdain the masses. You give 2 star reviews just out spite! But this is a 4 Star review! HAVE YOU SOLD OUT? No, guys, I have *not* sold out. But commonwealth is actually kind of good. It hurts to admit it... but it's true. Walking in on a Wed evening with no reservations, but in the company of the lovely M, we were seated at the bar almost immediately. The place has that slick Euromodernist look that these kinds of places do adore. Really, it has the feeling of a slightly less trashy version of the place shown in Soul Kitchen. I think that's what they were going for. I constantly kept expecting a knife wielding chef to come after me for my mistreatment of his soup. With this in mind, I did not order soup. Instead, for the main course, we got the Flank Steak and the Compressed Watermelon with tofu. Now, I know Tofu, and what came with the watermelon was no tofu. It looked and acted like globs of slightly congealed soy milk and I did not have it. The rest of the dish, fortunately, was quite delicious. The watermelon and other sort of melon was very juicy and salty and flavorful and the grass it was surrounded by provided a nice contrast. The Flank Steak came next. Now, cows are pretty large animals, right? They've got massive flank. The dish, on the other hand, had the opposite of massive flank, which is to say... four tiny pieces of medium rare steak surrounded by incredibly tasty onions and a perfectly cooked potato with the tastiest crispy skin ever... if only there was more meat. For desert, we split the Cinnamon Mille-Feuille, which was a Deconstructed marshmallow worthy of Derrida himself. Yum. So, considering the small portions, elaborately structured dishes, and decor, you'd expect this place would cost us at least 30 a person. WRONG. All this cost us merely $40... 3 Stars for Food +1 Star for being not ridiculously priced., Food -- sea urchin corn custard and gnocchi are so tasty and memorable. Skip the crispy pork ear as it's dried and tasteless. I had high hope for the stuffed squid but the sausage stuffing turned out to be blend/mushy which killed the nice squid flavor. Am indifferent with the other dishes -- solid but didn't wow me.Service -- Attentive at first but become sloppier when the restaurant started to fill upDecor -- simple, modern, and comfortable, 'I really like Commonwealth. It has the feel of Commis in Oakland, but the food is more accessible. Given that the place has been open just a few weeks, the service is remarkable: sweet, enthusiastic, and attentive. The food was at best incredible and at worst very good. Garden tomatoes and basil with black olive crumble, smoked bread, idiazabel cheese was great. Perfectly fresh and tasty tomatoes were well complemented by the cheese and novel olive crumble, which added texture. Also great was gnocchi with corn, mushrooms, sage, parmesan, and truffled oil. The gnocchi were light, the corn sweet, and the truffled oil lent a nice accent. In fact, I could easily eat vegetarian here as these plates were the highlights of my meal. Marrow stuffed squid with tamarind pork, shelling beans, black garlic, and cilantro was very nice although the pork added less to the plate than you might think.Hanger steak with summer allums, enoki mushrooms, a crushed fingerling potato and wheat grass was nice but a bit over-salted. Also, the crushed potato was a bit dense. Yet the steak was tasty and as I said above the least of the dishes here are very good. Overall the food is stylish, well presented, and has a bit of edge to it. My server was sweet and enthusiastic (and with good reason). And the size of each dish is somewhat between small plates and an entree allowing you to sample. Get here before it becomes too popular and the lines get too long.', 'a place for foodie scenesters. be honest to yourself, the food is just okay.in the end, i was left missing el herradero.', For those who followed Jason Fox at Bar Tartine, Commonwealth is Chef Fox's new spot. Interestingly, so many of the staff from Bar Tartine moved with Chef Fox some diners might assume that Commonwealth is just Bar Tartine at a new location. They would be wrong. Chef Fox offers upscale food.Innovative flourishes have sneaked onto the menu. Hints of molecular gastronomy and plays on temperature peek out. The malt vinegar espuma with the potato chips creates a striking contrast between a soft foamy texture and the sour twang of the malt vinegar. We also had an aperitif using nitrogen to create a smooth, ice-cream-like texture. And the chilled summer squash soup pairs nicely with a hot, freshly fried blossom.All of the food is solid, well executed. One of the dishes that made the transition from Bar Tartine to Commonwealth includes the corn custard with sea urchin. So delicious! The wine pairing was also enjoyable and fairly reasonable considering the upscale nature of the food presentation. While the food may be quite different from Bar Tartine, the service remains impeccable. Professional, formal dining service but with an ease and familiarity that puts diners at in just the mood so quickly that they may not notice how great the service is. I recommend this place highly., This restaurant is so close to being awesome! But, they're kind of holding themselves back - hopefully they can make a few minor adjustments.First, they have a parking lot - in the Mission of all places. Yay! It's got a neat side entrance that allows for more seats. Conversely, this also makes it wickedly cold when the door opens and a blast of SF fog rolls into the quaint dining room. The host is a gem and very attentive. She checked us in and then took a drink order because our table wasn't quite ready. Nice touch.Food was a little to heavy on the foams (trying to pass them off as mousse) on almost every plate. The complimentary potato chips were poorly executed and should be skipped. The malt foam (mousse) served on the side didn't help. Mostly everything else tasted great with complex ingredients, textures and flavors. Things to not miss: gnocchi, pressed watermelon, tomato salad, some deconstructed s'more. The portions were a little small for the prices. Perhaps the portions would be larger if they chose laser printing for their menus and business cards opposed to costly letterpress. Did I mention the parking lot?, 'Awww. I so reluctant to write a bad review of Commonwealth. I really really really want to like this place. Everyone is lovely, the restaurant looks terrific and all my foodie friends think it divine. Poppy apparently possesses a plebeian palate because she thought just about every dish was pretentiously sub par. Housemade chips with a dip made out of malt vinegar and gelatin, sounded intriguing and tasted a little weird...and I generally like weird flavored chips like worchester and roast chicken...The compressed watermelon salad excited me upon first viewing, there were these white semi spheres which I thought were fresh mozarella...my dinner partner was excited because he thought they were eggs...we were both wrong...it was foam made out of tofu and something else..perhaps soy milk? There was also something very crunchy hiding under the salad which freaked me out, thinking I was eating ground glass but turned out to be a salty sugar glass with seaweed bits in it.Gnocchi was ridiculously tasty, a perfect combo of truffle oil, mushrooms and cheese. easily the best thing I ate all night.Corn custard was generally flavorless except for the plethora of red jalepeno slices. A generous piece of sea urchin tasted like it had been marinating in a whale large intestine for weeks and the lobster emulsion (what with all the foam this place serves) was extremely salty. I really and truly always eat everything. I had a horrible dinner at Fifth Floor bar and kept eating hoping it would get better. This is one item that I seriously considered not finishing. Hangar steak was fine, nothing special other than being remarkably small, although for 15 dollars I think it not worth complaining too much about.Dessert was relatively tasty BUT Poppy still feels the need to lodge a complaint here. It was sold as a mille feuille. Literally that is thousand leaf and generally in dessert terms its layers of something... This was a square of something marshmallowy, a cinnamon sprinkled square of filo, a generous square of chocolatey ganache and another square of filo. None of these squares were even close to being stacked on each other and although very tasty (especially the ice cream on the side) it just not cool with me when you misname something on a menu. I felt cheated because I got something (no matter how tasty) that wasn what I expected. I might give them another try in a year or so but I have to carefully peruse the menu and I certainly wouldn want to be paying the tab.', 'Commonwealth bills itself as A progressive American restaurant in San Francisco Mission district. And progressive it is, especially if you get the $60 tasting menu since they give $10 to charity. They also mean the food is progressive; so though the dishes are thoroughly modern, many evoke familiar feelings.Housemade potato chips come lightly showered in konbu powder accompanied by a ramekin of malt vinegar foam. Salt and vinegar chips seem to make more sense when the vinegar isn a powder. Seaweed chips? Why didn I think of that? I knew that deep-fried or toasted nori is delicious.Compressed watermelon chunks looked like dice of heirloom tomatoes under fresh greens and mint leaves. Very refreshing if a little harsh, and the spots of tofu foam around the perimeter contributed little to the dish.Crispy Pig Ears. Theye pig ears and theye fried til crisp like chicharrones and served on some pickled daikon and carrot stolen from a banh mi. Look for these on a bar menu near you soon.The corn custard with sea urchin, chorizo, lobster emulsion and jalaped1o was a nod to the Japanese steamed egg custard dish chawan-mushi. The silky custard had a light sweetness of corn and concealed tiny but intense crumbles of chorizo. What better on which to place a lobe of briny sea urchin? A lobster broth would make the dish damp, so the foam added the right amount of flavor without water-logging the custard. Thin slices of pickled red jalaped1o offset the rich and sweet flavors. All in all, a masterful and balanced dish executed perfectly.Squid stuffed with marrow and tamarind pork was another great dish. I am not sure what the inspiration for this dish is, but it was executed flawlessly. Tender squid, even the tentacles, is stuffed with a soft but meaty filling of marrow and perhaps finely minced pork. This spends a short time picking up a little sear on a robata grill and then sits atop a small bed of beans and a pair of sauces - one brown redolent of Indian tamarind chutney, and one as brightly flavored of cilantro as it is brightly green in color.The butter-poached black cod and the lamb tongue reveal the kitchen predilection for burnt flavors. The proteins themselves were once again perfectly cooked but the accompaniments did lean toward a sort of over-toasted taste profile.Desserts include a deconstructed (and reconstructed) White Russian which suffered from an overabundance of crunchy whole coffee beans and something advertised as a cinnamon mille feuille. The beans provided too much of a textural contrast with the smooth ice cream. Perhaps they would have worked better if they were cracked. The mille feuille was not really a mille feuille - instead it was a small rectangle of cardamom cake next to some marshmallow-like thing, dark chocolate mousse and a scoop of intensely flavored honey ice cream (delicious!). Looks to me like a deconstructed smore fashioned of excellent ingredients.All in all, the food was very good to excellent. The white walled room is spare and would feel kind of sterile if not for the convivial crowd and smiling but professional staff. The restrooms are not quite as nice as the rest of the place, and some might find it odd to have the Nine Yuan Shuai* watch you take a leak.I not going to rush back, but I don think that the point of a restaurant like this. I am eager to see what they will do in a few months when the seasonal ingredients change.* Yuan Shuai was a rank within China People Liberation Army equivalent to Marshal. There were originally 10 of them, but Lin Biao was temporarily removed from the record in starting 1971 after a failed attempt at a coup. Lin and his family died in a mysterious plane crash in Mongolia on September 13, 1971 while purportedly fleeing to the USSR.', 'Foam is so 2 years ago. Commonwealth likes to put foam on many things. I was excited to try this place, but I was totally underwhelmed by most of the offerings. Fried smelt - so so. Cod, kind of flavorless, and with foam. Watermelon -- an intriguing blend of flavors -- including foam. Hen with prawns - a weird combo and no flavors that had me keening. Even the dessert -- White Russian -- had foam, and a bizarre gelatinous consistency to boot.The gnocchi was to die for. I would eat that again and again. But otherwise, nothing made me hanker for more.', If you are looking for a fancy, small meal, this is the place for you! The food was all quite good, standard upscale American fare. Don't let the $12 plates lull you into a sense of security about the money in your wallet, though. If you want a full meal, you're going to want an appetizer, 2 plates of food, and a dessert. Not wanting to break the bank, we just got appetizers to split and one main course each. Needless to say, I should have gone for the bacon-wrapped hot dog from the street stand we passed on the walk there. However, a trip to El Farolito afterward cured my empty stomach., Small but cozy space in the Mission with its own parking lot... opened by the chef from Bar Tartine, Jason Fox and Mission Street Food founder, Anthony Myint.They start you off with their tasty house made potato chips, spiced with konbu.The Fluke Crudo was very subtle and delicate, my friend thought the peach was too sour.The Compressed Watermelon Salad was awesome, great technique in this dish, compressing the juice out of the watermelon then re-infusing it with its own liquid. The combination of bitter greens, mint, and basil was really refreshing.The Uni Corn Custard was executed nicely but personally I didn't like the corn flavor in the custard.The Marrow & Pork Stuffed Squid was excellent, melding all the flavors and textures. I especially liked this with the black garlic puree.Hen & Prawn had a nicely cooked spot prawn, and good chicken roulade with a mole inspired sauce. The edges of the roulade weren't quite as crispy as they could be.Lamb Tongue featured a very tender quick grilled lamb tongue that went well with the chard and barley.Service was excellent and informative. We had a couple bottles of white wine that were pretty interesting, complex notes I wasn't used to with whites., 'Decor is amazing; I love the disco ball lighting through the skylight and the alternating light bulbs and plant bulbs. The squash soup is delicious and the sea urchin was out of this world - creamy and sweet because of the corn custard, yet briny and spicy due to the sea urchin and jalaped1o. The goat was perfectly cooked and the yogurt put it over the top, although the chickpeas were a little salty for my taste. The cinnamon mille feuille was to die for. Burnt honey ice cream, cardamom marshmallow, spiced wafers, and chocolate ganache? Heaven.', 'Came here really hyped and excited, but Commonwealth just didn click with me. Hit and miss sums it up for me. Compressed Watermelon Salad was anything but the epicurean revelation it was hyped up to be. Same with the Corn Custard with Sea Urchin---while it (almost like korean steamed egg), the sea urchin was way too fishy and overpowered the dish. The hen and prawn was definitely a hit-and-miss; the sweet prawn was perfect, and my girlfriend and I were not looking a bit attractive sucking those heads for all the delicious insides. But the hen was not to either of our likings. But hold on, the potato gnocchi with maitake mushrooms and truffle oil...where did this come from? How can you make gnocchi that perfect? Still blows me away. The tomatoes and basil, a beautiful deconstruction of caprese salad, was exquisite (am I pretentious enough to use that word?). The cheese was perfect, and reminded me of a really light goat cheese. Wonderful.Of course, points for the service. Our waitress was eager about giving us recommendations and really helped explain everything, and no small detail was off a beat. I was really fighting to give Commonwealth four stars, because I think it is a good restaurant. But there were too many misses, and while I can give it points for innovation and atmosphere, it fell short in the most important category: execution. I asked the girlfriend for her take: It was good, but I don think I will come back.But I won give up on you, yet, Commonwealth!', 'Foam, foam, foamalicious.Foam vinegar with the chips, foam on the fish, foam on the sea urchin. Foamy whipped cream on the dessert (is that possible?!) Totally different textures than any restaurant I have been to lately. The flavors here were amazing. All the dishes were gorgeously presented, everything was fresh and lovely. Everyone at my table loved the gnocci the most. It was awesome. Service was perfect. A great dining experience, but not the type of restaurant you would crave and want to go back to regularly.', A new restaurant by former chef of Bar Tartine? I'm there! RESERVATIONS:My friend made reservations for the two of us via opentable.com for Sunday, September 5 at 5:30pm. Make sure you make reservations because walk-ins sit at the bar. If you want a particular time, book as early as you can. We booked almost a week beforehand and there was only early or late times available.MENU TIPS:*Dish sizes are small to medium*They recommend 2-3 dishes per person*Menu is divided by protein FOOD:*Complimentary still or sparkling water*Complimentary housemade potato chips with a vinegar sauce*$60 for tasting menu - the entire table has to participate though*Crispy Pig Ears, Carrot, Radish, Chili ($6) - Not bad. I'll admit that I was a bit sketchy when my friend ordered pig ears, but it was deep fried and tasted like pork rinds.*Compressed Watermelon, Tofu, Nori, cucumber, Wild greens, Togarashi ($11) - The salad was okay. Red and yellow pieces of watermelon are used as the base and wild greens and slices of cucumber placed on top. Sprinkled on top is a hard sugar like nori component. I'm not sure where the tofu was in this dish, but an odd, almost tangy white sauce/foam is placed around the dish.*Marrow stuffed squid, Tamarind Pork, Shelling Beans, Black Garlic, Cilantro ($13) - This was the dish I was looking forward to and although it was good, I felt that it didn't meet my expectations. Two pieces of squid was stuffed with a tamarind pork and bone marrow mix and placed on top of shelling beans. The marrow was not noticeable to me and I found the tamarind pork overwhelmed the entire dish, as that all you really tasted.*Young Hen and Spot Prawn, Spinach, Artichoke, Chocolate Almond Emulsion ($16) - YUM, the hen was AMAZING!!! I've never had hen this tender!! The spot prawns were a pass though, they were a bit on the soft and mushy side. The spinach and artichoke was a nice compliment on the dish, but I wasn't a fan of the chocolate emulsion sauce. *Cinnamon mille-feuille, Cardamom Marshmellow, Chocolate Ganache, Burnt Honey Ice Cream ($8) - YUM, a must order! The lady at the table next to us called it a deconstructed s'more which I guess that's basically what it was with a side of honey ice cream. The honey ice cream and the cinnamon mille-feuille were amazing and the two items of the dish that was a must try. The chocolate ganache was good, but the marshmellow sprinkled with cardamom was the least enjoying part of the dish, as I'm not a fan of many spices.SERVICE:Good, our waitress was nice, helpful and explained the menu very well. Our plates were taken away as soon as we were done to make room for the next dish.PARKING:A small, 9 car lot is located adjacent to Commonwealth meant for their customers only, however there are signs that there is a $5 fee to use their lot. Since Commonwealth is located in the Mission, parking is a bit difficult and you're just paying for convenience., 'FOAM PARTY ANYONE?Commonwealth seems to take foaming to a whole different level, they put foam on almost everything! They must make it by the tons, enough to throw a foam party after-hours. And, if I didn know any better, I would have thought that Top Chef villainous Marcel Vigneron was Chef/Owner of Commonwealth. All you Top Chef Fans should know what I talking about...On Sunday, 9.5.10, my friend and I were promptly seated for our 5:30 PM reservations.FOOD:Commonwealth offers a $60 Chef Tasting Menu; $10 is donated to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network (full participation needed by entire party). We opted to order from the a la carte menu (2-3 dishes are recommended per person).*Complimentary Housemade Chips w/ Vinegar Foam: GOOD! The chips were light and very crisp (think Kettle Chips). It was lightly dusted w/ nori which added a salty and slightly smokey flavor. The accompanying foam vinegar was tangy, sweet, and sour which helped balanced some of the oiliness from the chips. *Crispy Pig Ears ($6): YUM! The freshly fried CPE were warm, salty, savory, and very crunchy. I thought it would have had a chewy texture from the cartilage, but most of the pieces didn. If you like chicharrones, you will enjoy the CPE. It was a bit rich for me, so I used the vinegar foam from the chips to balance out the flavors.*Compressed Watermelon Salad ($11): GOOD! This is the perfect summer salad; the tri-color watermelons were sweet and juicy, the wild greens were crisp and peppery, and the nori candy crisp added a sweet crunch and nutty flavor. However, I wasn very fond of all the arugula used b/c it had a strong peppery flavor which overpowered the watermelons. There was also an accompanying foam which was very bland and tasted like beaten egg whites.*Corn Custard w/ Sea Urchin ($15): Just OK! Although the dish is a good concept, it wasn executed properly. The highlight of the dish was definitely the fresh sea urchin which was thick and rich w/ a slight brininess. However, I expected the custard to be velvety and smooth; instead it had the texture of a semi-firm tofu. There were way too many corn kernels that were clumped together and the chorizo was burnt to a crisp and didn add much flavor to it. The lobster emulsion was a bland and again tasteless foam was added.*Marrow Stuffed Squid ($13): GOOD! The squid was perfectly grilled and tender. The black garlic and cilantro added a nice salty garlicky kick w/ a pop of freshness. However, the term marrow stuffed is a bit misleading b/c the squid was filled w/ a pork sausage mixture w/ very little marrow in it. Although, the pork was well-seasoned, the saltiness subdued any remnants of bone marrow.*Butter Poached Black Cod ($14): YUMMY! I rarely order cooked fish at restaurants b/c most places tend to overcook it. However, based on all the good reviews, I knew I had to try the black cod. The flesh of the cod was very soft and delicate and flaked off w/ the gently swipe of my fork. The skin was light and crisp which added a nice texture contrast. The lemon confit complemented the cod by adding a nice citrus punch. But, I wasn a fan of the cauliflower b/c although it was crispy, it was burnt to a black char. Yet again, bland foam topped the cod.*Cinnamon Mille Feuille, Cardamom Marshmallow, Chocolate Ganache and Burnt Honey Ice Cream ($8): DELISH! A nice take on a deconstructed smores! The Cinnamon Mille Feuille was like a crisp, buttery and flakey piece of phyllo dough, the marshmallow was warm, soft, and ooey goeey w/ a touch of earthy spice from the cardamom, the ganache like the center of a rich decadent truffle, and the burnt honey ice cream was rich, creamy, and sweet (similar to a light caramel). Together, it was perfect combo of various flavors, textures, and temperatures.SERIVICE:Very friendly and down-to-earth. Our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu, took our orders promptly, and checked on us several times to make sure everything was ok. AMBIANCE/DdaCOR:Displaying a funky mural of Hunt Quality Donuts, you wouldn think Commonwealth would be a contemporary establishment. For those who have been to Bar Tartine, the ambiance and dd9cor of Commonwealth is very reminiscent of its clean and sleekness; light oak tables, white brick walls, honeycomb paintings, and bar seating.There table seating for about 35 which is cramped and seating at the bar for 10 which is even tighter. PARKING:Commonwealth has their own private lot which has 8 spaces, however, it $5 for parking. I personally rather pay the $5 then have to circle around and around looking for street parking.Overall, I can see eye-to-eye with the 5 Star reviews. Many of the dishes are a great concept in theory, but don meet the mark in terms of the flavors and textures combos (esp the FOAM), so 3 Stars for the food. An extra Star goes to Commonwealth charitable efforts!', so far, my favorite restaurant in sf... LOVE LOVE LOVE! I didn't think culinary creativity could taste so good..., I really wanted to like Commonwealth. The space is sleek and they have an interesting menu that takes some risks. Goat roasted in hay? Lamb tongue? I commend them for veering from the same old. I also admire the charitable efforts. However, this was truly one of the worst meals I have had in San Francisco in years.**Service: Friendly but incredibly slow. We waited an eternity for wine, ordering, our food. She literally forgot our wine order and came back to ask us what we wanted again.**Food: The food was average at best. The stuffed peppers were decent, the gnocchi was pleasant and the rest was not great but not terrible. There was no flavor profile that was memorable or would make me want to necessarily come back but up until the entrees, I wasn't terribly unhappy. Then we got the entrees: black cod with some kind of chocolate/almond foam and Young Hen with Spotted Prawns. The cod was literally inedible. It was the most vile tasting thing ever. It was simultaneously bitter and sour and the texture was very glutenous. I was actually shocked a restaurant would put out something that tasted like that. I can't speak to the hen because I literally didn't want to put one more bite in my mouth after that but my tablemates did not enjoy the hen either.They were very kind and took the cod off the bill but any restaurant that could let something that tastes like that out the door has some serious work to do.I hope they improve their game and it is very early, so hopefully they will., 'Had a impromptu dinner last night - 1st time there. Yes, service is flawless and every course we had was delightful! From the crispy pig ears, to the desserts (loved the white russian, even w/out the vodka gelee addition). Hen and prawn - sweet/savory hen, but the prawn was a bit mealy. Fluke crudo - delicate and just divine. Gnocchi was a big hit - so light and fluffy - truffles were the perfect addition. And I could eat every day the stuffed squid with marrow!! The only problem we ALL had was that when we left, our clothes were permeated with the scent of food - no ventilation what so ever in the restaurant!! Sad, but true.....though will not us from returning (jeans it will be)', I WANT THE PB & J. Life isn't the same without it. PLEASE?!?!?!, Ever since first going to Mission Street Food and hearing about what they were doing I have been a fan so finally getting out to Commonwealth was filled with expectations. Luckily things started off well with the kombu dusted potato chips which were an amazing starter!I was dining with Chad S. who got the Narwhal - a funky drunk that's part slushie but includes Floc de Gascogne, sake, ambrosia melon and lime. It had quite a little kick and was a really unique flavor that was quite tasty!Since Mister Bill suggested the Crispy Pig Ears we got those too which were like pork rinds but upscale.I tasted some of Chad's Summer Squash Soup which was chilled and full of flavor and totally refreshing. I had the Garden Tomatoes and Basil which was delish. The tomatoes were bursting with flavor and the idiazabal cheese globules were awesome - I hadn't had that type of cheese before and love it.For my main I had the Young Hen & Spot Prawn which was pretty good. I have to say I like the hen much more than the prawns. It did remind me of eating crawdads Cajun style in the South and I even sucked the head and inauspiciously as possible since the space is a bit more fancy than most crawfish boils I'd been to in Alabama and Louisiana.For dessert I had the White Russian which had coffee ice cream, vodka gelee, raw milk mousse and genoise cake. It was pretty awesome even though of course it's not quite like the drink, but I didn't expect it to.I'd love to come back and try the tasting menu some time, since many of the items on that piqued my interest. Yum yum!, how can i forget to write a review for commonwealth? probably cuz i've been eating out so much that i forget to review them. i came here on my birthday and i am glad i did. i don't really eat in the mission because it's hard to find parking - so when i arrived and found out there is a parking lot for $5, i gladly agree to pay the $5. the menu was nice and simple. just order everything! jk... we almost did because the plates are pretty small. each person probably orders 3-4 dishes per person. here's what we ordered: - compressed watermelon, tofu, nori, cucumber, wild greens, togarashi- potato gnocchi, corn, maitake mushrooms, sage, parmesan reggiano, truffle oil- corn custard, sea urchin, chorizo, lobster emulsion, jalapeno- marrow stuffed squid, tamarid pork, shelling beans, black garlic, cilantro- butter poached black cod, cauliflower, dashi, sea beans- young hen and spot prawn, spinach, artichoke, chocolate-almond emulsionevery dish was presented excellent and tasted excellent. the combination of all the dishes were great. i've never seen any these dishes in another restaurant before! i recommend this place for anyone who is looking for good food and new food. the tables are a little close to each other tho but that's the case in a lot of restaurant these days too! i hope you enjoy your meal as much as i did!!!, 'Ie been getting some good karma lately with respect to scoring hard-to-get reservations. The latest one? The much-touted Commonwealth, where I got a primo 8pm reso one day in advance. Whoo hoo! The restaurant offers a $60 tasting menu as well as selections via a la carte. We went with the latter and got the following:- Shishito peppers with goat cheese - 4.5* (nice texture of roasted peppers and creamy cheese. delish).- Crispy pig ears - 3* (tastes like chicharrones; light and airy; but after a few bites, the greasiness and the fact that I was eating pig ears got to me. Oh well, at least I tried them!)- Compressed watermelon with wild greens - 5* (amazing! simply, the perfect summer dish. The compressed red and yellow melon cubes exploded with flavor and accompanying peppery arugula and mixed greens, candied nori and razor-thin cucumber slices worked really well, although the tofu foam was rather bland).- Potato gnocchi with corn, maitake mushrooms, parmesan and truffle oil - 4* (love this hearty combo of mushroom sauce and gnocchi - this was the perfect autumn dish. The gnocchi, while delicious, was almost too soft and mushy. Probably better gnocchi at Heirloom Cafe or Frances but this is was still really good).- Marrow stuffed squid with tamarind pork and shelling beans - 4* (such an unusual take on surf & turf but it worked. The portion for this dish was notably smaller, especially since it placed askew on such a large plate; the only I thing I would have preferred was to have something other than the beans as the mushy texture was too close to the squid/marrow and something a bit crunchier, like asparagus or squash, would have given it a nice contrast).- Young hen and spot prawn with spinach, artichoke and chocolate-almond emulsion - 4.5* (wow, the medallions of hen were so tender it blew me away. The prawns, once you remove the heads, are really quite small so the dish looks to be a lot bigger than it really is).While the portions were on the smaller side, that was fine because for a change, that gave us room to try desserts. We chose:- Cinnamon mille-feuille, cardamom marshmallow, burnt honey ice cream - 5* (I don have a sweet tooth but this was one of the best desserts Ie had in recent memory. The burnt honey ice cream is literally made from caramelizing the honey and using liquid nitrogen (our server checked with the chef on this). It was so good on its own but when you have it with the mille-feuille (complete the flaky phyllo dough and dense chocolate) and contrasted with the marshmallow), it was like a fancy smore!- White Russian dessert with vodka gelee, raw milk mousse, genoise (Italian sponge) cake and coffee ice cream) - 4* (on its own, this would have been a top dessert but it had the misfortune of being tasted right after the mille-feuille. Love the explosions of vodka when the gelee bursts in your mouth. So creative!Had a nice $40 bottle of their cabernet franc that worked well, especially with the heavier dishes. This is definitely a place I would be excited to return to ... especially because the tasting menu had dishes not offered a la carte (foie gras, abalone, chilled squash soup, hangar steak). Oh, and loved the window in the ceiling through which you can see exposed wooden beans and a disco ball. Nice touch!Definitely one of my new favorites.', Tasty food and wonderful presentation. My favorites are the shishito peppers with goat cheese, watermelon salad and white russian. There's parking lot next to the restaurant if you arrive early before spaces are taken. That's definitely a treat for the city!, 'I really liked Commonwealth and it did indeed leave me some great, memorable dishes. The concept of the restaurant is unique (Commonwealth - for the good of the people...and they in fact donate $ from each tasting menu to charity).Prices are good with everything costing $15 or less per dish if you do go with the a la carte option. However, you will probably have to get two dishes per person if you do a la carte since the dishes are small and meant to be shared.The tasting menu is $60, and although it looked outstanding (with 6 different dishes), I was a little disappointed to see that everything on the tasting menu was actually not available on the a la carte menu.Next time, will definitely opt for the tasting menu since it makes each dish average out to only $10 each and they actually donate $10 from each tasting menu to a local non-profit.Ambiance is nice and cozy, pretty small but large enough for a great date or small group outing. It is in a little sketchy area of the Mission so I would recommend parking in their private lot =)'|1
16|daniel-new-york|Daniel Boulud's midtown namesake is over the top in all regards - the decoration includes gilded columns and Bernardaud china, the food is extremely rich and often lacked balance, the service is impeccable and flawless. Of course, you have to pay for all this over-the-topness. I wasn't overly impressed with the food, and this is not my scene (I enjoy more laid-back environments paired with fantastic food). Definitely a dining experience. I wouldn't go back with so many other great restaurants in the city., The best meal of my life. The tasting menu was absolutely amazing, heightened only by the wine that so well matched every dish. A life changing experience, really. Every bite was a burst of flavor, and they serve just enough to tease you and leave you wanting more. I can't say enough good things about this place. Save money. Then go. It's worth it., 'There are not enough superlatives to describe the food, atmosphere, or experience of dining at Daniel in NYC.As you step into the luxurious space, you are instantly welcomed by an incredible staff who understand what it means to be a Relais & Chateaux/Relais Gourmands restaurant. There is a lounge area above and adjacent to the bar where you can eat a full menu, comfortably seated in beautifully upholstered sofas and chairs - with perfect people watching positions.There were people to watch (yes I will get to the food) on this Friday evening - Justice Scalia (not a favorite) with 20 military men in tow in black tie and formal military garb including hundreds of service medals, accompanied by the Senator from Virginia, John Warner. Yanni was in the dining room. Unfortunately Diddy was not to be found in his favorite dining tent, nor in the Chef table overlooking the kitchen.The FOOD: the gluttony was overwhelming, but all of the food delicate and wonderfully flavored. The presentation was spectacular and of course the service superlative. Among the delights we sampled:Tai Snapper Ceviche with Kumquat Coulis, Watercress, Tomato Compote and a Radish Salad, then Tuna Tartar with Fresh Wasabi and Oscetra Caviar Crisp Cucumber, Watermelon Radish and Meyer Lemon Coulis, then Scottish Pheasant Terrine with ChestnutsMedjool Dates, Poached Quince and Hazelnut-Mche Salad, a claybaked Salmon filet that was so wonderful to watch them serve, and Pan Roasted Scottish Grouse Stuffed with Foie Gras, Sweet Potato Pure, Glazed Salsify and a Huckleberry Jus, then an amazing cheese course served expertly by John Winterman (formerly of Gary Danko in SF), and we ended with a delicious Chocolate Caramel Millefeuille with Vanilla Confiture de Lait Fleur de Sel Caramel Ice Cream!Ignace Lecleir is the GM of Daniel and he is the best of the best! Formerly of Gary Danko in SF, Ignace is the ultimate professional, making guests feel comfortable, and fluent in several languages, as is most of the staff.This is THE place for a romantic dinner!', 'We had a lovely meal here. i especially loved the cheese cart and the 89 Chateau Latour.', 'This will likely always be on my Top 3 list of New York restaurants. The last time here, I tried their vegetarian prix fixe menu.The service is unpretentious yet curiously effective--has to be experienced to be believed. Wait staff magically appear from nowhere when you take your gaze off your companions or your food.The salad, the mushroom soup, the ravioli--all cooked to perfection. And the hot chocolate souffle with pistachio ice cream--wish it were healthy and I could eat that every day, twice a day of course.If you are in the mood to splurge on a special occasion, there might not be a better place in the city.', 'As Stradivarius is to stringed instruments, Shakespeare to playwrights and Ichiro to Japanese baseball players, so Daniel is to other restaurants. It that good. My lovely wife and I decided to try it after reading a review by Ruth Reichi, the incredibly knowledgeable and rigorous New York Times food critic. In a wonderful piece of deliberate understatement she calls it quite a ride and awards a very rare but coveted four stars. I can only agree. A cheap ride, though, it is not. We ordered the five course tasting at $132, with wine flight for an additional $65. With taxes and tip the total came to $600 for the two of us. There is also an eight-course Grand Tasting for $175 paired with a $85 wine flight. Had we ordered a bottle or two from the list I sure we could have easily spent $500-700 a person. Service was, as other Yelper note, absolutely wonderful. Expensive French restaurants often forget that their function is making guests happy. I can believe I the only one who fears that a badly pronounced order for Vichyssoise or Soupe Daricot (bean soup) will lead to a deep if slightly smirking bow and an under-the-breath Je vais vous apporter de lau de vaiselle sale. Vous ne verrez aucune difference (I will bring you dirty dish water, you will never know the difference). Have no fear of that at Daniel. The staff manages to be friendly without feeling phony, knowledgeable without a trace of condensation and always available without being obsequious. The food and wine pairings were absolutely incomparable. Rather than try to describe them myself I urge you to read what other Yelpers say, read Ruth Reichl review (its contained in the book Garlic and Sapphires), or best of all, try it yourself. My only regret is not having dressed better. Daniel requires men wear a coat, and I did. However, it was with a California business casual set of Khakis and a polo shirt.. The restaurant is very carefully laid out to have no bad tables, but I couldn help but feel that our table along the outer periphery was ever so slightly less equal than others. I also noticed we were next to another table of younger and less formally dressed people, so likely better clothes do mean a better table. However, I wished I dressed better mainly because I want to show respect to the restaurant and the truly remarkable experience it provides.', OK, heresy, perhaps, but Daniel is not all that. Michelin knows what they're doing and didn't give Daniel 3 stars. I'm giving them less. Note though, that this 3 stars is only relative to other top flight restaurants, not to the Yelp 3-star rated Thai down the street.Now, having said that, here's why I don't think Daniel is up to snuff: (1) brusque service -- just too rote. Dish descriptions were recited as if making a classroom presentation, (2) food uses just way too much flavor enhancer; yes, the dreaded msg or equivalent (yes, I know that the chef's trademark technique has a lot of intense reductions, and yes, certainly flavor comes from that, but you can't argue with the trademark apres-meal thirsty all night feeling after eating too much msg), (3) their wine pairing pours are way too meager for the price (4) surely they can redo their chair upholstery every now and then. This is my 2nd visit to Daniel, seated at the same table (not sure if that was by design or accident). It is a very handsome room, of course, very nicely decorated, but the one thing I took away from my 2nd visit was that the corners of all the chairs, where they're pulled out and pushed in for the guests, are all very visibly worn. In regards to service, it is certainly very dependent on who you get, more like, which team you get. On my first visit, we had a pretty engaging fellow. On this most present visit, we had a cold fish who seemed just to go through the required motions of his job. Certainly, one has to take different personalities into account, but a top rate place like Daniel shouldn't suffer from such wide differences in perceived service friendliness/professionalism.The food. It's certainly good, and presented very well, with some interesting flavors and combinations, but ... stale bread was offered, and there were more misses than hits (both times we had the tasting menu), with some dishes verging on the bland.Maybe this 2nd visit was an off day, but that's the thing. This calibre of restaurant should not have off days., 'Although the atmosphere can be a bit on the older and stuffy side, the food and service is impeccable. If you are looking for a fine dining experience in Manhattan, I highly recommend Daniel. Dinner usually takes several hours but the beautifully decorated dining room as well as the attentive and well versed staff make it a great experience. I love how they bring out the fresh mini madelines and tiny chocolates at the end. A nice finish to a great meal. (Please do not order the foie gras though! The way they treat the geese to get the foie gras is despicable!)', 'It was a fine meal... from what I can remember.Alright, alright, that sounded incredibly snotty of us to be slagginon a top-rated restaurant, but hear us out before you shoot us for god sake! The setting/decor is elegant, service was attentive and helpful (if a bit stuffy. In fact, I think our waiter actually HAD a stick up his ass), and the food was expertly prepared and tasty. So why only 4 stars? Well to tell the truth, we can remember any damn specifics of our meal at Daniel! Let see... caviar this, foie gras that, ummmm I think we had beef. Or was it rabbit? You see what I getting at? Perhaps wee just too modern and part of the whipper-snapper generation that can appreciate traditional French fare. I suppose if wee the generation with a microsecond attention-span, then Daniel would be akin to the grandparent you always liked, but kinda wanted to minimize your time with because they smelled funny.', Like Lynn says, this is a place to go for special occassions.It's suuuuuper pricey. It's quite the experience. The staff is incredible.I've been here twice and had a truly decadent dining experience both times. I highly recommend going to Daniel if you can afford it. If not, save up for it and go when you can--it's actually worth the high prices in my opinion., Simply a paragon of fine dining here in the city. There's no two ways about it. Our boss took the team here after an unusually rough project that had stretched for a few months - he made the mistake of allowing me to pick any restaurant in the city to go to for a celebratory dinner ;-)Everything is executed exceptionally. From the moment you step in, you are simply taken aback by the gorgeous, ornate decor (generally not my aesthetic, but works well here) and unbelievable service. As soon as you walk in, you are promptly seated in the waiting area as your drink orders are taken and almost immediately brought out to you with various breads, crackers and nuts to ready your palette for the masterpieces you are about to consume. As soon as your table in the main dining room is ready, you are escorted by what feels like your own personal team of waiters out to a table in a gorgeous dining room with spectacular chandeliers and high ceiling. Once seated, you are treated to a wide array of tasty amuse-bouches which you only stop munching on to admire your surroundings, the multi-volume encyclopedic wine list and tremendous menu.Once you've ordered, your food is brought out by a team of waiters in a flourish, only adding to the terrifically theatrical element of it all. Our table, which had been abuzz with conversation until now, basically quieted down to silence as everyone looked wide-eyed and mouth-wateringly at the food -- no one said a word as we all dug in, and was it ever worth it.Deserts are rich and decadent, preceded of course by a tray of small cookies, truffles and toffees. The whole experience was second to none -- and you would hope so for the price. Certainly on the more expensive side of things, but certainly worth it if you are shelling out for an occasion or important gathering. In my opinion, one of the hallmarks of a great restaurant is not just great food, or just great atmosphere or just great service, but how well each of these elements can be executed in sync (and not at the expense) of the others. Daniel does a phenomenal job of marrying these components of fine dining into a seamless experience for the senses, and I left not the least bit disappointed. Well done., 'Very nice room. The staff tries to give fine dining service but, alas, the timing was off and the staff was too busy working the large parties to give our $580 deuce any attention--certainly not $600 worth.This is poseur fine dining, at best.', It's been a while since I ate here so I'm not going to write much other than that I really enjoyed it. I do remember a couple things that stood out to me: the wine list is much huger than the menu, the waiter guy had an incredibly thick french accent (it was almost satirical), the main dining room is actually quite large and noisy, and we had a chock full of courses (I left full) and they definitely aim to please you. Whether you are a baller or a mini-baller, I highly recommend Daniel for all to try at least once., What an experience!! My husband made reservations here for my birthday dinner and I don't think I'll be forgetting it anytime soon. I was in awe as soon as I stepped in - felt like I had been transported to another country and was longer in NYC. They give you a little stool for your purse! Maybe I haven't been around much, but that was awesome =) Oh, and since when does the waiter practically walk you to the restroom when you ask where it is? I'm an enchiladas kinda girl so the food was far above the level I'm used to - I enjoyed some of it but I wasn't drooling over it. The dessert, however, I will remember forever. I ordered a souffle which was rich and delicious - so rich that I couldn't finish it - and that NEVER happens! They also brought out a little dessert for my birthday which was adorable. After we thought we could eat no more, they brought out a plate of little mini dessert pieces and then fresh mini madeleines! Those were mindblowing.So that's my perspective of the place as a newly turned 26 year old =), 'what a pretty restaurant. went with a couple of friends and had the tasting menu with the flight of wine. everything was good good good. portions were perfect. and the staff is all above average looking which is always nice.', I found this to offer very average food in a very pretentious atmosphere. Having dined in such restaurants as Alinea in Chicago, Gary Danko in SF, etc., this restaurant lags far behind in terms of both service and the quality of food when compared to comparable restaurants around the country. I was so looking forward to this experience and was profoundly disappointed . There are too many other places in NY that deserve your money over this one.One very bright spot was the bar. The service was phenomenal. Our female bartender, who's name I cannot remember, offered us tastings of various vodka's as we were not familiar with all their selections. (Would it really be that difficult for them to stock Jewel of Russia?) Anyway, the bar service was great.Another plus was the layout of the room. I do appreciate that they do not have tables on top of each other, trying to maximize revenue. And the desserts where phenomenal.But, as for dinner, very average food. If you are nouveau riche however, this would be the perfect place for you to try and impress your equally uneducated friends and waste your money., i had a little lunch at daniel today. it was perfect.the table water tasted so good i was going to ask what it was. then i saw the evian bottles. mystery solved.the dining room was big and open and airy, with a surrounding mezzanine. a glance at the bar as i came in made me want to go there but i was already late.it was a function so the room was filled with big round tables. no matter. when they took the first plates away, i was sad. i hadn't had a chance to properly look at them, they seemed to be a beautiful pattern of yellow and white. i was instead facing the other way, listening to the presentation. not a bad presentation. but i knew the food was coming.there were three rolls, one at a time like a little 3-course bread meal, each one more unique and delicious than the one before. and of course that french butter. who needs food when the bread and butter are exquisite. but there was food. white wine, crisp and dry and icy cold and with that champagne sweatsox aroma. it sounds funny to describe it that way but that's what it was like. it was delish. scallops grilled on the outside, slightly raw inside, with shredded mushrooms exalted with flavor like a punch to the forehead and little vegetation knicknacks, each a different color and shape and taste, a little sauce, delish. a plate with a pair of meat medalions, one a tenderloin and one a braised beef that melted under the fork. a dollop of creamed potato, another set of vegetation knicknacks, each tiny bit of everything exquisite. perfect. charming. with a red wine. dry and spicy and somehow transparent going down.warm molten chocolate cake paired with thick pistachio ice cream. it was so good we had no idea it was pistachio. i thought lychee green tea concoction. jasmine. juniper. it was pistachio. geez. not too much to eat, not too little to eat. plenty to taste, a carnival of mouthwatering theater.this is the real deal, in its prime. daniel. ya mon!, BEST MEAL I'VE EVER EATEN. EVER. Zero exaggeration. Went there on New Year's Eve last year and maybe it was just that it was an exceptional night, but I really don't think it was just that. My bf had some chicken consomme and later maybe a duck plate with a pomegranate glaze. I had a delicious meal, but all I can even remember of it was the amazing Kobe beef trio. Three squares of heaven I will never forget that meal. The service was perfect and the place was too. If you are ever near it, it's completely worth the splurge., Service? INSANE. The guy brought out a little stool for my handbag.Thanks for noticing my Theory handbag I got on sale. I bet your stool was more expensive.Food was great but nothing was super memorable...but maybe that's because I drank a lot of wine.Met Daniel when we were leaving the restaurant...very nice man.Varied crowd...didn't feel like I stuck out so much like when I went to Le Bernadin where my boyfriend and I were the youngest people in the room. More fashionable people than other nicer restaurants. It was like looking at a fashion magazine at a restaurant setting.(4 stars because I can't remember what I ate at all but somehow I know what I wore that night), By far the best restaurant I've eaten at yet. I took my girl here for her 30th birthday and we were both impressed by the level of service and quality of food. Daniel is housed in a beautiful space. Decorated elegantly, it sets the mood for the dining experience you are about to partake in. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and professional and helped us choose a wine. He didn't seem the least bit annoyed after we changed our minds on the selection and opted to start with champagne instead. Just be mindful of the prices. It's very easy to be persuaded into a bottle of wine through the guidance of a trained professional only to realize you agreed to a $300 bottle of wine!Our waiter was a burly guy with a shaved head (kind of intimidating at first) but turned out to be a super nice guy. He helped us choose our courses and we were very pleased. We had the duck dish and veal prepared four different ways. Everything was delicious. We were talking about our experience for days after.A must go for a special occasion (it aint cheap!)., I had hyped this place up big time in my mind so maybe that is why it only gets 4 stars. It's delicious, I love the amuse bouche, I didn't love the bread presentation, I don't know it felt cheesy to me. I did love the seating and the carpeted floors. I did love the wine even though I didn't get the tasting. I did not love the people sitting next to me. They must have been in real estate and sold a huge property or something because they calculated out their pay and then spent the night discussing what they would spend it on. ( I, oddly enough, was not on their list)I would go here for a special occasion, like a job promotion or an anniversary but I don't think I'd just pop in for wednesday night dinner, not that I could without reservations., 'If you are trying to decide on a special restaurant for an event, Daniel is similar to most top rated New York restaurants. You can expect an emphasis on decor, service and food. I would not say Daniel is or is not the spot for a certain special night. The experience did not stand out among others in its caliber. In other words, it was pretty much the same no better no worse. There are many excellent 5 star restaurants with detailed play by play reviews, it is truly a matter of taste and what you find makes one more special than the other i.e. atmosphere, crowd, music. Here is what made Daniel stand out to me, more than other restaurants in its class:1. Unlimited Tea Refills: Not just hot water poured over tea leaves/bag, but a fresh pot poured into your cup every time you finish your last sip.No extra charge. **This is the only reason I gave it 5 stars (otherwise it gets 3) - great tasting fresh tea is a luxury to me. 2. Mind reading Ability of Staff Without Hovering: Whether its more tea, bread or anything else you desire, they are ready and waiting. 3. Best Meat Dish: Duo of Dry Aged Beef4. Desert whether you order it or not: Freshly baked basket full of Madeleines lightly powdered with sugar plus Petit Fours..5. Friendly Hard Working Chef6. Drawing-room area with Bar: Great entrance/feeling when you first walk in. Bar area is Truly something special, feels old world and classy - for some, this alone may be worth a visit. Expansive, high ceilings, private-feeling late night.', Hands down, the best meal I've ever had. This place has it all. It really is a special occasion place. I envy anyone who comes here on a regular basis.The level of service is unsurpassed. The staff is extremely aware of everything that is going on, and will cater to your every need, even if you're not expecting it. My purse even had a chair the whole night. That's quality.The selection of breads (and endless supply) was enough to win over a carb fan like me. But that was just the beginning. The amuse-bouche was just beautiful and delicious. A true work of culinary art. I chose the heirloom tomato app, which came in five versions. Loved it. Boyfriend had the lobster ravioli. Delish. For entrees, he had the veal four ways; I had the duck two ways. Then the outpouring of desserts began. Though I went up a pants size the next day, it was worth it. And it will be worth it anytime I go back. Daniel Boulud, you are my hero., By far the best french meal that I've had. The attention to detail in this restaurant is fantastic. The wine list, the bread basket, the service and, of course, the food are all above and beyond what you'd find in any other restaurant (other than in the city, other than perhaps Per Se)., My wife and I went to Daniel this week for a private event. Visa Signature hosted a four-course dinner with wine pairings from Davis Bynum (Sonoma - Russian River Valley). The first course was a delicious squash soup, followed by a grilled halibut, then grilled lamb chop/braised lamb and finally a sweet fig dessert. While I was very impressed with the service and the food, it wasn't the best meal or probably even in my top ten best meals. We were happy to try and but I probably wouldn't go back unless it was for a business function of some kind. The only complaint I had was that the room was way too hot (it had been almost 80 degrees in October that day!)., 'My husband and I celebrated our anniversary dinner here. Service was flawless. Food was decadent. And, dessert was heavenly. We were wonderfully surprised by the warm madelines at the end of the meal. Plus, the waiter made sure our night was extra special by decorating our dessert plate with Happy Anniversary!Pros: Ambiance, Food, & WineCons: Too damn expensive', 'I came to Daniel with very high expectations, having read the book The Fourth Star (yes, I that much of a foodie nerd that I spend my non-eating time reading books about eating) in advance.For the most part, my expectations were met, if not exceeded.First off, the restaurant itself is gorgeous, and I would not be exaggerating if I said that it was the most beautiful dining room these eyes have laid upon. The scene was right out of a five-star hotel - lush draperies, high ceilings, all of the furnishings first rate.My eatinbuddies and I went for the six-course fall tasting menu, for the low, low price of $165 per head (Dorothy, wee not in McDonald anymore). With a couple of exceptions, the meal was spectacular, and extremely ample. Before the first course is served, a trio of excellent amuse bouches were served, along with a bread basket bursting with at least six or seven varieties of artisinal yeasty delights. Needless to say, I was full before the appetizers came out. I will not run through all of the courses, but they were great. Given that this was a multi-course meal, I was quite frankly surprised at how large each of the courses were. And then, there was dessert. Oh. My. God. I had this chocolate mousse cake that was simply exceptional. Despite being so full that I contemplated going straight to the emergency room to have my stomach pumped, I delved into the sweet, soft, lemony fresh-baked madelines served after dessert with reckless abandon. But wait, there more. Following the madelines, a wonderful assortment of chocolates and petit fours were served. And yes, despite having eaten my body weight already, I dug in.Oh, I forgot, a cheese course was involved as well. Maybe the best cheeses Ie ever eaten (and anyone who knows me knows that I consume a hell of a lot of it).The only reason I give Daniel 4 stars is (1) a couple of the dishes just didn quite make the grade and (2) it is expensive beyond all notions of reasonableness. That said, if you got a stack of benjamins burning a hole in your pocket, give Daniel a go.', Daniel is hands down my favorite dining experience of the year. The food marvelous, the service on point, the company delightful, and the atmosphere abuzz with that magical sparkle that only comes around when temperatures dip.I could wax poetic about how each morsel of food was like a celebration in my mouth; that the wine was delicate yet rich, light yet consuming; that my date was engaging and interesting; and that the service was both ubiquitous and obsequious - but I won't, because my words will be wasted. For those who have not yet had the immense pleasure of dining at Daniel may not appreciate them (as I would not have, before going there myself). Those who are lucky enough to have been can just travel back in their mind's eye and relive the glorious meal, rather than hear my recantation. Daniel is a truly memorable experience - a beautiful bombardment of your olfactory and gustatory senses. My only advice: take it slow and enjoy each glorious act of the symphony that becomes your meal; and the experience will be embedded into your memory forever.5 stars, sans doute., My experience at Daniel was magical. Sitting in the middle of the dining room enjoying a tasting menu with wine pairings feels like the way Manhattan should feel in all it's glamor. Except I am there for the food and the wine, not the vanities. The only other two restaurants I have found to equate at this level in the US, our the French Laundry and Le Bernardin. I dream of eating here again. I just need to get my hands on a plane ticket, a hotel and about $650.00 for the food and wine. This place is why I have financial problems.Gastronomy at it's finest!!!, Fantastic! We had a wonderful dining experience at Daniel and THAT is what it is... an experience. They waited on us hand and foot. Bring your appetite... the food just keeps coming but don't worry the portions aren't ginormous. The wine list is HUGE. One thing I really appreciated was that it wasn't pretentious. It was certainly elegant but not to the point that you're afraid to speak above a whisper because there is a certainly comfortable idle chatter level that keeps you feeling loose and not stuffy., Definitely the best food I've ever tasted. Tastes even better if Daddy is paying., 'Best meal of my entire life. Period.', Absolute one of the greatest experience I've had in fine dining. I was visiting NYC and my friend gave me two restaurant choices to pick from. I really wanted to try this restaurant after visiting their website. The host was very nice and courtesy when I made my reservation for the wrong date. The interior of the restaurant was very elegant and classy. This is a place where you can be yourself and still have the high class service. My friend and I did dress up for this dinner and it made it even better. I think we were the youngest table that night probably because the elder couples can afford these kind of meal more often.Try the tasting menu when you're there. It's totally worth trying different dishes. Words can't even describe my experience. Hands down, this was one of my favorite dining experience along with French Laundry., Every year on his birthday, my friend chooses his favorite person and a great restarant to ring in the occasion. For his 32nd year, I was the chosen one and the restaurant was Daniel. We arrived for a 7:30 reservation, had a drink at the bar (which is lovely) and went to our table.As everyone has mentioned, the dining room is amazing. That said, we were given a not-so-great table right by the doors to the kitchen (NOTE: If possible, ask for a table in the inner part of the dining room). I was put off by this.The menu is a little overwhelming and in the end we opted for the 6-course tasting option. Everything was good; only 2 dishes were great: the lobster and the beef (can't remember the cut). The first course was a choice between foie gras done one way and foie gras done another way. My friend does not like foie gras and when he asked for a substitute, his only option was salad (this is lame, no?). Also note, that we had both the lamb and beef dishes and the beef was the definite winner.We ordered wines by the glass since it was only two of us and we weren't sure how much we'd drink. The house white wine is great and cheap at something like $13 a glass. We should have gotten a bottle because most of the dishes were fish and we didn't switch over to red until late in the meal.Desserts were okay. Along with the main dessert they give petits fours and madelines. The madelines were so delicious, warm, light and tasty, we asked for more (Why not?).In the end at $600 for two, I can't give Daniel more that 3 stars. I would have liked it more if we had gotten a better table and if I had been wise enough to know that the three-course option with lobster and beef (don't know if that's actually possible) is all you need to eat and experience what is good at Daniel. A note about wine: the waiter told us that every year Daniel goes to California to taste wines and decides what to serve at his establishment. Don't be scared of the house wines.Next time (if there is a next time), I'll ask for a better table and go for the three-course menu instead of the six., 'How far back can I yelp?Date: October 2001Time: LunchPlace: Daniel on the Upper East SideCharacters: A Group of older, mature, wealthy Park Avenue socialites, all garden club friends. A random girl I just met a few weeks ago but am crashing at her parents house and an 18 years old Allison. Okay, she was not that random, she was in my unit, a fellow Marine.

You are coming with me Free food. I was down.I went shopping specifically for this restaurant. Thought I looked sharp in a pair of black pants and a nice button down shirt from no other but Forever 21. No Miuccia Prada for me, not yet. I had a seafood dish. I believe it was sea bass. It was quite tasty.The crowd was older. Looked very Bold and the Beautiful-ish. Was I in a soap opera? Nope, just lunch with the ladies from the Upper East Side.The waiter was adorable. A french boy that we were both crushing over through out the entire meal. We got his digits. We never called.Highlight of the entire afternoon was that I was able to drink. They do not card. Left the restaurant with a nice buzz. Exactly what one needed after an 72 hour work shift.Daniel, you were my first real restaurant experience in New York City. For that you forever have a place in my heart.', Exremely attentive waitstaff, obviously extensive and excellent wine selections. The dining room is the kind of place grandma takes you for your birthday - definitely not a lot of hootin' and hollerin'. The bar/lounge is about my speed, though I was here on a business dinner and we were all studiously avoiding staring at the canoodling and drunk middle aged couples.I would say it is a lovely experience in itself, though I did not find the food to be worth the expense. Go ahead, call me unsophisticated and send me back to Brooklyn., 'Classy. If I had to sum my experience to one word classy would be it. My boyfriend surprised me when I was in NY visiting family and I would have to say he has lots of class as well.I had the three course tasting menu. I loved everything from their amuse bush to the Madeline cookies at the end. Service was exceptional and its very French when it comes to their division of labor. They had the maitre d, sommelier, drinks person, demi-chef, the bread guy, cookie guy... I think about 20 people came by our table. Our main server or our Serveur de restaurant looked like a prada model an was really well spoken but very stiff. Anyhow, back to foodamuse bush- what a great way to start. everything was so great i couldn get enough and couldn wait for my 1st course to startrose martini- best martini ever- i think the rose pedal ice they created is pleasing to the eye1st course-lobster melted in my mouth2nd course- my date had the Black Sea Bass: had to try it because it was so classic and it really was amazingI had venison and it was cooked to perfection, not gamey at alldessert- OMG this place really really out did themselves on dessert. I thought it was sooo goodPetits Fours- really cute and delicious even after your dessert has been demolishedMadeline cookies- warm and perfectly made. you have to takes these home with youAll in all i was blown away. I think portions are HUGE and I came out very full which is rare for pretentious restaurants. I can wait to visit this New York institution again.', 'Daniel offers the most extensive vintages and selections of premire and grand Cru Boudreaux than any other restaurant by a large margin. it defines what a 4 star restaurant in New York constitutes - prestigious reputation, grandeur dcor, polished service, elegant and exceptional cuisine. Out of all the 4 star restaurants, Daniel is the most well rounded choice, avoid of overwhelming courses at per se, the occasional aloof atmosphere at Le Bernardin, or the complete overrating of Masa and Jean Georges. Make sure you dress to impress, but in good taste and enjoy the evening.', 'This was the dining experience of my life! Everything was outstanding, just as what other reviewers are saying there were about 10 people that waited on us...hell, they even walked me to the bathroom, talk about service. The room itself was gorgeous and the people watching was outstanding. We were seated at the far left of the dining room and sat at a table that overlooked everything. We felt like we were on the set of American Psycho though, and eating the best food wee ever tried. The other diners were exactly what we think of when we categorize people as american psycho cast. They had amazing clothes and fake British accents and faked kissed each other cheeks and then rolled their eyes about their friends when they weren looking. It wasn about the atmosphere as much as the whole experience though, all wraped up into one, this was my favorite night in a long long time. Il probably never go back though b/c it against my religion for 2 people to spend close to $600 on dinner.', At long last I got to experience Daniel! I had wanted to dine here for a few years now, and basically everything I could ask for -- fine dining, great wine, nice cocktails, IMPECCABLE service, and sophisticated decor. The food is all clasically prepared and delicious, but I'm sorry to say that little of it was memorable. Oh, it was fine alright - but it was not one of those meals that you remembered. The only thing that really struck me were the freshly baked madeleines served at the very end of the meal. Honestly, some of the food was a bit too over-stylized, and ended up not being that tasty. My chocolate dessert was expertly sculpted, but didn't seem to melt in my mouth. There was some moussey petit four that was actually a bit gross too.... Oh, I hate to say such words when I have such high respect for Mr. Boulud!Speaking of which - I did get to shake his hand when I left that evening, and I loved that he was there in spite of having just opened a new restaurant a few months ago. The ultimate point about Daniel will be the service and decor -- here your purse will never touch the ground (they will give it its own footstool), and you can have complete privacy in some of the tables set off to the side in its own tented area. Somehow this is not overly-pretentious to me -- and a big plus - no bathroom attendant (hate those!)., The dining room is absolutely beautiful, the service is impeccable, and we were given the pleasure of a tour of their kitchen (which was the cleanest kitchen I've ever seen in my life) by Daniel Boloud himself.But I have to agree with a previous poster - the food was classic and delicious, but not all that memorable!The one thing I really do remember are the madeleines. Sweet Jesus, I've never tasted anything as light, as airy, as bursts of sweet crumbly heaven as those warm madeleines., 'Daniel offers the most extensive vintages and selections of premire and grand Cru Boudreaux than any other restaurant by a large margin. it defines what a 4 star restaurant in New York constitutes - prestigious reputation, grandeur dcor, polished service, elegant and exceptional cuisine.

Make sure you dress to impress, but in good taste and enjoy the evening.', I don't get the hype. It was a nice dinner and a nice dining room, to be sure, but seriously way overpriced.We got the tasting menu, ordering one of each offering. Of each course, only one was good. Maybe I don't appreciate foie gras enough, sue me.I did like the fact that we got little fresh baked madeleines and truffles with our dessert, but otherwise, it was ho hum and too stuffy for my taste., 'Nothing spectacular or creative. Just your run of the mill good restaurant. The food is better and cheaper at Cafe Boulud.', 'Fabulous food, fabulous wine, the dessert is to die for. Specifically the piping hot madelines that are served as a final farewell for the evening and the sick start of a love affair. I think about you way too much.', I heart Daniel...The food was wonderful, excellent wine, delicious desserts and treats, but above all the service was astounding. This was hands down the best dining experience I EVER had. Everything was timed to perfection and perfectly orchestrated. Food arrived one after the next and glasses stayed full. They even noticed that it was my birthday when I opened up my present. Without even asking they gave us a little extra something. I would have been delighted with a slab of cake or ice cream, but that wouldn't meet Chef Boulud's standards. I'm pretty sure it was a full night, but it felt we were the only table in the room. It was that good., the best meal that i've ever had in my LIFE (and i'm not exagerating here.) i don't eat at a lot of very high cuinse places like this, but i've been to a few, and nothing has compared to this place! every dish that i had impressed me, and a couple of them qualified as 'heaven on a plate.' we had the seven course tasting menu with wine pairings. especially notable were the langustine plate, and the lamb chop, (my partner thought the meat flavor was a bit strong, but i thought it was perfectly cooked and had fantastic flavor). and yes, the madeleines were such a beautiful surprise, and a nice end to a fantastic culinary feast the likes of which could be prepared by babette herself. best of all, even though i ate my fill, i didn't feel overly stuffed or acidy afterwards, even considering the wine! i almost feel bad putting this in the same eschelon as a couple of the other places that i gave 5 stars., this was an absolute joy of a meal! we were eagerly waiting to eat here and chef daniel boulud did not disappoint! the restaurant is easy to find as it is at the corner of 65th and park ave. the entrance is a nice revolving door and as soon as you enter you are greeted and asked if you are dining in the main dining hall (you can stay and order food in the bar area as well). the staff is incredibly attentive and very helpful. the best part is that there is no sense of pretentiousness at all.we got seated in an area overlooking the majority of the dining room so it was perfect for people watching. also, we were seated very closely to the kitchen which was good for the most part. the downside to sitting so close was that the first few courses came out quite quickly.here's the course by course breakdown:amuse bouche:canapes - we had lil bite sized portions of a beet w/ candied pecans, ratatouille w/ eggplant caviar, parmesan cup and a small asparagus custard type thing. we liked each of the bites especially the beet and the parmesan cup.course #1:me - pistachio crusted foie gras terrine. this was accompanied w/ a bit of rhubarb and a gelee. i was also given 2 pieces of brioche toast to help scarf all of this down. absolutely outstanding!her - frisee salad with jumbo asparagus, aged balsamic. she thought was pretty goodcourse #2:me - seared yellowfin tuna with a anchovy puree, raw veggies, roe and a crouton. this very very good but the tuna was a bit tough to cut.her - watercress veloute w/ ricotta dumplings. this was accompanied with some glazed parsnips. this dish looked very good and she thought it was very tasty as well though she thought the veloute was a bit salty. i tasted it and thought it was exquisite. very complex.course #3:me - sea scallop with a zucchini type pastry and coriander-tomato marmalade. this was my favorite dish of the night. perfectly cooked and the zucchini portion was very nice!her - spinach subric with roquefort cheese cream sauteed porcinis, shallot confit. this dish was best when all the parts were eaten together otherwise it tasted like you were just eating spinach or a croquette. together, it tasted unreal.course #4:me - zaatar spiced swordfish w/ chickpea panisse, baba ganoush. i enjoyed this more than the tuna dish. very tasty and all the components went nicely together.her - potato gnocchi w/ fava beans, pencil asparagus, morels. this was very good but very heavy too. i had a bite and thought it was done brilliantly.course #5:me - duo of dry aged beef: red wine braised short ribs w/ shallot confit and seared rib eye w/ spinach subric and sauteed porcinis. a great way to close off the tasting menu before dessert. the poured a jus on around the seared rib eye which elevated the flavor the of the beef. can't say too much else than wow.her - sweet pea-ricotta tortelloni w/ boston lettuce, chanterelles. a foam accompanied this dish too but we couldn't quite point out what it was a foam of. she liked everything about this dish but the chanterelles were not to her liking. i thought they were totally fine!course #6:me - tasting of mango: mango marinated in roasted sesame ginger, mango coulis, and mango sorbet. a very nice light end to a great meal. each of the components displayed the greatness that is mango very well. her - hazelnut mousse w/ a gianduja biscuit, milk chocolate and salted caramel ice cream. this was awesome. she easily could've eaten this for hours.suprise! - bittersweet chocolate-prailne w/ sponge cake and caraibe ice cream. they surprised us with an extra dessert! this pushed us over the edge but it was a good edge to be pushed over!mignardises:assortment of goodness - fresh baked madeleines, an assortment of sweets that included lil marshmallows and whole assortment of chocolates. great way to finish the meal.we both enjoyed the wine pairing too. each course really well paired and i would recommend doing it. at the end of the meal we also got to meet chef daniel boulud and he was a very nice and warm person. very friendly too! we even got a tour of the kitchen which was still quite busy around 10:30pm.i would put this experience up there with the french laundry and highly recommend daniel!, Everything was fabulous! It was my birthday so I don't know if I got special treatment but I absolutely loved it. The dinner was 3 courses. But I was stuffed. We also did the wine pairing which was very nice. The wines went very well with each course. I however would have probably liked 5 smaller courses versus 3 larger courses. Also I would have probably chosen the foie gras terrine instead of the mosaic of foie gras with veal cheeks. The hot madelines are out of this world!! Yummy!! I can't wait to go back., 'Easily one of the best meals of my life.I went for my B-day w/ family so I thankfully wasn paying. The service was impeccable, which is to be expected for the price. Everyone at the table had the three courses and no one was disappointed. For me, the standout was the Paupiette of Black Sea Bass, sea bass wrapped in a thin layer of potato. It was a perfectly balanced dish w/ perfectly prepared fish.Additionally, the amuse bouche, bread, madelines were also stellar. The desserts were amazing and they even brought out an extra one, that we hadn ordered, just for me because it was my birthday.Go, if only once, go. Yeah it insanely expensive but the place is really a near perfect dining experience.Also, I think it should be mentioned that unlike some of the other rockstar chefs Daniel Boulud ACTUALLY works in this Restaurant. Which is prob why they quality hasn deviated. Plus, I got to meet him and take pictures with him on my b-day. How kick ass is that?!?! As you can imagine I totally nerded out when I met him. It was the perfect end to a perfect evening.:)', Took Christopher here for his 30th BirthdayWe started off with 2 glasses of Dom Perignon. I know that sounds pretentious but just being there that was the only choice. I have never had Dom before and it was worth every penny. All 5600 per glass.The food was amazing. We did the tasting menu and split the choices. The only knock I have was the pacing. Some courses seemed rushed. I really wanted to savor the glass of Dom but before I know it the first course and wine was there. Some of the wine pairings were questionable. I don't mind taking risk if they work but there was one fish course that was paired with a red that fell on its face.The scene is stuffy and lots of old money. The interior is beautiful but the place could be intimating if you let it, 'There a nice French restaurant decor, and the food is very good, but it didn come off to me as measurably better than the other very good restaurants in this city.Appetizers:The Caramelized Sea Scallops  la Provencale are fantastic. Perfectly cooked scallops. The Kataifi Wrapped Langoustines were tasty, but I found them a bit uneven. The flavor was at times swamped out by the sauce and salt. Mains:The Paupiette of Black Sea Bass in a Crisp Potato Shell was a delight to look at, and quite tasty to boot.The Duo of Dry Aged Beef is supposed to be one of their famous dishes, but I found this one thoroughly average.Dessert:The Sauternes Glazed Peaches with Crd2me Bruld9e was quite tasty.The Chocolate Upside-Down Souffld9 is your standard nice restaurant Souffle.', we celebrated our 9th anniversary at Daniel this week.yes, it's expensive. yes, it may be intimidating. but i recommend it to anyone who is looking for an eponymous new york experience. most of the folks there were in their 40's and up (i'm guessing because you could easily spend at least $1K for a meal). the restaurant is beautiful, with a stately and grand interior. service was great. we loved our appetizers and desserts but weren't goo goo ga-ga over the entrees. we're dorks because we love that you can get unlimited refills of the iced tea. where else in nyc can you get refills? well, if you're gonna pay some serious cash you damn well better be getting some refills.overall, my wife gave our evening a 10 (she never gives out 10's) and i gave it an 8.at the end of the meal, the maitre 'd graciously agreed to our request of touring the kitchen and informed us that in August 2008, the restaurant would be getting a complete facelift. the renovation would be done by September 2008. do it., Transporting Experience -- Simply put, this place is theatre. Words do not do justice to the Daniel experience, from the unbelievable creativity of the food to the majestic feel of the dining room. And so I won't even try, though I will note to the ladies that they'll even have an extra stool waiting for your purse!, ' Comfort me with apples, for I am tired of lovea lot of us who write on these pages have reasons to be extremely grateful to Ruth Reichl, former restaurant critic of the greatest daily newspaper in the world. When she got the job in the early 90s she took on the poncey , fancy-schamnacey, pretentious restaurants and chefs and singlehandedly made them realize that their customer base was not necessarily the Richie Rich mob, but the normal mob, who will go on a splurge once or twice a year, and want the experience to be transcendent and celebratory, not pretentious or intimidating.This is exactly what Daniel delivers. My three favorite things:1. The night we were there the great man himself was in the entrance lobby, welcoming people and thanking them for coming. Lovely touch.2. I go to a place like this about once a year, and a buddy in the wine business had just told me that when you taste wine in a restaurant, the only thing you are looking for is if it si corked - and you can easily smell that - no need to taste. The wine comes, I smell it, it fine. the server says,  excuse me sir, do you mind if I ask if you work in the businessOh yeah baby !! That me, at one with the beautfiul people. Having said that, when I try that stunt ack homethe server suggests that I should taste the wine.3. Oh yeah - the food. Marvellous. Magnificent. Worth it.Fabulous, life affirming, splendid.', 'Though I enjoyed the old look and feel, the new design pops. Beautiful surroundings, exceptional and flawless service, expansive wine list, and creatively scrumptious vegetarian tasting menu (six-course). The pairings were spot on. The chilled soup, squash ravioli and brussel sprouts were melt-in-your-mouth favourites. Delicious cheese. Very discreet and respectful of privacy; no gawkers or interruptions. But this is New York, after all...There are enough reviews here without being overly redundant about this must-do experience.', Okay I know I am going to get a lot of jeers for this but I have to be honest. I am even tempted to give it 1 1/2 stars. Maybe I expected too much? I came here with the notion that I would be dazzled and wowed with flavors beyond heaven... DEFINITELY NOT.I will tell you what you get. A rude server that will probably look down on you if you don't order that Oooh so important bottled water. They just look down their noses at you. Okay it's not like we are cheap, I just don't care for sparkling water! Blech! We ended up spending $200 per person, dude can't they be a little nicer and classier.Another thing I had a problem with was I was starving most of the night. The only thing that filled me up was all the bread! Yes, I paid $200 to eat bread! The portions were puny, as expected from a tasting menu but these were just extra extra tiny! Just thinking about this place makes me mad. Every time I see him on TV I jeer! Boo! I have also recently went to Daniel Baloud's Brasserie in Vegas. What a let down as well. Although I guess you can say it wasn't too much of a let down since I already knew what to expect. At least Vegas was a better deal, but the same blah-ness.He ranks lowest on my top NY chefs that's for sure. Word to the wise, go to Bouley's or Danube, Le Bernardin, Fleur de Sel, and the list can go on. Much better price/value too!, It was a 5-star experience from the instant you walk in. The decor, the service, the ambiance, the food. And it wasn't ridiculous at ~$100 prix fix 3 course. Had an awesome time people watching too. So upper east side ;) do we have anything like this in the bay area???, Restaurant Daniel = Enjoyable Classical French Dining ExperienceDon't come here for foams, sous-vide chicken, and fried mayo! If molecular gastronomy is your angle, then Daniel will seem conventional.Unlike its older predecessors La Grenouille, La Cote Basque, and Lutece, Daniel delivers a French experience without the pretentious French attitude. You come to Daniel for excellent service,a wonderful dining room, and delicious French food: arctic char baked in a salt-crust, roasted squab with foie gras and morel mushrooms, and whole oven-roasted pheasant stuffed with black truffles and Fall root vegetables. The restaurant used to be Le Cirque in the 80's. Daniel Boulud earned 4 stars as the chef of Le Cirque. So this restaurant has a bit of history. The crowd is mostly older Upper East side residents, world travelers, and bankers. The dress code is formal. The menu is very extensive offering several different tasting menus. I defintely recommend a tasting menu with wine pairings here. The wine list is amazing, of course. If you elect to go a la carte, then the check average will be $100-125 per person including a glass of wine, tax, and tip. I won't lie. The food is on another level when Daniel is personally cooking for you. He is a master chef that truly enjoys cooking for others. Still, Daniel is one of the few restaurants in the country that has managed to stay cool despite remaining French., A beautiful, if slightly stuffy, space with original, good food. Nothing will go wrong during your dinner at Daniel, the service is excellent. It's old-school, don't expect fusion anything.|2
17|eleven-madison-park-new-york|A gorgeous room, grand and light filled even on rainy New York winter days. Lovely service, and possibly the best prix fixe lunch in the entire city. The raw bar, the foie gras menu, all delightful and handled with care. I've been known to take a cab straight from the airport in order to lunch here. elevenmadisonpark.com, Danny Meyer works his magic once again at Eleven Madison Park. The dining room is vast and open with high ceilings. Although pricey the food is wonderful. Lots of menu options to chose from. It's located at Madison Park and which is a great place to walk off your dessert with a stroll around the park., It's a beautiful room: light, airy, high ceilings, lots of big flowers, and the food is excellent, though portions small. Service was pleasant and professional, but the bartender didn't know how to mix some classic cocktails. When the menus came we were unpleasantly surprised to find that the $25 prix fixe lunch that my friend confirmed a couple of weeks ago when she made the reservations was now $32. We still had a very pleasant lunch today but more expensive than we were led to believe. (I obviously won't put this on my list of prix fixe lunches for $25 and under!), I reallly like this place. We went for Brunch for my girlfriend's birthday and had a very nice meal. The space is beautiful and classy, like and old bank (it actually might be one). The food is well done classic American food and they ahve a great little breakfast cocktail bar for those of us who like a fruity beverage in the morning (not usually me but I did have a passion fruit Belini.) I had Poached eggs with Lobster and bearnaise on toast and you really can't have a better brunch than that. I would definitely go back. I wonder if it shares a kitchen with Tabla next door?, I had the loveliest lunch here. Everything was exquisite and service was stellar. The room was nicely arranged and has high ceilings, with fresh flowers everywhere. I had the veal and it just melted in the mouth. I could have sat there and ate every last piece they had in the kitchen, but then I'd probably have to wash dishes there for the rest of my life!, Daniel Humm is a rock star!! He's one of the best chefs we have ever encountered and things are only looking up, (he's just turned 30). As fans of Chef Humm when he was at Campton Place Hotel in San Francisco, we made a beeline to Eleven Madison Park when our plane landed in NYC. We were not disappointed. From the moment we sat down, our experience was sublime. Chef Humm sent out a long rectangular plate of 4 ea x 2 appetizers for our table. Raw tuna, sardine spring roll, cheese and apricot jam, oyster en gelee. All were fantastic!! Next up was another gratis amuse bouche, langoustine in an orange broth, which was amazing!! Our appetizers: Liz - Gnocchi of La Rappe Potatoes with lemon and sardine. Ron had Poached Organic Egg with Everglades Frog Legs, Oregon Chantrelles and Sauce. Both dishes were absolutely elegant in flavors and execution. And it only got better. Chef then sent out the main course Glazed California Muscovy Duck with Lavender Honey and Spices for 2. This main course we found is a two part presentation. After being brought out whole and shown to you, the duck breast sliced and presented with skin on!! Fantastic, ruins it for just about anyone else who makes duck. I can't imagine it being done any better!! After that comes a confit of duck leg which is super incredible too!!We then had dessert which consisted of a chocolate hazelnut souffle w/ gianuja ganache and espresso bean ice cream. Fantastic again. Liz had Sheeps Milk Yogurt Cheesecake with Roasted Pineapple, Kaffir Lime and Frozen Coconut. The pastry chef has been with Eleven Madison Park for about six years, did a fantastic job.After this wonderful meal, we were given a wonderful dessert to take home with us!! Service was outstanding, friendly and classy. The only thing we weren't nuts about was the room itself, with it's 2 story ceilings, it seemed a bit large. But a small complaint.Don't walk, run to the restaurant and have Chef Humm's food!!! The staff are well trained, there are enough food runners to get the food hot to your table and they let you linger if you like. It's a great place!!!!! See the recent 3 out of 4 stars review of this place in the NY Times. -Ron & Liz, i traveled all the way across the country to visit my chef and sommelier crushes. daniel humm and john regan did not disappoint.my dining partner wasn't drinking so i asked john for the wine by the glass that i would most like based on my all-time favorite wine. he picked out the perfect one, which shows he not only knows his wines but that their list of wines by the glass isn't lacking.as for the food, we were greeted with a complimentary tray of single savory bites, a tray for each of us. the rest of the meal was just me admiring what daniel can do with seafood, fruit, foams and vegetables. he's an awesome genius and i wish i could visit more., 'Here is another New York restaurant that goes way beyond 5 stars. I love Daniel Humm food. Looooove it. Sadly he is long gone from SF, but that just gave us the perfect chance to go to Eleven Madison Park. When we went in November we got the amazing tasting menu. Everything was absolutely incredible: the Fantasy of Eggs, The Turbot, The Lobster with Alba Truffles, The Partridge with foie and chestnuts, Foie with a sort of peanut butter jelly brioche combination, the Queue de veau, and then the gorgeous desserts (sadly by this point we had had two bottles of wine and countless other glasses...so i can remeber, but I DO remember being in awe and finishing every last bite. Perfect service on a very very busy night, perfect food, a Gorgeous dining room, and an outstanding wine list.', My first experience at 11 Madison was during Restaurant Week and I give it high, high marks. The food was fabulous, the waitstaff polite and kind, and the restaurant itself lovely.EMP offers 'American' food and is one of Danny Meyer's signature eateries. Its reputation is well-deserved, I think, though mostly out of my price range. This would be a good place to come if you're having a special night or entertaining out of town guests with a decent budget.I have read elsewhere that restaurants usually don't offer their best stuff during Restaurant Week because of the 'low' price. That may or may not be true. But if it is true for EMP, then I can't wait to go back and try their best. You know the feeling you get when you put food in your mouth that is so well done that it just makes you want to melt away in a happy puddle of goo? That was EMP for me. From the appetizer to the dessert I was not disappointed with anything I tasted. To top it off, everyone who dined there during the first week of RW got a gift certificate for $24.07 off their next meal. What a great way to draw people back! Especially people who don't have a lot of money. I'm going back just for the dessert., Friends and I ate here on 4/20/07 and had an uncompromisingly mediocre meal. After my stellar meal in December, I was absolutely crushed by the food, which fell short of expectation. The bread and service were still exemplary, but the meal itself lacked soul - flavor pairings were mismatched, temperature and texture were flat, and some ingredients were nothng short of a betrayal. Truffles in April? Please! Even the foie disappointed (although the foie creme brulee is quite lovely in texture, flavor, and warmth). Daniel Humm appears to have simplified the menu and the dishes he is serving. There's little ambition, it seems, in what he is doing now. Look for a new cheese cart in the coming weeks.Read the review below to get a perspective on what has changed, and why 11 MP only gets three of five stars from me now.First review, written in December 2006 - very different experience:(Note: then 29-year old Daniel Humm took over the kitchen at 11 Madison Park in 2006 - reviews written prior to early to winter 2006 apply to the cuisine of Kerry Heffernan)Daniel Humm is ambitious, very ambitious. Sometimes the word 'ambitious' is used in a perjorative way to describe food a restaurant. In this case I mean 'ambitious' in only the best way - Daniel Humm wants to be the best in New York in just a few short years, and judging from the meal we enjoyed last night he doesn't have too many years to wait. Honing his craft at San Francisco's Campton Place, Humm doesn't overintellectualize food - he uses great ingredients, prepares them well, and only tips his hat to a current molecular gastronomy craze with a few 'foams' (which add visual appeal but aren't that interesting anymore). Sauce seems to be his forte -- every single dish I ate was not only sauced impeccably but portioned appropriately, visually exciting, and absolutely delicious.The current menu starts at $76 dollars -- for three courses: two savory and one sweet. Actually, the kitchen sends out a number of amuse courses and mignardises, so we actually ended up with 6 courses counting everything sent to the table. For $88 you can order 3 savory courses and one sweet, and there is also a gourmand degustation menu for $125 , with wine pairings for another $85 (I think).We opted for a bottle -- a 2001 Montlouis from Louis/Dressner reasonably priced at $46 (yes, of course a 2-300% markup from retail, but that's most restaurants, right?) which was a great foil to the dishes we ordered: a gnocchi with hawaiian shrimp and truffles, a big eye tuna salad, one of the most silken chicken dishes I have ever eaten in my life, and, surprisingly, with tenderloin and marrow. Dessert was suitably glorious. I had a perfectly prepared chocolate fondant (you know, the now-cliched warm chocolate truffle/volcano cake) with a twist - it was served with passion fruit sorbet (not the twist) and a thin glass of the most heavenly passion fruit ambrosia - warm foam on top, icy, granita-style smoothly below. It was a most suitable and bright counterpoint to the rich, warm cake.The service was great-- attentive, thoughtful, and prompt. I will definitely be back. Daniel Humm is one to watch. He's really amazing -- and that's not hype., 'High ceilings, lots of space for you at the dining table (which seems to be getting rarer in this city) and perfect food without uptight servers.Come here for the tasting menu with the wine pairing to celebrate something special and plan on enjoying your meal for at least a few hours.The tasting menu we had (the Gormand) with a wine pairing for each course this winter:Hors deuvresFantasy of EggsSea Urchin, Knoll Krest Farm Egg and Sterling Royal CaviarHeirloom BeetsRoasted with Lynnhaven Chevre Frais, and Olio VerdeNantucket Bay ScallopsCeviche with Citrus and TarragonElevages Perigord Foie GrasTorchon with Venezuelan Cocoa and QuinceLoup de MerSeared with Fennel Confit, Candied Taggiasca Olives and Sauce ViergeNova Scotia LobsterVeloute with Curry and LemongrassFour Story Hill PoulardePiquee aux Truffles Noires and La Ratte Potato MousselineSnake River Farm Short-RibsBraised with Porcini MushroomsFourme dmbertPear-Vanilla Mousseline, Port-Wine Reduction and Candied PecansSatsuma TangerineCappucino with Blood Orange and Star AniseAraguani ChocolateSouffle with Candied Popcorn and Salted Caramel Ice CreamMignardisesMake dinner reservations in advance, Bruni just gave it three stars so people are probably going to be all over this.', 'So so soooo good. If you go all out with appetizers, entrees, and desserts, youl be thankful the portion sizes are small -- theye just the right amount to let you taste and savor everything without stuffing yourself silly (although that happened to me anyway).I came here on a weekend afternoon when they were serving the brunch menu, but we opted to skip that and go straight for the regular menu. Everything was amazing -- even the bread basket, which had gigantic croissants, mini chocolate croissants, and whole wheat bread from Balthazar was stellar. The foie gras with quince and cocoa on top of homemade brioche bread was a great appetizer. Definitely get the big eye tuna with pickled asian pear and celery appetizer -- my personal favorite, with it tasting so refreshing and cool in comparison to the other dishes.I got the poached poularde, which was DELICIOUS, but after having a taste of everyone else entrees, I say I was most impressed by the black angus beef tenderloin -- practically melted in my mouth. Dessert was a little less memorable but by no means less delicious -- I got the chocolate moelleux, which came with a shot of passion fruit bourbon sour (I think it was mixed with passion fruit sorbet?). Nice nice nice. Great service as well.', 'Fantastic - particularly now with the new chef in place. Do the tasting menu but be prepared to shell out a whole lot of cash, drink a lot of expensive wine and let your belt out at least a notch.', I am a big Daniel Humm fan--I used to go to Campton Place each trip to SF. I find 11 Madison to be great. The food is innovative as always with Daniel Humm. The wine selection was excellent and the price is not outrageous for NYC. I though the main course was designed especially well to go with good wine. Also, the restaurant is well designed given that it is in a former bank (I assume). One of the best restaurants in NYC--SF's loss is NYC's gain. The Yankees would be lucky to do as well., 'I did not have the pleasure to do the tasting menu, instead did the 3 course meal. Appetisers were amazing. Explosive in flavor. Beautifully presented where I resisted the urge to flash out my camera phone and get all touristy on the restaurant and take pictures of the plates, Yes, My name is Bianca Lam and I take pictures of my food. Entree- eeeh.. Was not particularly impressed with it. Then again, I got the beef of some sort and my date got the deer meet. so.. they did taste relatively similar. The appetizors unfortunately got me all pumped up that my inner tourst was waiting for an extravagant, beautifully set dish, but yet was sadly dissapointed. Dessert - Oooh..... Mouth Heaven.... Try the hot chocolate. you will not be sorry, I PRomise you. DUDE man it can even compete with Rive Gauche!! I swear!! ^_^ Even the presentation was beautiful. for both dishes were beutifully set.ooh I get it Daniel Humm you purposey do that aye? Give me a Fabulous Boom and then..leave me wanting for more and then BAM! MOUTH HEAVEN BABY!!!I like your style ^_~ *wink *wink*Service was fabulous. I give them 5 out of 5. Attentive, polite, and very smooth with the moves. They even send a Brioche with you as you leave the restaurant, which btw is very tasty with espresso.Go there ^_^ I can only imagine the tasting menu is far more superior than the 3 course.', 'Oh god is all I can say. I would never be able to eat here if it had not been for our company party. The wine was absolutely fantastic, and every dish was unique and extremely tasty. I especially liked the lamb and the salmon dishes, although there was too much wine going around to remember everything on the side :) The cheese offerings for desert were also great, but again, the focus here for that night was on the wine. Just fantastic. I will return when my wallet allows. Definitely recommended if you can get a table.', 'This place is phenomenal. It can be a little intimidating but just enjoy your meal. I had the Mi-Cuit salmon and it was amazing. Definitely expensive but worth every penny.', John Travolta managed to recover from a decade of bad hair and polyester. Teri Hatcher caught her second wind and is no longer doing Radio Shack commercials. And Daniel Humm has rescued Eleven Madison Park from mediocrity.First let's start with the 3 course menu ($86, I think) which included a free 3 part amuse bouche (incredible) and another free appetizer later as well as a sizeable brioche cake to take home. (Never understood that... like I really needed that big fat cake to wash down that 5 part meal the next morning. But a nice gesture, don't get me wrong) The foie gras appetizer (oh yes, I'm still running that one off at the gym) was heavenly and rich and the pork confit... Never has a pig product been so deliciously fattening, crispy and delicate at the same time. So my conclusion. Go. If your memories of Eleven M.P. are from the Pre-Humm days, you need to go and appreciate the new and improved version. After all, everyone (well, except perhaps, for a few ex-boyfriends) deserves a second chance., 'I picked Eleven Madison Park for brunch because I heard good things about their menu and the great view of the park you get from sitting on the second floor (plus, who remembers the Sex and the City scene with Carrie and Big?!) I requested the second floor since I thought it would be nice to have a good view and when we arrived at the restaurant, we walked up TWO steps to the second floor and we could barely see Madison Square Park. Oh well. The brunch menu is pretty limited but I ordered the pecan praline pancakes with brown butter bananas and rum raisins (wow that a mouthful!).The bananas were really delicious (I guess anything with butter tastes good, right?) and the pancakes were very moist, although not as moist at the Clinton St. Baking Company. The rum raisins were too chewy, although, I not a big fan of raisins to begin with. My date ordered the steel cut oats with Devon Cream Cinnamon Toast and Cider Roasted Apples. My mom asked the hostess what steel cut oats were and since she didn know, she went onto a computer and wikipedia-ed it. Isn that nice of her? The oats were very thick and stick-to-your-stomach good. My mom ordered the Organic Egg Frittata with Mushrooms, Zucchini and Gruyre, which I ate most of (oops!).The egg frittata was a little runny, but not too runny, which I think is a great way to eat eggs. The mushrooms and all of the other vegetables were from the nearby farmers market as well, which is a nice way to support small businesses. Overall, I think the brunch at Eleven Madison Park is good, but there was practically no one there when we arrived and the setting was more business-like than brunch-like. If you want to see pictures from my brunch at Eleven Madison Park, check out my website: gracenotesnyc.com. Happy eating!', I had a lunch date with my mom and our friend for Restaurant Week at Eleven Madison Park. After our lovely experience at Tabla, which is on the other end of the street, I had high expectations. I wish I could say they were all met.Granted, I realize the RW menu is probably not going to be as high caliber as the regular menu, but I have eaten at other participating restaurants where the food off the prix-fixe menu has been knock-your-socks off good. Don't get me wrong, the food was good but it didn't have me begging for more. The best thing I had was the strawberry gazpacho appetizer. It was delicious, light and not overly sweet. My main course was gnocchi, which had a nice flavor but a week later, I couldn't really tell you what the flavor was. I was disappointed with my dessert, which was a sort of fruit tart (apricot, I think) with almond honey ice cream. The ice cream was good but the tart was way too tart for me to enjoy it. Unfortunately, I had to run back to the office so I didn't get a chance to try anyone else's food - I was especially wanting to try the panna cotta since it looked so appetizing.The service, for the most part, was good. The hostesses were especially friendly and welcoming. Our waitress, on the other hand, was totally phoning it in. Now, I realize that most wait staff hate RW b/c they lose out on a lot of tips, and I understand that. But if you already know that you're getting less tip off the bat, why are you gonna shoot yourself in the foot by having an attitude and acting so blase, thus earning even less of a tip? I took heart in the fact that it wasn't just us - I saw how she treated the women at the next table who also came for RW. She wasn't outright rude or anything, she just didn't seem like she cared or wanted to be there. I'm sorry, but you're in the service industry. Some service would be nice.With so many other great restaurants in the city, it's hard for me to say that I'd be willing to come back and give Eleven Madison Park another go. From the other reviews, the non-RW dining experience sounds excellent. Maybe some day, I'll find out for myself., 'We dined at 11 Madison Park this past Saturday. In every respect, was one of the better dining experiences in memory. Food was exceptional and service was excellent. All in all, anyone seeking a special occassionion restaurant in NYC area would not be disapointed by this place!', I came here beginning of the year-so cannot describe this place to the fullest extent. Sure I had to wait a few minutes before I got my reserved table here---I STILL WOULD GO BACK!Me love this place----so freaking good!I seriously ate EVERYTHING-Tuna tartare, gnocchi, and my passion fruit sorbet with vanilla cake decorated in a flute!I even manage to finish my co-workers Chocolate dessert. (I know I am such a pig!) I don't even like CHOCOLATE, but this place made it so tasty that even I liked it!I cannot wait to go back!, 'If you know and enjoy good food do the right thing: go here, plan a 3 hour meal and have the tasting menu with the wine pairing. The food is absolutely astounding and the wine pairing is equally amazing. I followed Daniel Humm here from San Francisco where he was at Campton Place (which was badly hurt since Daniel took two sous chefs and the sommelier with him). Been to the restaurant a few times now and its been wonderful each time. Although I must admit that the last time I went here (end of August) the food was slightly weaker than Ie had in past. Not worse than normal, just not as mind-blowingly innovative and scrumptious like every other time Ie eaten Daniel food. One other thing is that I liked it better when there was more than one tasting menu option. He used get creative and sometimes vary the dish for a course just to shake things up a bit when there was a larger group-- for example, the course would be foie gras and one person would have it served in a pot de creme, another person would have it seared. I think that all disappeared because Eleven Madison is much bigger and they needed a way to maintain a solid menu. He used to prepare some of his food sous vide (way of slow cooking food at a low temp in special vacuum bags) which made his food so tender and delicious, but I think that DOH in NYC may of banned that (not sure). Daniel even comes out to the floor and says hi when he there. I remember when I first had his food in SF he could barely speak any English (he Swiss) and when you would compliment him on his wonderful food he would only smile, nod and say, Ahh Dank Cooo, Dank Coo (thank you). In addition the wine list is great and the wine pairing is always stellar. The sommelier really knows what he doing and when he serves sauterne with fois gras, or pinot noir with fish he isn doing it because it novel, but because it a damn good pairing. Ie personally learned a lot of wonderful new ways to pair wine and food together as well as discovered great wines as a result of eating here-- and I honestly can say that about any other restaurant off the top of my head. In all, it is incredible. Youl even get a little treat when you leave the restaurant. Used to be madelines in SF, now it a huge brioche.', OUTSTANDING!!! Your tastebuds will write you love letters. And normally I don't give a flying flip off a balcony what the place looks like as long as it caters to the taste buds, but DAMN GINA, this place is pimped. The high ceilings are spectacular as are the views. And the food, oh the food. Did I mention the food? Impeccable service, relaxing atmosphere, mouthwatering goodies. This is what New York dining is all about my friends. Just enjoy the ramen you will be eating the week leading up to your reservation you should most definitely make one because this place ain't cheap. But as far as this place is concerned, you definitely get what you pay for. FAN-FUCKING-TASTIC!, 'This is one of the best places I have eaten in Manhattan. I love love love the food, service, and experience... I think that this is one of the best dining experiences i have had in my life. The space is beautiful, with a daytime view of madison square park, and the ambiance is spectacular. Bring your favorite person here.', 'Simply OUTSTANDING.Thank you, Eleven Madison Park. Thank you for being the highlight of my recent trip to New York City.Thank you for reminding me that while it IS all about the food, it takes more than just Michelin stars and stuffy atmospheres. Thank you for showing me that a truly memorable dinner experience takes ambiance, service, and a dose of friendliness and humor. Service - absolutely top-notch. All staff are attentive, but almost as importantly, approachable, hip, and friendly, willing to answer any newbie questions you might have. They were also knowledgeable about the menu and happy to explain even the most minute details. Hats off to the waiters especially.  Ambiance - wonderful, open air space accentuated most prominently by high ceilings and tasteful decor. I was told several times by friends that the place had been featured in an important Sex and the City episode (whatever that means). But what I liked most about the ambiance was that it was completely comfortable and relaxing. Never once did I feel the need to talk too quietly or even act differently than I would at my favorite casual chow spot. Truly welcoming of both the touristy shutterbug (that would be me; see photos) and the sophisticated New Yorker. That an accomplishment. Food - After perusing the menu, we decided to go all out and try the Gourmand menu ($145/person). It was a true feast. Over nine courses that took almost 4 hours. Among the many highlights:* Royal Sterling Caviar w/ Smoked River Sturgeon - absolutely fantastic dish. Enough said.* Vichyssoise - an amazing combination of leeks, potatoes, and truffles topped w/ a quail egg* Vermont Suckling Pig - their signature dish. I coulde eaten twice as much as served.* Fromage of Cheese - I not a cheese fan at all. But the presentation of the cheese cart, wonderful cheese descriptions, and the incredibly bold and contrasting flavors of the cheese, almonds, and figs impressed even me.  the details - Perhaps related to service and ambiance, but clearly deserving of its own category here. Eleven Madison Park has got all the details right. Seemingly effortless, I have no doubt it takes tons of work. From describing each California-based item for us (once they discovered we were from SF) to bringing hot water for my girlfriend cold hands every 30 minutes to providing a custom copy of the menu to having our coats ready when we left to chit-chatting about the benefits of Maldon salt (this was our water boy)...I could go on and on. It was impressive. Ie heard they test their staff daily and that attention to detail and commitment to excellence shows.Once again, thank you, Eleven Madison Park. May others visit you and have as good a time as we did. And may everyone enjoy the photos I took as a touristy shutterbug. :)', This may even deserve 5 stars. This place is exceptional. The dining room is beautiful and grand and big. The service is amazing (as are all Danny Meyer restaurants) and the food is very tasty. I won't give it 5 stars because it's pricey. But, it's a great place to go. I have been wanting to try this place forever. I went with 3 girlfriends. It's the perfect place to go for an upscale girl outing. I had the tuna appetizer (very well done and beautifully presented) and the venison with tagliatelle. Very innovative on how it was served (pasta was on the side and you mix it in). The desserts were great too. The portions aren't enormous. This is a place to taste the quality of the food, not to chow down, hence, not my particular type of place. However, I still was able to appreciate the full dining experience. Would I go back? Probably not, but would I recommend the place to others? Absolutely!, I came in with HUGE expectations because of all the hype this place receives on Chowhound, but I have to say I was slightly dissapointed. We started off with the foie gras, which was amazing, and the hamachi tartare which I felt was a little too fishy for my liking. Then my red snapper was a little dry, but the bone marrow crusted tenderloin my date got was pretty amazing. The dessert's were just average as well. To be fair, I did go for lunch and I feel that you do sometimes get shortchanged, but after so many rave reviews I was expecting a bit more. Don't get me wrong, it was still a wonderful experience, but I probablly won't be rushing to go back anytime soon., Phenomenal service, exquisite decor, and amazing ingredients lent themselves to a wonderfully memorable meal. I wanted to give this place five stars, but unfortunately the executed dishes lacked when compared to some of the terribly indulgent meals I've had recently.Nonetheless, Eleven Madison Park didn't disappoint. We sampled the Nova Scotia lobster roll (the lobster meat was succulent and tender, but somewhat overpowered by the amount of avocado. this is fine dining, not a corner sushi joint), the loup de mer (delicately flavored and cooked almost to perfection, though I'm glad we had this as an appetizer and not an entree), the suckling pig (the NY Times' description of this dish in particular intrigued me beyond words. it was indeed a delicious explosion of flavors, but not a transcendental one), and the duck (very, incredibly, extremely delicious. beyond my expectations. crispy skin tinged with crusted lavender and spices, tender meat that falls apart in your slack jaws that are almost too awed by the taste to chew), chocolate caramel tart (pretty good, but not worth ordering again), and passionfruit souffle (unique, delicious, and well-executed).If you're going for the prixe fixe menu (as opposed to the Gourmand) I urge you to order the duck. However, the duck is only for two, which is somewhat of a problem if you want to try the other entrees. We opted to swap the suckling pig in as an appetizer for an extra 15$, which was well worth it.Service, as noted above, was incredible. We felt well-taken care of and comfortable enough to ask stupid questions.Dress code is on the nice side, but I saw plenty of people wearing jeans and sweaters on a weekend evening. Just stay in dress shoes and out of t-shirts and you should be fine., So.... foregoing the other 36 reviews. This place is stunningly perfect for a date with a truly special person in your life. Shiny, chic, warm, vaulting yet cozy, and most importantly... delicious. I was dateless (for a business meeting) which is a crime against over-the-top free meals, lol. Fortunately by the time I left I was madly in love with my entree and a bottle of 01 Barolo. I'm going back., 'I am the first to admit how shamelessly CHEAP I am when it comes to shelling out 5* reviews! I know I have no reason to be stingy cuz it not like it costing me anything but I feel I would be failing my YELP DUTIES if I was being too lenient and easy on establishments Ie patronized. I know people in the YELP community rely on my reviews to determine whether or not a an establishment is worth trying cuz this is what I rely on YELP for along with entertainment!I am sorry to digress from my review of EMP. I came here for brunch with a friend and made the rez via Opentable. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by very pleasant host who took our coats. We were walked to a table for two that was not the usual tiny and cramped table. The decor is very classy with tons of beautiful flower arrangements. It is a very spacious restaurant with very high ceilings and so it feels somewhat chilly in there but nevertheless, the decor was very tasteful without looking gaudy and stuffy.We had a few different servers and all were extremely polite and friendly without seeming fake or snooty. The service we were provided was excellent and far outbeats most if not all of the other high end restaurants I have been to. My friend had dropped her napkin when she got up to go to the restroom and it was immediately replaced with a fresh one! Now how much more attentition could you ask for?!My friend ordered an egg-cheese omelette and I ordered their Banana-pecan buttermilk pancakes. Both were very divine and my pancake was not overly sweet but just right. The dessert we shared was the Mango parfait which was quite nice without being too sweet. My friend who rarely goes out to brunch because she thinks it a rip off was very impressed and admitted she come back here for brunch! I am most definitely coming back here to try EMP prix-fixe menu for dinner and will most likely return for brunch.', The Bottom Line:This is quite possibly the best meal we've ever had in New York.We've been living in New York for 4 years, eating out frequently (and often trying nice restaurants such as this one). We like gourmet places with thoughtful menus and seasonal ingredients, that aren't too stuffy.If we weren't moving out of town soon we would come back as regularly as we could afford.Details:We ordered the 3-course prix fixe (appetizer, entree, dessert), and considering that the portions were reasonable and we got three amuse bouches (one of delicious small appetizers, one seasonal soup, and one set of little desserts), it was PLENTY of food.Everything we tried was delicious, the flavors well balanced, the ingredients seasonal and complementary. Each dish was prepared in a way that allowed the quality ingredients to present themselves, without overseasoning or saucing. The classic roasted beet and goat cheese salad was beautifully presented and perhaps the best incarnation of its kind. Lobster with chestnut pasta was divine, and worth the $20 supplement.The sommelier knew his stuff and made excellent recommendations. Their cocktail menu is also a treat, with a number of modern twists on old-fashioned drinks that have become trendy of late.The service was impeccable, though I would say a touch too much at times. On my way to the restroom I felt like I had to nod and smile at about 15 different staffers. But everyone was friendly and extremely attentive, and we never lacked water in our glasses or information about what we were eating.They were also, of course, very accommodating of my vegetarian dining mate. We had not alerted them to this prior to arrival, and so they even brought a second round of vegetarian amuse bouches for her since only one of the original set was vegetarian!The decor and ambience was excellent - a very open space, a combination of modern and classic. More than just fancy, it exuded class.If you come for dinner, I can't imagine how you would be disappointed., 'When I first entered Eleven Madison Park (EMP) I knew I was in for a treat. The dinning room oozed elegance and the wait staff attentively took our jackets as soon as we walked into the door. Not a moment later we were brought to our table of four, two chairs and a long booth. The wait staff pulled the table away from the booth to allow two of us to sit down, then gently secured the table back to it original location before the other two in my party were shown their seats. I could not believe the detail that went into just sitting us at our table.We ordered wine and cocktails, informed the waiter that one of our party was a vegetarian, and we were off. The waiter soon returned with our wine decanted and an assortment of starters. These ranged from tuna tar tar sandwiched between two pieces of parsnips to a wonton filled with a piece of sweetbreads. All five amuse bouches were very tantalizing and made me want my meal to come!Once those was finished our appetizers arrived. I ordered the Big Eye Tuna, which was marinated with fuju persiommons and pickled radishes. This was delicious and just enough different from standard tuna tar tar that it really stood out. The rest of the table ordered two other appetizers. The Heirloom Beets, which are roasted with olio verdw, aceto balsamico and lynnhaven Chevre Frais was very good. The pungent chevre frais was a perfect commplement to the beets. The Cape Code Bay Crap, which was a roulade with avocado, lime and yogurt, was probably the weakest appitizer, but overall very delicious.In between our appetizer and our main course arrived a soup sent by the chef. This soup was a cream sauce which included parsnips, pears and prawns with a mushroom foam. Our vegetarian was given the same soups san the prawns. It was very tasty, and one of my first dishes I ever have gotten that came with foam. I was very excited as was one of the guests who just loves foam.For my main dish, I got the Dry Aged Black Angus Beef, which was seared with bone marrow, swiss chard and souce bordelaise. The waiter asked if medium was okay, which for a moment shocked me, but I requested medium rare and everything was fine. Other main courses that were at our table was the Millbrook Farm Venison, which came with herb roasted wild mushrooms and crispy bacon. The venison also came with another cream soup on the side, this time it consisted of pulled venison shoulder, foie gras and more of that mushroom foam. The Mediterranean Loup de Mer, which came with satsuma tangerine, forence fennel and tarragon was very flaky and delicious. And for our vegetarian, the chef made a special mushroom lasagna with a chestnut pasta. I thought this was amazing, doublely so since it wasn on the menu.As for the dessert, I went with the Winter Citrus, which is a parfait with tarragon and black olive caramel. It was interesting and very out-of-the-box. I thought it was very well done, but for me the flavor was just missing the mark. The other dessert that came was the Bittersweet Chocolate, which was a pastilla with orange-guaijilo confit. I thought that this was pretty tasty, but terribly overwhelming in the chocolate department. I have never been a fan of chocolate.Lastly, another round of amuse bouches to close out the night. These were five pastry inspired dishs. They ranged from a standard puff pastry with vanilla cream to an olive oil gelee coated in a fine sugar. I thought it was a great way to close off an unforgettable experience at Eleven Madison Park.I would definitely return there again. However, the entry price is steep, everything was well worth the cost!', 'Best restaurant in NYC! Although a bit cold in the romantic corner of the room, the food is pristine! Very creative molecular gastronomy executions. Great muses, wine, and dessert.Danny Meyer does it right with his service-oriented restaurants.', We kicked off Restaurant Week in style. This was my first trip to Eleven Madison Park and I was very impressed with the decor. It's a very cool, modern, lofty space. We came for lunch since that was all they were offering. Upon first glance, I wasn't all that impressed with the choices on the RW menu but my disappointment was quickly dispelled once the food arrived. I decided on the poached egg appetizer with mushrooms in some kind of tomato-ey foam. It was quite good. For my main, I had the Boudin Blanc, which is their homemade sausage made from chicken and pork. It was served with pureed potatoes and cioppolini onions. This was also very tasty. The one dish which blew me away was the fiance's saffron risotto. It was cooked perfectly and was deliciously creamy. But what made it so good was the crushed amaretto cookies that were sprinkled over the top. I admit, i thought it sounded a bit strange at first but the flavor combination was out of this world. I highly recommend it. It's more of a side dish though (IMO). Everything was presented nicely and the service was top notch. I'd definitely like to come back for dinner or brunch., WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT? I've read countless reviews on how the chef is a genius. Genius he may be but with a high-priced pre-fix menu and portions that were fit for a toddler, I left 11 Madison highly disappointed. $350 lighter (on a dinner for two), I had 2 rounds of drinks, 2 ports, the lobster pre-fix and veal pre-fix. The lobster was very good but tiny; the whole portion fit into a baby's palm and if you don't believe me, you should check out the restaurant yourself. The veal entree was no bigger with a veal portion that was about 1 inch in diameter accompanied by sweet bread about the same diameter. Overall, if you have money to burn, I would go. if you know something about food nobody else does, you should go. If you have a slightly sophisticated palette yet have an appetite greater than that of a 5 year old, I would choose a more solid, traditional favorite., 'Danny done did it! Danny Meyer definitely knows what up. This place is DECENT (and I don mean decent as in so-so, I mean DECENT as in GOOD - notice the capitalization). The service is excellent and very well orchestrated. As someone who used to work the night shift at a 24-hour small town diner, I was very impressed. A far cry from how we used to haphazardly serve up chicken fingers and jalapeno poppers to the sloppy drunkards that frequented that place. Atmosphere is also very nice - modern and very spacious considering that theyl charge you $1000/month to rent out a closet in this city. The food is top-of-the-line. You really can go wrong with the menu there. They also bring out a bunch of freebies: hors deuvres, soup, second desserts, etc. Even unlimited bread - GOOD bread. Now for the drawbacks. First of all, it expensive. You already knew that. If youe loaded, don worry about it. But I deal in SUBPRIME mortgages (OUCH!) so it put a solid dent in my already thin wallet. $82 for 3 courses, $96 for 4 courses, and expect to pay up for drinks as well. My recommendation however is to GET THE FOUR COURSE MEAL. The portions are TINY! Even with the freebies, youe not going to stuff yourself. But get over it, cheese hog, you don need those extra pounds anyway. Get the four courser and youl go home satisfied but not stuffed. So, overall, great food and excellent service, but you might end up as a subprimer when you can pay your mortgage after EMP hits you up for $300 or so.', Divine! That encapsulates my entire experience at Eleven Madison Park. As soon as you step into the restaurant, you are greeted like a member of the family. The staff takes care of you every step of the way, ensuring that you have a wonderful experience- and that is exactly what it is: an experience. Eating here is not just about the food, but also the atmosphere and the interactions.It may seem at first as if you do not get much food with the prix-fixe menu. I ordered the gnocchi with shrimp for the appetizer and then the black Angus beef medallions for my entree. Before I received my appetizer, I was offered a medley of hors d'oeuvres and a bread plate. Next I was served a soup course of mushrooms with heavy cream, topped with a hazelnut foam. If I could have licked the cup without seeming gauche, I would have!It was after these three courses that I received my gnocchi, which practically melted in my mouth. And the beef was perfectly tender and perfectly cooked. Dessert was the chocolate with caramel concoction topped with chocolate ice cream. Their pastry chef is brilliant! After clearing the plates, we were offered mini pastries- as many as we would like. I felt like I could have asked to keep the whole plate and they would have allowed it! I really recommend the raspberry meringue cookie with chocolate filling.Throughout the meal, we had people checking on us to make sure everything was to expectations. The head chef and the pastry chef both stopped by our table to chat about the food. My water glass was never more than half empty. I truly felt cared for without feeling overwhelmed by attention. The whole experience was quite memorable and lovely., 'We New Yorkers truly can say we have seen the best of the best. All of the top businesses that drive the upper end of their market all have that special something that others are trying to copy. Eleven Madison may not have written the fine dining handbook but they certainly have followed it to the top.The space is beautiful: large open room with a fine bar to one side. The design is simple modern with a wood accented comfort. All of the fixtures from table settings to linens made me feel like I was in a special place.The menu is a bit different compared to most restaurants. They have two types of tastings: a three or four course limited and the full chef tasting. You will spend at least a hundred dollars a person here unless you sit at the bar. Is it worth it? Well, the food was the right portion size, fresh, seasoned well, presented beautifully, hot and timed perfectly, even if you stepped out for a smoke or use the facilities. The meal was an excellent example of fine dining. So what does that say about Eleven Madison? You should try it once. See a great dining program executed at a very high level. The food and drink, all on par with expectations. I couldn try all of the food on one visit but from what I saw and ate, I think any one will find something to rave about.An average value for your dollar and I should add for at least a hundred dollars but I think you get your monies worth from a night out at Eleven Madison across from Madison Square.', 'Just went today for brunch and it was excellent. I went with a group of friends, along with my husband. The service was top notch, and the presentation was beautiful. When you walk in, you are greeted by a small area, which today had a variety of floral arrangements, it was gorgeous. Also, the place was not stuffy in the least. The room is open so you have a chance to look all around the place. The meal was superb--I had salmon as an entree but we all split several appetizers, including the pecan pancakes, fruit platter, bread basket, and I tried my friends beet salad and fritatta. I highly recommend this place as do I with other Danny Meyer restaurants, which include blue smoke, USC, and the modern. High class, excellent service, worth every penny.', Service - well-trained and attentive if perhaps not genuine...Food - good if you like to go home hungry. I want to know if Daniel Humm, chef and creator of the high-end food here, has EVER HEARD OF A VEGETABLE. (sorry...) It's lovely how they provide so many little amuse bouche dishes and such, but it's all fluff. Real attention to detail is WARM ROLLS not mediocre bread that's sitting out on the server caddy all night.Prices - high, as expected. Not only will you leave hungry, you will leave much closer to broke. P.S. The Nova Scotia lobster is more like a tiger shrimp. And like I said, nothing comes with veggies or starch, so make sure you're ready to have one shrimp for dinner for $80. Have fun!, Some years ago, I dined at Eleven Madison Park with some co-workers to celebrate the completion of a major project. I was so blown away by the food and the service, I promised myself I would come back to such a fabulous establishment.Well ladies and gents, I finally kept that promise. I brought my sister with me to try this top notch dining experience. Although there are three and four course meals available, you can really request any number of courses from the menu. We thought about going for five or six courses, but honestly, for the amount of money, we chose the eleven course gourmand menu! To top that off, we went for the wine pairings with each dish. The food was pretty amazing and on occasion, challenging to the palate. Fantasy of Eggs, which was sea urchin, caviar and a slow poached egg served in the shell, turned out very savory and delicious, and I can't stand urchin! Foie gras served with pineapple and pearl onions had a definite tang, and the frog's legs served lasagna Forestiere and so tender and flavorful, I wish I could've asked for seconds! Lobster, scallops, squab, beets, cheese and two dessert courses made for a very sumptuous meal.The wine pairings were also astounding. I'm not a wine connoisseur but my sister certainly has a taste for it. Claude Genet champagne, Kura No Hana daiginjo sake, Jacques-Frederic Mugnier Burgundy, Cavallari Bolgheri Superiore - it was really fascinating. In fact, they even opened up a fresh bottle of the burgundy (or was it the Tuscan wine) just for us! The service was impeccable and the wait staff very friendly and willing to chat about the meal or the chosen wines. Their attention really heightened the whole experience for us. The feeling was definitely mutual, as our head wait person told us that the staff has a great time with people looking to explore and engage in the food and wine the restaurant has to offer.I can't say enough about how wonderful a time my sister and I both had at Eleven Madison Park. Anyone who has any interest in trying high-end gourmet food and service in New York should definitely dine here., So far, one of my top favorite NYC restaurants and the epitome of what a dining experience should be - down to the food, the service, the room and the ambiance! My first time was brunch - oh the blood orange mimosa was perfect with the banana french toast (no longer on the brunch menu...sad). I forget what else accompanied my meal but i do remember my friend's eggs benedict. Something so simple, yes I know, but hot damn!! those eggs!!Dinner the next time around was one for the books! The kona kampachi was beautifully presented so beautiful I almost felt bad eating it, but once I did it was a pleasure. The grapefruit slices on top was the perfect addition of acidity and the hearts of palm gave it a sublime multi-textured effect. Perfect. Next out was the Black Angus Beef tenderloins with swiss chard and bordelaise sauce...it was rich but not overly so. This could very well be the best beef dish I've had (I'm planning to order this again on my next visit...yes, that good). My friend had the venison which was spot-on for a cold night. For dessert I had the coconut panna cotta with mango. I'm not a big fan of coconut (due to texture) but I do love the flavor and our waiter assured me that it would be smooth. In this creamy goodness the marriage of coconut and mango is harmonious and its not too decadent (meaning you can eat the whole thing and not feel sick to your stomach).Not only was our meal amazing but the impeccable service and stunning room will make this a memorable dining experience. Thank you Eleven Madison Park, and well done., 'I went here to celebrate my college graduation and had the gourmand tasting menu. The experience was incredible. The service was top-notch, attentive but not in your face. The food was extremely inspired and also left you feeling satisfied at the end of the meal. They presented us with a copy of the menu since they knew we were celebrating a special occasion. As an avid foodie and food nerd, when chef Daniel Humm came by to ALL of the tables to ask how our meal was I was floored! He even obliged my request for a photo.I highly, highly recommend EMP for your next celebration.', 'People that know me know that I don mess around when it comes to my food and my drink. I don presume to tell others what to like, and I don waste time trying to perpetuate hype where none is merited. Likewise, I refuse to let trends and taste-makers dictate what it is that makes me tick, and I have little patience for style insofar as it stands as an obstacle to substance. If the substance is there already then fine, layer on all the style you feel is appropriate. But I make no allowance for the zeitgeist to mash it grubby, sticky hands all over the things that I hold near and dear.So it was with no small measure of trepidation that I walked through the big glass door at the entrance of Eleven Madison Park, where Chef Daniel Humm has been wowing the wine-and-food geek crowd since it opening a couple of years back. Seems to me that it always so hit-or-miss with the hot-spot thing, but I guess I felt that enough of a consensus had emerged to preclude any grand disappointment. But still... I am thrilled to report that words cannot describe how misplaced my apprehension was. You may take it on my good authority that 11 Mad is the goods, from top to bottom.It a bright, open and airy environment, with tall ceilings and lots of natural light. The service is welcoming and enthusiastic without being showy. The wine pairings were smart and relatively economical. And the food.... good heavens, the food...Halibut cooked mi cuit (a sort of sous-vide) with champagne sauce, cauliflower florets and a quenelle of black trumpet mushroom. Seared foie gras with rhubarb and crumbled Breton cookie (the best foie Ie ever had). Pan roasted wild pheasant with veal jus and toasted faro. A souffle of Vermont Quark cheese with green apple sorbet. A delightful pot of chamomile tea. Everything I ate, everything I drank was simply spot-on. The progression of courses was conceptually correct to my mind and palate. The fish, the quail, the foie all seemed of impeccable provenance and were cooked so perfectly, so accurately.And when I asked the waiter if he might be able to tell me how the rhubarb was prepared for the foie presentation, one of the chefs appeared from the kitchen to give me a mini-tutorial on the painstaking process. I could tell he needed to get back to his station but nonetheless was exceedingly patient with my questions about the minutiae and was very gracious about taking the extra time to make sure I understood the ins-and-outs of it.Prices were high, as one would expect, on the grand scale. A 5-course lunch with wine-pairings ran about a hundred bucks, which is not cheap, I willingly concede. But considering the level of service, and the precision and thoughtfulness of the cuisine, it seemed a not-unfair price to pay. I cannot foresee a future in which a trip to NYC does not include a stop to 11 Mad. I make no claims to taste-maker status, but if consulted I would not hesitate to add my voice to the chorus that would steer you, enthusiastically, to the little ramekin of heaven that is Eleven Madison Park.', 'After a morning trip through MoMA, we took the subway down to Madison Square park to our late lunch reservations at Eleven Madison. We, being on vacation, had to plan to bring some usinessclothes so we can fit in for this reservation. We weren too sure how strict they were with their dress code, but wanted to at least somewhat fit in. We got there a tad bit late, and were immediately seated. How fitting to have just came from MoMA, because everything here looked so modern. We decided to order a few drinks (a dirty martini for me and light wine for her) and order their Gourmand Menu. First up, we had the Maine diver scallops served on an almond panna cotta with muscat grapes. First thing you notice is how beautiful the dish looked. Absolutely stunning. The scallops were perfectly cooked but the entire dish with the almond, the grapes, and the scallops had a taste that I wasn used to, but definitely something I would try again. The next dish was a Wild Atlantic Halibut slightly cooked, served with cauliflower and black trumpet mushrooms (truffle flavors) in a champagne emulsion. This was a great plate. Everything looked beautiful and tasted as it looks. Now we had the Foie Gras served with rhubarb, and a meyer lemon cookie crumble. Perfectly cooked foie gras the texture went great with the cookie, can remember what I thought about the rhubarb mix with the foie gras, but it was definitely a good eat. Our final dish was a organic pheasant served with farro in a pheasant jus reduction. There was also a pheasant mohawk thingy in it. Never had that before. About this time, I had to take a phone call, and had to leave the table for 15 min or so. My GF told me that the waiter was freaking out, worried about my dish getting cold. He brought over a lid to cover the dish until I got back, and worried once I did that the dish may have gone cold. What great service! Lastly for the lunch time dessert, we were served a Vermont Quark, a souffle served with a granny apple sorbet. How many times have you gotten a ice cream with dessert, only to have it melt all over the plate and you end up just drinking a soup? Eleven Madison has solved this problem. They served the granny apple sorbet on a small block of ice. The souffle and the unmelted sorbet went great together. We also added on a cup of coffee, and even that was picturesque. Every dish was stunning looking, and had unique flavors that I have never had before to make for the most expensive lunch I have ever had.', wow. just wow. presentation, top-notch service (posh without being pretentious) and amazing food made our dining extravagance complete. the waitstaff was very courteous and they added that extra flourish to each dish that arrived. i have to admit being a twentysomething i felt a little awkward having all eyes on our table (we were literally the first party there), but as more people filtered in, my reservations abated.our party of 3 ordered 3 courses each, and we oohed and ahhed at each plate. I had- provence asparagus which had a delightful chevre spread underneath and fresh, yummy quail eggs. the dressing was very savory and yummy.- muscovy (honey-lavender) duck...they actually bring out the duck, with lavender spears shoved in for emphasis. the slices were so tender and juicy. the lavender and honey really complement the salty flavor of the meat.- chocolate peanut butter palette w/popcorn ice cream--yes! it really tasted like popcorn! think buttery popcorn jelly bellys. the rest was a delightful chocolate-peanutbutter mousse with crispies inside.They also provide little hors d'oeuvres, the soup du jour and yet another dessert sampler platter when all is said and done. my only complaint would be that some of the appetizers were a bit on the salty side (the fennel soup, cheese puffs)., 'My wife and I vacationed in NY for her birthday and I took her to EMP for dinner. I had never had a multi course french dinner prior to this so i really didn know what to expect. My first thought as I walked in was gotham. The art deco elements had me feeling as if I were in a Batman movie. It is a huge voluminous room that does not feel especially warm. On the positive it is open and does not make you feel claustrophobic at all.We were seated promptly and received excellent service throughout the meal. On top of that, everyone was friendly and smiled which goes a long way towards an enjoyable evening. My wife and I both had the Gourmand tasting menu (although I don remember it being called that in 2006). She loved the egg trio and I really liked the grilled watermelon. The langoustines were also very delicious. I can remember everything on the menu but we were uncomfortably stuffed after the meal. I guess we didnthave to eat everything...right. Although it was not inexpensive, I feel we got what we paid for: a thoughtful well executed menu which you could not do at home, unique setting and great service.', 'Forget heaven - Eleven Madison Park is where I want to go when I die. (And hopefully many more times before then.)', i'm not in the position to write a proper review due to the fact that i've had about 16 hours of sleep since thursday and jetlagged and had to work today and waaah.but i can say right now that this restaurant was exquisite. bold dishes are put together so effortlessly i was amazed, and it all worked so very well. the service was stellar and was on par with gary danko.cocktails are also delightful.update to come after more sleep...******okay, i couldn't wait.cocktails were no exception to the decadently different tone of the menu.i started with the Greenmarket Asparagus with Lynnhaven Chvre Frais and Quail Eggs. OMG. i ordered this because I love asparagus and thought it was a perfect combo and it was. oh, how it was.Mister B had the Gazpacho of Cherry Lane Farm Strawberries with Hawaiian Blue Prawns and Guanciale, which had a lovely presentation--think big white bowl with this tiny clump of the prawns and that bacon lover's dream, guanciale smack dab in the middle. out comes a beautiful silver pitcher filled with the smoothest and most refreshing gazpacho you will ever have.our table shared the Foie Gras Seared with Rhubarb, Meyer Lemon and Breton Cookie Crumble. you can only imagine how wonderful it was.i had the Pan Roasted Arctic Char with Oregon Morels, Peas and Mint, which was great. i think, though, that they really shine with their appetizers.Mister B had the Bone Marrow Crusted Beef Tenderloin with Braised Beef Cheek and Spring Beans simply because we all wanted to know how the hell they could do that. plus, hey, c'mon. marrow. beef cheek. yum.for dessert we split the Vacherin--Lemon and Basil Parfait, Strawberries and Meringue, and also the Chocolate Peanut Butter Palette. Mister B does not like peanut butter, but he liked this. that's saying something, methinks.my palate is still savoring that lunch, which by the way is not for the frugal ;), Our one experience here was a mixed bag. In some ways excellent, even thrilling, but in some important ways a disappointment. There were two of us; we both ordered the two savory plus one dessert prix fixe, and didn't duplicate any orders. This gave us a total of 6 different dishes, plus a very generous assortment of amuse-type nibbles and surprises, and an extra dessert that came our way (possibly because the waiter knew we weren't thrilled with the restaurant's signature dish. But more on that later).The meal started at its high point: a tray of gem-like hors d'ouvres, assembled with sushi-like precision, with a mix of local American, traditional French, and Japanese-inspired ingredients. All these single-bite creations were perfectly crafted to melt in your mouth in just the right order (even if they weren't always designed to be picked up without disintegrating). They included perfect cubes of foie gras on on cracker-like pastry, a sushi-like roll of hamachi and bell pepper brunoise wrapped in daikon radish, puff pastry cones filled with rabbit, and at least a couple of others that I've forgotton.If the meal had been able to sustain this level of surprise and perfection throughout the courses that we ordered, it would have been mindblowing. Unfortunately, the chef tried to sustain the techniques and esthetics that worked so well for the amuses, without continuing to address the issues of how to make a dish inviting and easy to eat. We felt that the gem-like, sushi style just didn't work as well for the large plates. This was most evident with the restaurant's most celebrated dish, the suckling pig. In keeping with the chef's esthetic, there was no indication that you were eating a pig, suckling or otherwise. The presentation was a perfectly geometric rectangle of shredded meat, covered on top with a perfectly cut, crispy piece of skin. The sauce was a smear off to the side. The sauce was a work of perfection--perfectly clear, intensely flavored, balanced. But there was too little of it to moisten the meat, and the meat needed a fair amount of sauce. Part of our gripe was a stylistic one. We both felt that this style, which works for a sushi piece or an amuse, is misplaced with a suckling pig, where we want to enjoy sights, forms, and textures of the meat itself--not the unsurprising geometric contrivances of the chef. Part of it was a practical one--the food was neither particularly inviting nor easy to eat. We needed more sauce, we needed the meat evenly moistened in it, and it was difficult to make this happen. But the biggest part of our gripe was about execution, and this led us to assume we were there on an off night. The pork was just overcooked. It was dry, and while the flavor was intense it was also one dimensional. When I read Frank Bruni's gushing review of this dish, I didn't recognize anything in his description besides the name and the shape. I was stunned to learn that the pork had been poached in duck fat. How the hell do dry out heritage pork and get dimensionless flavor when you poach it in duck fat? Anyway, enough griping. The rest of our dishes fell between the extremes. The arctic char was adequate, but less flavorful that examples of this fish that I've had at much cheaper restaurants (or that I've made myself). The appetizers were better. The sockeye tuna appetizer was interesting and featured excellent fish, although the dish as a whole seemed to lack focus and wasn't especially memorable. The la ratte potato gnocchi was excellent.The desserts were uniformly great. They maintained the same geometric / constructed / precious esthetic of the rest of the meal, but thanks in part to their small size, they worked. The flavors were vibrant and fresh, the sorbets were perfectly made, and all of it was fun to eat. We left full but not stuffed.Service was friendly and attentive, almost to the point of feeling like ceaseless ass-kissing. I like good service (and expect it at these prices) but am personally more comfortable when the wait staff chills out a little. But they definitely took care of us and earned their tips.My recommendation, based purely on speculation, is that the tasting menu would show this restaurant in its best light. With luck you'll make it on a night when the cook at the poaching station stays awake. And if I'm right, the chef's esthetic will serve the small plates much better than it serves the large ones., 'I was in New York for business and brought my wife with me. She found the place as it was reviewed in the NY Times. At first I felt intimidated due to:(1) The price(2) They have a dress code(3) The price...I shouldn have stressed as when we arrived the staff made every effort to make us feel comfortable and welcome. I am a sucker for good professional service. The wait staff was top notch. Our head server Megan was excellent and knew as much about the food being served as the chef. The Sommolier was patient and extremely helpful in navigating the huge wine list. You are given several choices on a prix-fixe menu. While the portions were fairly small I felt that the service and presentation was top notch and enjoyed the show so to speak. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have only been there once so no additional data points. With regards to the price yes--it a little expensive but well worth it.', 'the service is extremely friendly and attentive, but i had 2 issues--  the prix fixe lunch is actually on a separate menu that was never given to us, but the price for it was given on the menu we had, leading us to believe we were ordering a prix fixe after an appetizer and an entree, i was hungry again an hour later--and $70 lighter.went to le cirque the next night and had a meal WORTH the money', 'I took my girlfriend here for dinner on her birthday. We each enjoyed the prix fix tasting menu and were delighted at the creativity and variety of textures and tastes. We enjoyed both unique ingredients as well as some of the more exotic preparations of traditional ingredients. It was an experience in fine dining that has yet to be matched. Service was attentive and friendly and were accommodating at finding a seat that was somewhat private. The dd9cor felt impressive and felt like a bank more than a restaurant but somehow still managed to pull it off without feeling too cold. The other patrons unfortunately put us off, as we were a pretty young couple in a restaurant that seems frequented by old money (in fact, we got looks from other patrons making us feel a little out of place despite us being well dressed and mannered) Nevertheless it was a pleasurable dining experience and we definitely go here again.', Everything is just right at EMP. The service is fantastic, but still human and personal, not too stuffy. The food is amazing. The gnocchi was so light and fluffy, loup de mer was great, and the suckling pig was outstanding. You are going to spend a lot, so go for the four courses. You'll leave with a full stomach and very satisfied by everything that has touched your tongue in those 2+ hours. (The atmosphere is also terrific - such a beautiful space!), Service and ambiance/decoration are the winning points for this review. I dined here for restaurant week and the service and ambiance left lasting impressions. The decor is simple and clean but the flower arrangements were gorgeous.Now to the food. No complaints on the food. I actually liked how they asked if we had allergies or if there were any foods we didn't like. Everything was fresh and cooked just right.I'm glad I checked this place out. I guess I'd go back on a special occassion but not anytime soon. There are too many other top notch restaurants in the city that I have to try., I made had reservations for a friday night dinner and was taken to the table promptly upon arrival. What did it for me was the gorgeous decor (classy and modern) and fantastic service. I thought the food was just ok but the chocolate souffle dessert was really good. Overall it was good times and worth a try if you haven't been., I love this place, Saturday was my 4th visit and every-time has been fantastic. The staff was particularly great since my girlfriend and I were completely shit-faced for the entire meal and the staff handled us with complete grace and humor, at least as far as we can remember and we're pretty sure the food was good too., We went here to celebrate a birthday and it was a wonderful experience. We started off with two glasses of champagne and then ordered dinner.The service was top notch. Couldn't have asked for better. The food was delicious. We had the skate and steak. Both dishes were wonderful but I kept on thinking I should have had the lobster instead. Decided against because I was in Newport the weekend before and ate lobster everyday.The presentation and quality was superb. I was a little disappointed with dessert but overall the dinner was excellent.Highly recommend coming here for a romantic evening with that special someone., I had a thoroughly enjoyable meal with multiple highs. For a eleven course meal, I left feeling great, not too stuffed and by no means hungry. The amuse was great in that you had an assorted variety from simple to indulgent ( tar tar, fois, etc..). The dishes I remember were the fois and suckling pig dish. The fois dish was actually the best I've had in a long time, and that includes my meal at per se. The dish was balanced perfectly between sweet and salty. It also came in 2/3 variations (can't remember, a while ago), all equally delicious. It was overall a fantastic meal. The only negative things I can say about it is they seated us in the back room, which I believe is not as grand as the main dining room, and that there were long waits in between courses during peak times. But I guess that's forgivable given the right companions. I am definitely going back to get the duck. It looked absolutely amazing, served whole, with lavender sprigs shooting out its cavity.|3
18|everest-chicago|French food on the 40th floor. This place is amazing! From the exquisite decor and wonderful view to the mouth-watering food. I had their seven-course set meal here and every course was fantastic. But I'd have to say they really did save the best for last -- the dessert was five different, absolutely tasty desserts decorated on one plate. This place was definitely really expensive but worth every penny! Make sure you make reservations beforehand and request a seat by the window -- you don't want to miss this spectacular view of the city., 'It really is the summit of Chicago dining as far as I concerned. Ie been to all the other major players, Trotter and Tru. Everest is just that little bit better than the others.The food is great, French cuisine with locally sourced ingredients. The view is fabulous. It great for a romantic dinner for two. The best thing is that they actually keep track of their customers. If you come here a few times, youl be treated like a celebrity. Wee only been a handful of times, but now we are always greeted with, Welcome back and are given a table by the windows.The service is formal without being stuffy. It friendly and approachable. The sommelier is so lovely. She young and really interested in assisting you with your wine selection.I can say enough about this place. It even better than many restaurants Ie been to in France.One note, if you go, make sure to get directions to the parking garage. It can be a bit tricky to find the first time.', I am going to break some Chicago-an hearts with this. But last night Everest was the height of disappointment after all the rave reviews. Ivo Soldoni's sculptures on each table were perhaps the only highlight of an otherwise stodgy even if grand setting. Everest has a good selection of wines. The food was not extraordinary, although I must concede the risotto was delicious. Here are at least three blemishes that we experienced during our short dinner:  When we asked for forks at one point, a member of the staff reminded us in a thick French accent that we were supposed to eat right off the cup/spoon--not sure if thanks are due for this lesson in fine dining. Bravo!  The server dropped a bread roll that bounced off the table on to an unsuspecting colleague's lap. Granted, a pardonable sin. What was less acceptable was that there wasn't a hint of apology. Hilarious!  To top off our experience, our favorite server spilled a generous amount of water on our dessert menu, and was too pre-occupied with who knows what to even take notice. Cool! I will not go here again unless I particulary enjoy scaling the Stock Exchange building and enjoying the views from Everest. Without having to pay for it, of course., 'When we were there the food was very high quality. However the service was a bit off, both servers did not know much about the food or what flavor the sorbet was when asked. The atmosphere is more of a classic french restaurant and the cliente is definitely much older.', Went here with my buddy Matt and my wife Mackenzie. Kenz was pregnant, so drinking was minimal for her. Matt and I did the wine pairings and we all did the grand menu.Overall this was really some darn good grub. The service was good as well. The sommolier was really personable and since she is our age, we talked with her a while and got some good recommendations from her about wine and other places to eat. I think that the wine was definitely good, but I hadn't been fully immersed in wines at the time I went and so my palatte was lacking. I do recall an exceptional Champagne to start things out (Premier Cru or the like I believe).We took the kitchen tour and the kitchen is pretty freakin' cool. Not as large as Tru, but larger than Trotter's. Overall tasty and worth the price tag if you can afford it., 'We were lucky enough to be seated at the window so that we could enjoy the magnificent view and sunset. Service was professional and very informative without being over-the-top. The food was delicious and seasonal. I especially loved the sweet corn risotto and the apple fritter dessert. YUM!', We went recently for our anniversary. Definitely a place for special occasions. The decor could use a little updating (leopard print carpet?!?). But the view, the food and the wine were excellent. We had a cozy table for two next to a window and went all out with the prix fix menu and wine pairings. The sommelier was great and she even offered to refill us if we had any favorites (duh! we did!). The only reason it's 4 stars rather than 5 is that there were a few hiccups in the service but I would still highly recommend it., We came here to celebrate a team milestone. Because it is on the top floor of the Chicago Stock Exchange, there was really tight security getting into the building and from one set of elevators onto the other. We booked a private room in the corner, with window view out into the city, which was great. The place was 101% fancy shmancy. Meaning, we had waitors who stand behind us and change our plates after every bite. It kind of gets on my nerves. My favorite part of a meal is picking at crumbs.My favorite here is the chocolate souffle. they took my order for it in the beginning; i thought this was odd, until i realized that they make it from scratch for you, so when the meal's finished, the souffle would be ready, hot and fresh. it was heaven., 'I had a dinner meeting at Everest on day. The view was absolutely spectacular and breath-taking! The food and wine were delicious. It is a well-hidden establishment. Parking was done through close-circuit security. It was kind of hard to locate parking as there were no signs, so you had better know where you were going. I really enjoyed Everest!', I loved the atmosphere here, from the super exclusive batcave valet and airy private rooms to the bronze sculpture centerpieces and the old New York feel. The view from the 40th floor is gorgeous, and overall the experience is very different than most high end Chicago restaurants. The service could not have been better, and the sommelier on duty was friendly and helpful. The highlights of my meal were the carnaroli risotto and the sunchoke soup starters.If you go, check out the website first to find out which artists' work will be on display and learn a little about them!, 'AMAZING.... the whole experience was awesome. I went there to celebrate an annivrsary and we sat by the window. Everything was great :)', Food: GreatService: GreatRoom: Cheesy as hell; with leopard print carpets and cheap looking glossy, white (or was it gray -- can't recall), Ikea-esque, Formica furnishings. Other than the amazing view, I felt like I was dining in some guy's bachelor condo from the 80s., 'I felt like I was in Eyes Wide Shut when I was making the trek up to the restaurant from the parking garage (which is free for Everest diners). Amazing food, nice view, more relaxed service than Tru.', great food, pretty decent service, though i almost felt like i was holding the menu for too long. Everyone at my table seemed to love the amuse bouche, the appetizers, and their entrees, and the wine list was approved by wine snob dinner companions. The decor was a little nuts, i lost track of the elevators, but the view was cool and I'd love to see it during the day. Try to sit on the east side of the room so you can see some of chicago skyline and the lake., 'I agree with Scott about the service. It makes the meal. I have been there many times and have never had a bad meal, but the service has been inconsistant. I have no idea why when they do this everyday. If I am spending $500 for a meal then the service must be worth the $100 tip. There can be no excuse. It just seems that whenever I go we are celebrating so much we turn the waiter into a guest. They had a new non-alcholic drink that tasted better than wine called AMEE, but they no longer carry it.. Shame on them. If you are adventuous get every desert on the menu and share. It is a riot. For me the suoflees are perfect,ly done, but just not that tastee. One last point. Make sure you bring people who can appreciate the place. The food is as good as it gets, but it is the attitude you bring to it that makes it worth the price.', 'I took a friend here for his B-day about two weeks ago. Outstanding. Everything from the service to the wine. I had the salmon, the lobster salad, and the new york that they cut and plate at your table. The chocolate souffle was a celebration by itself. And the view completes the whole experience. At $200 an hour this place gives you what no psychiatrist can. Your mental health. Would I go again? Yes. The best restaurant I have ever been to. Sorry Charlie.', I took my girlfriend here for our 4th anniversary, followed by a performance of the symphony. This restaurant was not my first pick due to cost but after the first one fell through I went through the Zaggat's book and found Everest. They were able to work with our times due to the symphony and we had a very memorable dinner that we gushingly talk about and vividly recall 6 months later. The lobster was a amazing art work for the senses. The chocolate souffle is not to be pass up on. Be prepared for many courses, such as a pre-appetizer and post-dessert selection of truffles, as we did not expect those exquisite and tasty bites when ordering. Our service met our expectations and was very good. The view was amazing (we were there around 5:30 and so it was fun to watch the city empty out and the surrounding areas fill up and slowly come to life. We enjoyed our wines which paired really well and were great suggestions by the sommelier. Everest was the start of an amazing celebration. We had a great experience with our first visit and hope to have more over the many years we plan to live in Chicago., Everest will cost you $400 for dinner, but the valet is free!Nice for a special occasion, perhaps, but at the end of the day there's no escaping that Everest is overrated. Some people really get off on dining at these kinds of places, where the presentation is as important as the food itself. I don't know, it makes them feel important and glamorous like they should be profiled in CS or something. If you're one of those people, then you'll probably love Everest so check it out. Maybe head to Rush Street afterwards.I'm not just hatin' -- I really wanted Everest to be as good as advertised. I took my wife here for her birthday, but the truth is if you've ever eaten at one restaurant like this before, then you've eaten at them all. Don't bother unless you just want to cross Everest off your list. The food is good, but for this price shouldn't it blow you out of your shoes? I can find you 20 places with better food for half the price (or even less). I will concede that the service is great, but again, how much do you really require out of your waiter? Pick a neighborhood restaurant and start tipping 25%. It won't take long for you to become a V.I.P. and you'll save enough to buy new golf clubs., Before I proceed I need to divulge that when I went to Everest I was an employee of Lettuce Entertain You and so I got 50% off. Also, the sommelier at Everest used to be the sommelier at Brasserie Jo, and he hooked us up with some great wine. Yes, I am a very lucky girl!Everest is by far the nicest restaurant I have ever been to. The view is incredible (I've uploaded a photo). The place was like a museum, though: everyone spoke in hushed tones, and the servers watched us like security guards, wearing suits and saying nothing as they stood with their backs to the wall. When it came time to actually wait on us they sprung into action and were very cordial and knowledgeable. We had a 6 or 7 course meal, starting out with an amuse bouche that consisted of a platter of unidentifiable food items arranged on little spoons. They were delicious. Everything was delicious. Highlights included escargot risotto and a single dish on which rested five different kinds of chocolate dessert items. All scrumptious! Chef Joho himself came out of the kitchen to thank us for coming, and provided a complimentary soup course. When I requested tea at the end of my meal I was thrilled to be offered a tea menu, even more thrilled when the busboy brought out a tiny teapot of looseleaf tea and asked me how strong I wanted my tea. When it was done steeping he returned and poured it for me. I laughed when we got the bill and I realized that the tea was $10! Well I guess they made it worth it.I don't know if I'll ever have the opportunity to return to Everest so I am glad I visited it while I could. If you go, ask David the sommelier to help you choose your wine. He's a great guy who really knows his stuff.Food: 5 starsWine: 5 starsService: 5 starsAtmosphere: 4 starsCost of meal, when getting 50% off: 100 stars, Everest is a phenomonal restaurant. The views are amazing and the food is excellent. I also LOVE the decor and ambiance.HOWEVER, our waiter was a complete snob and very rude- hence, the 3 star review. He wouldn't even offer a suggestion on the menu when I asked what his personal favorite entree was! It is one thing to attend to your guests and provide excellent service, but that doesn't mean you can't lighten up, gauge the personality of your table and act accordingly. I would go back again, I have only been there once. But I'm not raving because our waiter was a total jacka*s., 'I have been to many restaurant all over the US. This can be one of the best places I have ever been in terms of food, service and atmosphere. It is indeed expensive. However, you go there and you feel very special and important. The view is just breathtaking. The service makes you realize that the waiters are all VERY professional. The food is very satisfying in terms of taste and portion. They are classy, not pretentious.', I am not one to frequent restaurants like the Everest often. I don't have much experience in very high end/expensive restaurants like the Everest. However, I must say, nearly six months after visiting this establishment, I can still taste the delectable food and I can vividly remember my experience. The service was amazing as should be expected from a place like the Everest and I can only hope that they pay their workers good wages because the staff was amazing... everyone was there to serve, but not in an overbearing way that I've experienced at other places. The view from this top story restaurant is amazing and the atmosphere is really relaxing. The food was so amazing and I can't remember exactly what I had, but I ordered the create your own dinner deal where you can select an appetizer, main dish, and desert item for one price. The flavors were strong, but not overbearing and the food was high quality, but did not taste buried by oil or butter. There are a billion types of bread that they offer you and you can try different types each time they come by your table. They also had a variety of desserts for the last course (after the dessert that you ordered) which were displayed cutely so that you can choose the items that you want. The three course dinner that I was expected turned into a seven course dinner after it all. I left feeling so full and happy... it was amazing... I felt as though I could keep eating, even though I was stuffed beyond my wildest imagination. The Everest is a great date spot for a special night out with your partner, or for something before a play. They are very accommodating to any needs. I highly recommend the Everest!, 'Jen took me here for my birthday. Everest sits atop the 40th floor of the Chicago Stock exchange at the corner of the South-west loop, and the Chicago sky-line views are beautiful. Not to be outmatched, the food was perfectly amazing. When the first course arrived I was worried that the small portions would be inadequate for a full meal. By course #12 though, I was perfectly stuffed. The waiter was attentive, and kind. Not too snobby or pushy. My only complaint is that he did not adequately explain the prix-fix menu. From ignorance we ordered a special desert, which was $25 extra. But it turned out that the prix-fix dessert was tastier than the special souffl. That aside, given the opportunity I go back in a heart-beat. As as aside, join LEYE before you go, because youl definitely spend enough to earn a certificate when youe done.', My husband picked out this place for a private sit-down function. Its a little bit difficult to find this place and when you get to the lobby, the security guard was aloof about reservations. I was annoyed with this 10 minute delay. The chef's wine list (reserved wine) was fantastic and a great starter. I had their Russian caviar- great presentation, firm and creamy. Roasted Maine Lobster with butter and ginger-The best I've ever had. They removed the lobster shell and placed the whole lobster on the plate. Looked so great, too nice to touch.Dessert was to die for. ( It should be.)Cheese plate was okay. I asked for slices of green apples and they seemed confused...apples and cheese? How absurd!Over all, our meals-- $300/person including wine, four courses, port and coffee. And you get to blow all your money with a great view., This place is such a rip off!! They actually served soup in a little like thimble., we thought it was a joke.The only positives were the breads,and sweets that you were served. Our waiter was actually a decent sort but their were so many stuffed shirts up there it was crazy.We came for the price-fixe menu and we got such a little amount to eat . They make such a production out of nothing! If you are in one of the party rooms facing the lake its an awesome view but to pay 70.00 per person for food that would all comfortably fit on a small saucer? Do yourself a favor and don't bother, I went here for a dinner meeting and was a bit disappointed with the food. The only thing I really liked was the white wine. And maybe also the view of the city, but it was just the south loop and you could see the Roosevelt Target very well. The bread was boring, and we could only get one piece at a time. The salad was not very exciting. The main course consisted of a small round steak (I think medium rare, but looked rare) with a bland mashed potato dollop, a small round salmon filet (didn't really taste like salmon) with beans, with five pieces of asparagus and carrots to end it. i was hoping the dessert would at least be good but it was also not so great, some sort of chocolate pie, which didn't taste like chocolate. A lot of people who also came to the meeting didn't know about how to get to the restaurant. Luckily I read through their website ahead of time, to know that there are 2 elevators to get to the restaurant., Some of these reviews are making me laugh, because it's making me realize that I rate places pretty much on food alone, not decor or atmosphere. But the others are correct, this place is stuck in the 80's. The waitress seemed to be stuck in the 80's as well. But the food was amazing. I had a NY Strip, may have been the best steak I've had in Chicago., was in chicago for a week and want to try something other than American food. Pick this place from travel guide and here is what I have to say about this place.Location is a bit tricky. It took us a while to find it. Environment is okay, too bright for a French restaurant.Waiter was very nice and not pushy. His name is Troy.Semi formal, wear a jacket if you want to sit by the windowsfood is not as good as French Laundry but acceptable. Don't get the duck because for some reason it was a bit dry even when we asked for rare. 300 bucks for 2 of us with a glass of wine., Once you actually find the restaurant you can rest assure that anything you order will be exceptional. I mean, dude, the tangerine soup half way through the degustion made me weep. The room definitely has preferred seating and not every waitstaff is there wholly to attend to your needs. The pace of the degustion dinner is even and not at all pushy, but you also don't have to worry about paying the babysitter exactly what you'd promised. Decidedly a special occasion meal, but try them for lunch for great food and a lighter bill., Everest was my first experience with French food and now I am hooked! The service was excellent and well orchestrated. The tasting menu is the only way to go! The twelve courses are presented like small pieces of art with new flavors and textures that open your taste palette to a new world. The view is facing west towards the suburbs which is really interesting. I do hold Charlie Trotter's over Everest because Trotters offers juice flights. Yet, hands down the view and decor of Everest is better that Trotters., 'Very pricey, but wonderful atmosphere, beautiful surroundings, excellent food, extremely nice wine list, staff was always there which at times made me slightly uncomfortable but I got used to it. We had the tasting menu and we were not disappointed, and the window view is incredible. It was a lovely birthday treat, but definitely a treat!', 'This was a very nice dining experience. From the time we arrived we were treated to very good service. After we were seated I looked around and decor is nothing to much, the views are nice though. As for the food it was all very delicious. Lobster, New york steak and finishing touch the souffle. What the!! I need more. The wine choices we made were also very good. This was indeed a very nice and enjoyable evening.', 'Decided to take the gf here for the early portion of NYE 2009. The journey up to the restaurant led to much anticipation. Once seated, it seemed a bit uncomfortable at first, possibly because my girlfriend and I were slightly younger than most of the crowd @ Everest. Once service began and I decided on a bottle of wine, the night was great. I was astounded by the food and did not want the meal to end. The restaurant itself is romantic and a great spot for special occasions.', 'To start, I should point out that my wife and I got the 8 course Tasting menu (it was our anniversary, we had gift certificates, etc).To start, the decor here is extremely dates. When we walked in, I remarked to my wife that I expected to turn around and see Patrick Bateman doing a line of coke off of one of the tables - this place is stuck in about 1985.The food, as compared to the tasting menus at Charlie Trotters and Tru, was sorely lacking.First, we ordered only a $100 bottle of wine (which is probably in the 5th percentile of prices here), and the waiter looked at us as if we were the cheapest heels he had ever seen.The first course was a trio of Amuse Bouche - a celery root foam (actually tasty), a lobster bisqe (OK, but Ie had better at much cheaper prices), and what passed as a fish stick (my wife asked if the Gorton Fisherman was the sous chef.Next was cold lobster on a plate. Literally. There was a tasteless white sauce that had the consistency of a bodily fluid that dare not be named. I was relieved when it only tasted like nothing.Next was french onion soup. Now, I like french onion soup. But when wee dropping $400+ for dinner, I expect more than soup flavored with onions and pieces of oxtail (about the cheapest meat on this earth).Following this crusted skate wing with mashed potatoes - again, a dish I would expect at a haute cuisine restaurant. There were several other items on this plate, but 3 courses ago, the waiter decided to stop explaining to us what was being served (a custom at fine dining places - especially with tasting menus. We did notice other tables were still getting an explanation). It was OK. Next, we had duck. Again, I not sure what else was here. It was cold.After this course, I left for the bathroom. when I returned, a piece of sorbet was half melted over a fruit/gelatin puree - they had served me a frozen dish when I wasn there! The sorbet tasted like Lemon Pledge (that you would use to clean your furniture) smelled.Following this was a cheese course - unprepared by Everest. This was actually ok, as were desserts.Ie been to both Tru and Charlie Trotters, and walked out of both feeling that no meal would justify the $400 - $500 for two you would spend. Everest was significantly worse. My largest complaint was that the money you spent didn appear on your plate - they used cheap ingredients (oxtail (repeatedly), cabbage, onions) and used minimal preparation. This is French food in name only, which is shocking, as Chef Joho runs a perfectly good French Brasserie (Brasserie Jo). Stay away - especially if Patrick Bateman shows up.', F this F'ing place! This place is an absolute joke. We kind of stumbled upon this place last night (yes stumbled, even though you need a map to find it). We decided at the last minute to try this place out, and what a mistake it was. The only thing more smug, pompous, pretentious, dull, arrogant, shallow, miserable, stuffy, fake, and annoying then the service staff were the actual other customers. Our head waiter (if that's what they are even called) was possibly the most annoying creature on the planet. We went with the 3 course meal, and when we selected the salad as our appetizer, he rudely insisted we get something else like lobster, oysters, etc. I finally had to tell him that we ordered the salad because that is what we wanted, so move along. Why even list the salad as an option if your staff is going to ridicule the customers when they select it!?!? The food wasn't even that good, and considering its $100 a plate, I expected it to be. The views out the window on the 40th floor of the Stock Exchange did seem nice, although we weren't seated directly at the window. It's probably a good thing we were not seated there, because I may have been inclined to toss the waiter out one. As dry as the service was, I suppose I understand why they are the way they are when observing the other clientele. What a miserable group. No one seemed to be enjoying themselves. It was like being at a slave owner's convention in the 1800s held at the local library. We were by far the youngest people in the place (I'm 32, GF is 29). I wouldn't go back for free...., 'exquisite and exclusivehard to find, but it makes you feel good your a part of it. the food was great, service sucks a big one, and the clientel for the most part does seem bored. i went last year with my gf and we had a good time. its hard to argue the food. view was great, food was solid, but yes the service is overly pompous, rude, and disrespectful.', 'A wonderful evening! Love the decor, the view is dramatic and thrilling. Yes, it expensive and mostly it worth it. I don think it on the level of Tru or Alinea, but it certainly up there. I love the car service which is offered. The wait staff know their jobs but could have been a little more polished--some of the uniforms were improperly fitted and water glasses were never refilled, but plates were always properly placed. I don prefer it though that the staff takes a plate away without asking, May I remove this course? If the silverware is placed closed on the plate, then you may remove it. The stemware was beautiful too. The place is formal but that doesn mean you have to be all quiet and uptight. Although we were a party of three, we think we really enlivened the room when we arrived, we didn fall for the stuffiness or rudeness that others have mentioned, and I think the waitstaff really enjoyed that. Go, have a good time, do the wine pairings, ask lots of questions, ask to meet the chef--have a good time.', I got engaged in 2005 and after he popped the question we went to Everest. It is a lovely restaurant -- I love French food and French wine. The view is fantastic. The prices are exorbitant. The service is excellent. The food is ridiculously rich -- wowza. They gave us a book when we left about French Wine ... I still have the book. I don't have the fiance anymore. Phew. Dodged that bullet! ;) I'd go back on a special occasion. It's very expensive., 'I with Paul on this one - get over yourself, Everest! I went here with my husband on a weeknight for dinner and was truly unimpressed with the snooty attitude shown us. We came straight from work and were early, so it is not like they were crowded yet, but we were still ignored. We ordered and were criticized on our choices and when I only ordered a glass of wine (he doesn drink it, and I not a booze hound yet so I not ordering a bottle!) you would have thought I washed my hand in the water glass!The worst part was that the next morning, I awoke with severe food poisoning - so bad I had to call for my mom to help me get to the hospital. When she called the restaurant to see if anyone else had reported symptoms (to try and help diagnose what caused it) they told my mother I must have eaten bad food elsewhere that day. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, I called the restaurant where I had lunch and they were very kind and sympathetic, but had no calls or problems (plus, what I had there was not meat or seafood and couldn be undercooked). I sicked the City Health Department on Everest for their crappy behavior and eventually found out that it was tainted seafood that had caused the illness. I will NEVER go back to this over-priced and under-clean hell hole.', I don't know... This place is a bit too much for itself. Obviously you go there for special occasions and they treat you like royalty. The food IS good but its really not amazing - I went there a few months ago and I really don't remember what I ate. The view is pretty nice but the decor is a joke. It is the worst 1980s nouveau riche atmosphere I think I've ever seen, seriously. I think Gordon Gekko would've hated it. Like the food and the bill, I think its just a bit too heavy. But yeah, you can definitely impress the s**t out of some people if you take them there, so if that's your goal, do it!!Seriously if you are in it for a good meal (though not so neatly presented) then I think Johos 1/20th of the price restaurant Brasserie Jo is actually better., The Last Supper.That's what I called my 21st birthday dinner here. I had the chef's tasting menu, and it was delicious...down to the last bite. I had 11 courses, including the birthday dessert. I couldn't eat anything else for the rest of the week.The service was amazing. My brother and sis-in-law joined me for dinner, and due to her shellfish allergies, the kingcrab plate was replaced by a 24kt risotto dish. Bread came around constantly, and my server had the best recommendations for wine pairings. Not to mention, I received a signed copy of the menu by Chef Joho. :)You cannot go wrong with the Everest -- okay, maybe with the directions. It took awhile to get to the restaurant from where I was coming from, but the security guard took the matters in his hand.Thanks Everest for an unforgettable birthday!, One of the best views in the entire city. And the food wasn't too bad either., 'SNOOOOOOT! OK, so, I pride myself on being able to dine anywhere and fit in perfectly. Never have I been so annoyed by the attitudes of those around me...I talking about the waitstaff mostly. I found the decor to be dated, and the service annoying. When we did not want to order a bottle of wine, the waiter snottily asked, What would you like to order...water perhaps? I found the food to be just OK, nothing to write home about. I happy for those of you who didn notice the attitudes around you. As for me, I wouldn go there again. There are too many nice restaurants in this city to waste my time at a place where the wait staff makes you feel like you should be serving them.', We came here a few years ago, but I still remember loving this place. This was a choice of ours before we saw a show since they had the pre-show prix fixe choice. The dining room is very elegant and the service here is IMPECCABLE. The view is great in the early evening. Our waiter was very patient with our lack of French vocabulary and interpreted whatever we asked. Unlike some other reviews, we didn't get the snooty-ness that night. The food tasted great, the portions were on the smaller side, but the taste made up for it. Great for a nice night out or a celebration., We went here for our anniversary, and it was good, but not spectacular. The view was spectacular with 290 extending to the horizon, and we were there when it was VERY slow. There were maybe 15 diners for 3 hours. The food was good, not plentiful, but not spectacular. The service was good, very attentive, yet not stifling. I wouldn't go back because there are so many good restaurants in Chicago, why not try others?, Wow. I've never been anywhere so high up! My boyfriend and I went here on a lovely fall Wednesday evening, and were treated like the king and queen of england the whole night. I thought they'd treat me differently because of my tattoos, but the guy with the wine had a full sleeve under his nice suit, B.A.! We had a wonderful meal, everything was so foreign, but so tasty. I had some amazing cold corn soup with lobster at the bottom of it. I am now trying to figure out how to make this for myself. Want to have a get dressed and feel fancy night? Go to Everest., Very expensive. Very OVERrated.We were disappointed after reading for years about Everest.The view is OK, not spectacular.The service was good. The food was good. The wines overpriced.Once was enough for us.Six friends went together and we ordered several bottles of wine to share, a different one for each course plus before dinner cocktails.We didn't stint ourselves, but I just don't want to go back again.It seemed that they are floating upon past repute rather than maintaining., Although the view is nice, the decor needs some updating. The service was very good and the wine explanations and pairings were excellent. The food didn't blow me away, but it was still very impressive. The tasting menu is the most robust of all of the high end restaurants in the city, so be sure to pace yourself accordingly. I was very pleased to see Chef Joho actually there mingling with diners. When making a reservation, be sure to request a seat near or at the windows., If you want to spend $1000 on a bottle of wine, this is the place for you. One of the best wine lists on earth, if not the best. For all practical purposes, a lower end bottle will be about $120 to start. Being one of the most expensive restaurants I've ever been to, it was by far not the best. I can think of so many other places I'd rather be, it's not worth my time rating their food, service, nor atmosphere. Try Cite if you want a high up view, and try any Chicago steakhouse if you want a beautiful meal. Unimpressed., 'You kind of feel like you are back in time a bit - art deco decor - lots of fabric. I thought it was very interesting. Service was great!!! Food was delicious but be prepared to spend ALOT of money - we decided on the seasonal tasting menu. The wine list is great but also very pricey. I may go back again but like many reviewers I feel like I have had better meals elsewhere.', Let me start by saying that my husband and I are middle class so we don't have a lot of experience with places as expensive as Everest. This was a special evening out to celebrate the birth of our daughter and our first date night so my husband planned this to surprise me. I have to admit, we were not impressed. With the meal, 1 bottle of wine and a tip it cost $450 for the both of us. I would expect that for that price, every bite of what I ate would give me a foodgasam and taste like 5 stars. We have dined for 1/2 the cost and can still remember the food years later compared to this. Of the 4 starters only 2 were excellent (the MI chestnut bouillon and the lobster w/butter and ginger). The lamb dish was very, very, good (but again, not quite excellent) and the venison was also very good but the side of gnocci tasted blah. The desserts were good and flavorful but not earth shattering. The service was excellent but the dinner was not worth the cost. Oh, and if you are going for the decor/view, forget it, not impressive-have to agree with many other reviewers who said it was like a flash back to the 80's mixed with deco., We were WOW'D!Top of the stock exchange building in the South Loop...the food, the customer service, the ambiance...WOW! I am soo proud of my city...if you ever have a chance to go to beautiful Chitown...save some money and dine at Everest..it will be well worth the experience!!I am cultured, admit to loving foody-ism =) love food, have an open mind, am somewhat confident in my standards but the stuffiness which comes with the fancy shmancy intimidates me sometimes...which I was expecting at Everest...our server and sommelier were amazing....knowledgeable, approachable, friendly, courteous, competent and smiling...ahh yess...this vibe started out our night as soon as we sat down...all open windows surrounding the restaurant..to view the beauty of Chicago...breath-taking....I can say..this is by far, one of THEE best meals I have EVER experienced...top 5 for certain...I can speak for 2 of us...OH MY....we were making love with our food...the taste, the presentation, the wine pairings...enough said...OH, wait, I lie...can't forget...BEETS...Zach, who dined with me, HATES beets....I like them...we both LOVED...apparently there is a lengthy time process involved in making the beets..I never thought something so simple could be SO amazing on the palate..our server provided the deets once we asked...they wer like sugar...nothing like it...Spending a lot of money on dining is hard to do sometimes...This is probably thee most expensive restaurant I have ever dined....I thank Zach over and over and over again for takin' me here....a dream come true...I highly recommend it to all! A dining experience indeeed!Enjoy!, I was not impressed with the food here at all. You're paying a premium for the chef's name and location, but the food does not live up to what it should be. The ambiance is romantic, quiet, and geared for older couples. Indeed, the demographics of the other patrons when I was there was ~40s-60s. If you're looking for a 5-star experience, I would say Spiaggia is much better!, My husband and I dined here on Valentine's Day, so obviously this review is a little late in the game but still worth writing. I'll cut write to the chase, you are not paying for just the food here, you are paying for the overall experience (which obviously includes the superb food). So be willing to drop a couple hundos because that is what an experience like this will cost (at least for the prefixed V-day menu). With that said: It. Was. Worth. Every. Damn. Penny.Let me preface by saying my hubby and I don't frequent these kinds of joints often. We're strictly casual 90% of the time. The fact that it was V-day was incidental, coupled with some other things we were celebrating (new place, promotion at work etc.). So I have no idea how a place like this stacks up against other topnotch restaurants. For us, it was definitely a rare treat which made the whole experience that much more special.Everest is on the 40th floor of the Stock Exchange building, and it was sort of an adventure getting there (think secret garage, two separate elevator banks etc.) But once we were seated in a private dining room, the sunset views from the wall-to-floor windows were amazing, which set the tone for the rest of the night. I might be biased, but I think we have the best skyline. Period.I'm not a French food enthusiast, but I loved everything they served over a 6-7 course experience. Presentation was beautiful, execution was flawless and the portions were just right. Our dinner experience lasted nearly three hours, but we didn't have food coma symptoms after, we just left pleasantly full. Looking for ambiance? Everest has it in spades, from the view, to the music, to the lighting. Hands down most romantic dining experience of my life.If you want to pull out all the stops, go for the wine pairing. We got to sample lots of varietals, and even though we didn't love all of it, it was fun to experiment and go outside our go-to staples. Service was superb, the staff was very approachable and knowledgeable, which was a pleasant surprise considering the shi-shi vibes we got upon entering the main dining room. Would we go back? Maybe. This strikes me as a singular experience though. It was fun while it lasted...but definitely worth trying once., 'Wee fallen out of love with Everest. We returned to Everest recently to celebrate our decade anniversary. We returned because our prior experience, which was about 1 1/2 years ago, was so wonderful, and the food then was absolutely divine. On our recent return, it was just okay. I think service is still great (though they were really busy that night so the staff seemed all over the place, but that was alright because we weren neglected). Since my fiance said it was our anniversary, I think the staff said Happy Annversary to us more than half a dozen times. It nice to hear it once or twice, but six times was way overdone. Moving on to the food...fiance had the lobster app, which was phenomenal, he said. I had the foie gras, expecting it to be some of the best Ie had and expecting it to pop in my mouth. It wasn some of the best and it didn pop. In fact, you could get better from a steakhouse. Fiance strip was good, and a very generous portion. I got the lamb, and received 2 small ribs. Huge disparity in entree portions. Finally, we both got the souffles in different flavors, and were both disappointed. While disappointed with our meal as it wasn as good as our prior visit, the wine list still remained impressive and offered rare bottles. Probably won go back for a long time.', 'Went for a celebration dinner with two colleagues and we ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairings. As a veteran of tasting menus from around the world I feel honestly in applying the term... not worth the money... to this meal. The food was good. It was not spectacular, but more disappointing was that not one dish stood out, nor did they fall into a nice flow of one dish to the next. My greatest gripe was the wine stewards. The great tasting menus have wine stewards who explain the reason behind the pairing. At everest we had,  The wine is XXXXX from XXXX and they would pour and leave. For the 1000 meal we woulde like the xperienceto be better. The food is good, but not 300 per person good.', I love fine cuisine and have been looking forward to eating here for months. Our overall expieriance was lack luster. Our waiter was rude. He had 2 tables to wait on the entire evening and chose to ignore our requests for drinks, bread and the check at the end of the meal. I told the manager on the way out of the restaurant who merely shrugged his shoulders. After spending 689.00 you expect at least friendly service. Now, onto the cuisine. The food was so/so. I enjoy fine dinning and I've had much better expieriances at Tru, Nomi or Marche. I would reccomend one of these places instead., 'I was treated to my birthday dinner last month since it was one of the restaurants Ie been wanting to try for a few years. Instead of the tasting menu, we opted to order a few dishes each. We started with an ounce of the caviar which was so delicious (but really quite pricey). We then had for starters the clam risotto and foie gras. I think the fois gras was my favorite part of the meal. For our main dishes I had the escolar with the mushroom bouillon and my date had the duck and turnips. My main course caught me off guard because I was expecting a really light subtle dish. However, it was quite rich in mushroom flavor and almost had a homey-ness to it. My date thought his duck was ok. For dessert I had the chocolate souffle which I thought was very good. My date had the alsace vacherin which he thought was amazing. I really enjoyed my dinner at Everest, but I will say the experience fell short just a little. Maybe this is my fault in that I hyped it too much in my head. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is a throwback to the nineties. Not the grungy nineties, but the preppy country-club-esque nineties. I guess you can say the restaurant is frozen in time, not that this is a bad thing. Its a nice change from the modern, contemporary flair found in a lot of the high-end restaurants. And finally, I wish I remember our server name, but he was by far the best server Ie ever had. He was attentive, very very nice and informative.', 'Everest came up short on overall value for a fine ining experience. The service was good but a bit dry. The feel was a tad on the stuffy side. The food was good, and the wine parings were excellent.That being said however my bill of $521.68 for two people felt dramatic for the overall experience.While I realize that this location is considered one of Chicago Big 4, I came away feeling like if it were $150 cheaper, I would have been much more satisfied.I won be returning but I would recommend it as a Chicago staple for fine dining once in your life. Next year Il be trying either Charlie Trotter or Tru.', Very good. We were there early (pre theatre) and so were only 2 of 6 diners there at first. Dinner was unrushed, took 2+ hours and service was excellent. We both had the 3-course option. I had 1) roasted maine lobster in Alsace gewurztraminer butter and ginger sauce; 2) slow-poached filet of wild escolar, braised leek, mushroom bouillon; 3) Michigan rhubarb souffle. My BF had 1) crusted pork cheeks, poached lamb's tongue, choucroute salad, petite ravigote; 2) rack of lamb, sweet garlic flan, ragout of artichokes and favas; 3) caramel custard - can't remember the name of this exactly but it was delicious.Without a doubt, the fanciest dinner I've ever had. A memorable experience!|1
19|frances-san-francisco|I dined at Frances for the soft opening. I find this restaurant very neighborhoody and upscale with great southern European mix of food. The space was very inviting and chic. Noise level is acceptable: People can actually talk without shouting. The temperature is a bit low for me but most men would be comfortable there. Service was perfect: All the people there were very well informed and answered all the questions without problems. In terms of food, we (me and my dining companion) had followings: Bouches - Meatball with salsa Verde: my dining companion loved it. Olives and almonds was good. Olives are warm. Almonds were toasty. Appetizer - Chicory salad: good especially wit persimmon Entree - Ling cod with fennel and manila clam was the best of all. Fish was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Manila clam makes broth tasty. Potato was nice addition to the dish. It really soaks up the broth. My dining companion had braised beef which was good. It was nicely paired with Broccolini. Dessert - Mandarin cake was very light and tasty. Chocolate ganache was too chalky and dark. It would have been better with coffee which we didn't have. Overall, this is a great place where you can have a great meal for $50-70 per person. I will definitely go back!!!, 'Dashed over to Frances for the soft opening last night and was pleasantly surprised with how smoothly things ran. Upon calling to see if they were slammed, they graciously offered to save me a table and greeted me by name when I arrived. The interior is nicely appointed with dark wood and clean lines, interesting lighting fixtures, coasters etc. Although some creative house cocktails are offered, we went with a very reasonably priced Cava from the bubbles section of the wine list ($26). The list has a selection of light and crisp whites, dry and versatile whites, well balanced whites with a hint of sweetness, easy drinking reds with some fruit and so on. I was also happy to hear that they offer filtered still and sparkling water at no additional cost. The menu includes bouchd9es (small bites), appetizers, entrd9es, and sides. We started with a decadent chestnut soup with pancetta, sweet roasted cipollini onions, and a garnish of winter greens, very rich and delicious! Next we had gnocchi with duck confit. The gnocchi were very light yet had a perfect sear on them. The broth and confit were amazing and hit all the craveable salty, meaty notes. This dish also had winter greens and was similar in color to the soup, but I would definitely order it again. For our entree, we had ling cod wrapped in lardo on a sweet squash puree w/ Brussels sprouts and apples. While the cod was perfectly cooked, we felt that the sweet aspects of the dish overpowered the light flavor of the fish. The side of creamed winter greens was vibrantly green (i.e. not overcooked) with a light cream sauce. We passed on dessert as we had a cheese plate waiting for us at home. The wine director overheard us discussing recent article on the lowest priced bottle on the list and joined our conversation. We gave him some feed back and said that we thought it was a great addition to the neighborhood. All of the waitstaff appears to have experience and Frances seems to be avoiding the usual opening issues that restaurants can face. 4.5 stars.', 'I have been watching the progress of this new neighborhood restaurant with interest and was surprised to find they were taking walk-ins for their soft opening so I said..why not?? I absolutely loved the almonds that were offered by a cheerful member of the service staff at the beginning of the meal. I started with the Chestnut soup with the Roasted Cipollini and pancetta. The soup was bowl lickin good, but sadly it didn have the strong chestnut flavor I was expecting. The Chicken with Chanterelles, Fennel and Nectarine Agrodolce was succulent and full of flavor. The rolled, boneless breast looked like a very time consuming prep job, but I am glad someone went to the trouble, the crisp coating of skin?seemed almost Tempura like and I savored every bite. I had a lovely glass of Muscadet with the soup and a somewhat cloudy glass of Brouilly with the chicken. Both wines were at perfect temperature and poured at the tableas they should beand reasonably priced. I did think that the pours were a tad bit restrained which bordered on stingy. The highlight of the evening was the Chocolate Ganache Torte which I would be willing to wait in line for if they sold it on the street! It was perfection!! I savored every bite and the glass of Banyuls was the perfect accompaniment. The only real disappointment of the dinner was the Espresso that was so bitter it bordered on rancid. It could be that the staff still hasn worked out the kinks in their new Espresso machine or the grind may still need to be adjusted, but it was hands down awful. That will have to be corrected for the coffee loving San Franciscans. The restaurant design is interesting, however I could imagine the space approaching the restrooms could be a real noise magnet if a large boisterous group were parked there. The bathroom had rolled hand towels which were a very nice touch and I am sure that can be attributed to the hotel background of the chef. I will be curious to see if they will be able to maintain these amenities when the restaurant is in full operation. I wanted to love this restaurant and I really think it will be a go to place for people in the neighborhood as well as a destination spot for savvy San Franciscans, and as soon as the dust settles I will be back and will update this review. The Castro neighborhood really needs an intimate dining choice where people are serious about what they are doing and this could definitely be it. Il keep my fingers crossed! There seemed to be an army of service staff and yet I didn feel any sense of urgency in the way things were carried out; this is all a part of a new place though and I am sure they will polish every detail before the masses descend on this place as I am sure they will. Service was professional, affable and not overbearing...all good things in my book. I hope the next visit will have me adding two more stars to this review. Good Luck to all involved!', Best house wine ever - a blend of syrah, grenache, and cab. And it's $1/ounce! We tried the bacon beignets, albondigas (very tender and delicious moorish spice seasoning), grilled calamari (really fresh and tender) from the bouchees part of the menu.From the appetizers, we had the chestnut soup (yummy pancetta) and the chicory salad (quite a hefty salad with tasty almonds and persimmons).For our entree, we shared the slow cooked beef with kale, potatoes and fried onions. For a second day of this new restaurant, service was excellent and can only get better. The ambiance is nice and intimate, and the noise level easy for conversation.I had Chef Melissa Perello's cooking at Fifth Floor, and it's nice to taste some of her more casual food, yet still complex and refined. I'm sure this place will do just fine., And on the third day, they gave us Frances. Perfect chilly night for slow roasted beef, soul food chicken, light & fluffy gnocchi with duck confit (gasp, not a cream sauce?), bacon donuts (beignets) and squash frites. By and far one of the better meals I've had lately. The $1/ounce wine was jammy, fruity and perfect. The two stars were the beef and the squash ($23 and $6.50 respectively). The beef was tender, moist with a perfectly crunchy crust; the gnocchi and duck were surprisingly light and fluffy and lean; each with light sauces that complimented the wine just right. Service did take a bit longer than you'd expect, especially with 9:45 p.m. reservations, but can be explained because the place was packed; but with good wine and good-sized portions...the wait is unnoticeable because the food eclipses it. Cozy, warm and inviting. Great., YES PLEASE.can't wait to go back., 'Fantastic. We had the frites, bacon beignets, salad, gnocchi, chicken and cod...all delicious. So great to see a new restaurant hire professionals who have their act together...and in the first week!', 'Eagerly we waited for Frances to open in this seemingly cursed space. It was worth the wait. From lovely service, prompt, delicious almond treats, clever taster cocktails and stunning flavors of the Chicories, Cannelloni, lovely wine -it all just clicked. Such a relief after suffering the grossly over-rated bummer of Starbelly. We are delighted to have Frances. Bon appetit!', Love it!Went to the opening night with my wife and we split two small plates, one entree, and a desert.The wine selection is pretty long (I love how the wines are categorize). The beer selection wasn't extensive but they had a great Belgian golden ale that I really enjoyed.Service was a bit over-attentive due to the fact that they had doubled up on staff for opening night, but that's not really a bad thing.The space is really nice and cozy, I can imagine spending cold Sunday nights here with a big plate of slow cooked beef and potatoes.I'll definitely be returning!, 'Imagine if you will: It Saturday, after 8 PM, and you don have reservations anywhere. Normally, this would be cause enough to lock the door, pull out a tub of frosting and a spoon, watch infomercials and curse my luck-less life. Last night was different, though. And Frances was the new variable.My BF got on Open Table and discovered that Frances, the much anticipated new restaurant in the Castro that we had both read about, had a 10 PM reservation available. I dropped my trusty frosting spoon and shouted, Book it!!! I waited for confirmation before wiping the cream cheese deliciousness from my formerly frowning mouth; there no excuse for wasting napkins. Finally, after a few agonizing seconds, I was able to breathe a sigh of relief and return the frosting to its hallowed spot in the pantry. We were in. We arrived a few minutes before 10 and were greeted by a friendly host. He recognized my name and handed us a drink/wine list and also pointed out the curiously framed white board they use to list daily specials. We stepped to the side and checked out the wine list and the decor. Frances is small but cozy. We were both taken with the light fixtures over the counter seating. Very nice.While we were waiting, a server came up to us with a couple of the restaurant Market Shots. They consisted of huckleberry, white wine, kaffir lime and honey. They were really tasty and normally just $3. Our were on the house. Thanks Frances!!After about 10-15 minutes we were seated (a table was available earlier, but the host told us it was a cramped space, so we opted to wait a little longer). Seating at Frances is very cozy, almost European. They have chosen to utilize as much of the space as possible with many two-tops placed close together. Be prepared to meet your neighbors.After swapping life stories with our new dinner neighbors, we began to peruse the menu. Since it was late, they were out of the beef dish (which was a little disappointing), but there was much more on the menu to try out. We decided to start with some squash frites, applewood smoked bacon beignets, and albondigas with salsa verde. The squash frites were great and the beignets were bacony and fluffy. I was a little disappointed with the albondigas, but I think that was mostly because the flavors didn mesh with the other two dishes. Next, we had the gnocchi with duck confit. By far, this was my favorite dish of the evening and I can recommend it enough. At the end of the night, I told the owner/chef that I wanted to bathe in the gnocchi because it was so delicious (I not sure exactly who it was but I really appreciated her walking around the dining room and talking to us). For an entree, we chose to share the cod dish. It was perfectly cooked and the flavors were spot on. Cod can be a little bland but this was far from bland. I would have loved to try the beef dish, but this was a great second choice.Add to this a carafe of the house wine (at $1 an ounce) and then we wrapped up the night with the Valrhona chocolate ganache tart with McEvoy Olive Oil ice cream and some Blue Bottle coffee (which was $4 and served in a Chemex carafe--easily 3 cups of coffee).All in all, I loved it. We spent around $92 for two people, and I thought it was totally worth it. Thanks to the Frances staff for a terrific late night dinner (and I hope we didn keep you there too long after closing!).', 'fantastic to have another neighborhood restaurant open up near home, especially by well-regarded (SF Chronicle, Food and Wine, James Beard awards!) chef Melissa Perello.service is impeccable, and food is very good. 2 of us, with ummmm 28 ounces of wine ($1 an ounce! how can you resist?) was $108 before tip. no service or food hiccups and we were day on night 2 after their opening!

DELICIOUS.a bit expensive for a neighborhood resto (everything around it is residential), but also much better food than you expect. worth a try, and il be back! also, the staff try really seems to CARE that youe there, which is such a nice change from most hot new restaurantsthanks, Frances.', 'Finally, after nearly 20 years of living in the Castro, there is now one of the city top chefs with a restaurant that does rival the best San Francisco has to offer.Melissa Perello has been heralded as not only one of the Bay area top chefs, but has received extremely positive national attention...and all this at such a young age.I first sampled her style at The Fifth Floor. Each course was a masterpiece. Now, in the Castro, she has a beautiful, simple and elegant space that exudes class and quality. (Keep in mind, this is not The Fifth Floor and it is certainly not as stuffy). In this space, what I liked most about Frances, is the fact that one can dine with one of the best local chefs and know that it will not cost a whole paycheck.As for the food, there really is no reason for me to go into any detail. We chose alot of food and I was not disappointed...each and every course was absolutely delicious. Her food is prepared with knowledge and care and expertly presented and created. Typically her choices are farm-to-table so you know that Ms. Perello really does take each and every ingredient into consideration.Service was excellent throughout our entire meal. My one and only recommendation would be to take out just one table...quarters are very tight in this little neighborhood restaurant. With that said, I have already made reservations for future visits. I am confident that if you have read this far, you will sincerely enjoy the ambiance and cuisine of Chef Perello and Frances.', 'Delightful!! If you don read another word of my musings, take that home with you.Out of the way and unpretentious, this tiny space heaps on one surprise after another in hospitality, comfort, & cuisine. From the moment we arrived until the waiter chased me 2 blocks down the street to return my forgotten hat, the service was nothing less than impeccable. While we had one waiter who was responsible for our table, every member of the staff stopped by at one point or another to make sure that we had everything we wanted exactly when we wanted it. The room was beautifully and simply appointed, highlighting the wine and architectural details of the space. My only complaint is that the tables are crowded together closely, so private conversation at most tables is not really possible. My husband and I enjoyed the beignets and calamari appetizers followed by the cod and slow roasted beef entrees. All were extremely well done, but the beignets stood out as the never had them anywhere like this favorite of the evening. Whatever you choose, don miss those. The wine list seemed accessible and broad at first blush (pun intended). They serve a custom blend house wine for $1/oz. I couldn resist trying the red and I enjoyed a glass of it. Its a bit bright and acidic to sip on through the whole meal, but it was completely fun and easy (not to mention reasonably priced) to start. I had their Cab by the glass with the beef which was also a nice choice. All of the foodies in this village know about Melissa Perello and her incredible career to date, so come check this place out before they start spilling over from Noe Valley, the Marina, and Pacific Heights. Remember that there is almost no parking in this quaint RESIDENTIAL block of the Castro, so the 1.5 block walk from the Castro Street Muni station is far easier on the environment and your nerves than navigating by car. The first time you come here you will feel like the ultimate insider who discovered some tiny gem in a dark corner of the City. Based on the service we received tonight, when you return a second time you will feel like Family.', Three cheers for Frances!!! My wife is gluten-free and we often have a difficult time finding places to dine out that can accommodate her diet. Frances hit the bulls-eye. While we were a bit bummed out that we could not indulge in the beignets, we did have the grilled calamari and the squash frites, which were both delightful. We also had the chestnut soup, a creamy and a welcome delight given the chilly weather recently. I had the slow roasted beef which could have been cut with a butter knife and my wife had the cod which she said was cooked to perfection. Now if only they would make a gluten-free desert, we'd never want to leave. And the house wine at a mere buck on ounce is one of the best deals around.The only reason for the four stars and not the five is that we were seated by the door, which was naked to the elements. BBBBRRRRRR. Just too dang nippy. I highly suggest to the management to invest in a door curtain. It would make a world of difference., 'What a cute neighborhood restaurant! It still working out the new restaurant kinks though. I like its atmosphere, a modern vibe with down to earth service, just the right low lighting, and clean interior design. The restaurant timing, however, is a challenge. We had 8:30 reservations on a Friday night, and were not seated until just after 9pm. After we ordered, it took a 1/2 hour for our appetizer to come, at which point, we were extremely hungry! On the food, the duck liver mousse appetizer had a smooth consistency and a delicious meaty texture, balanced just right with a small side of pickled greens. The slow cooked beef was a disappointment - it was overcooked and lacked flavor. The Cod was done well and I liked how seasonal ingredients were incorporated into this dish. We tried the chocolate tart dessert, which had exactly the rich flavor that I like in any chocolate!The wine list has a good selection of Californian and International wines by the bottle and glass, and I think there something for everyone here. Overall, I think this restaurant is great as a neighborhood place to go, but I wouldn make it a dining destination.', I'm happy I got to check Frances out early in the game because I think that it will only get better from here. We arrived about 15 mins early, grabbed a couple glasses of wine and were seated promptly at our reservation time. The host was extremely welcoming and warm - I was a big fan of him. Another thumbs up has to be given for Jim, who helped us with our wine selection (he steered us away from a too-sweet bottle that I almost ordered so thank you, Jim!) He very well might have been my favorite part of the evening. He was friendly and approachable - which is a nice change compared to a lot of other dining experiences when wine is a point of discussion. Albondigas were pretty good - 4 came in a bouchee order so we each had 2, which I thought was just fine. I think my favorite part of them might have been the salsa verde though. I would've liked a dish of that for dipping my bread. Speaking of bread, they serve Acme and it's slightly warmed when you receive it. My only complaint is that it's rather fussy the way they serve it. Someone comes around with the bread sliced on a tray and they give you one slice with some tongs. Why can't they just give you a little basket with 2 slices per person? For my entree I had the slow roasted beef and I'm really glad I went with that. The dish was hearty and just perfect for the freezing cold, rainy weather. I particularly liked the creamed greens (I think it was mostly kale). The potatoes were also perfectly creamy and buttery. All in all, it was a spot-on feel-good dish.The bean ragout I got on the side was fine, nothing to write home about. My friend's lardo wrapped cod was good, but nowhere near as good as the beef in my opinion. Our server was a little flighty but I let it go because I enjoyed the overall experience since Jim and the host were so nice. I was trying to explain to our server that I had originally wanted to order a bottle of wine but that we got 2 glasses and he was kind of rude about it. I think he pretended not to understand what I was talking about so he could brush me off. Lastly, our plates came out less than hot, which was the only slight food disappointment. The table next to us actually sent their plates back and we spoke to them about it briefly because we kind of wanted to do the same thing. Don't get me wrong - the food was good - it just would've been better if it wasn't served just barely warm. In fact, when we got our beans, some of them were almost cold until you gave the ragout a good stir. They're clearly still working out kinks but I think Frances is a great spot. The space is beautiful and inviting and I will definitely be back., Magician? Exorcist? Chef Melissa Perello manages to raise the bar on the Castro restaurant scene while chasing the poltergeist from this formerly cursed location. Well done. Had my birthday dinner here and left feeling absolutely spoiled by the excellent service and the fit-for-a-king food. Lardo wrapped cod and bacon beignets...it's as if the chef was reading this bacon lover's mind. Excellent wine recommended by our server went so well with each of our courses. Can't wait to return., 'The sure sign of a very good evening is that I can keep myself from repeatedly exclaiming, I like this place! Well, I really liked this place!** Grits - If you are a fan of Anson Mills grits...then this will be the best $6 you ever spent. Served straight-up, as a side dish, you can mix and match with your other dishes. Awesome! Try the grits with the creamed greens, also on the side.** House made filtered sparkling water - yummy. Why don I see this more places? ** Bacon beignets with chive creme fraiche - Ours were impeccable...but you need to make sure you get them as soon as they come out. Our table neighbors didn get theirs ASAP and they lost something in those few minutes before they got to the table. ** Albondigas con Salsa Verde - tender and subtle. woah!** Chestnut soup - not too sweet, creamy...also subtle. It so nice to have a dish that got complex flavor but doesn whack you over the head with it. Very tastfully garnished with greens, pancetta and cipollini onions.They say the menu changes. The menu on the night we were there was substantially like the sample menu that posted online. Didn get to try the desserts, but will do so next time. The house red was tasty, drinkable, a pretty good deal too at $1/ounce. The warm rosemary sage almonds we were served shortly after being seated were a really nice, savory touch.The service was great from my vantage point (we had a great server), but heard some others grumbling (in the small space it hard to miss it). I think they may be trying to create a relaxed, unrushed atmosphere...so if you like to get your meal going kind of quickly...you need to say something.', Without a doubt, the food here is terrific. But the overall dining experience does not go with the prices charged.The tables are simply too close together. It's impossible to have an intimate conversation. And packing in so many people results in extremely slow service, since the kitchen clearly can't handle the number of diners squeezed in to this place.While the wait staff is fairly professional, not once did anyone come to refill our wine glasses (something which should be expected at this price point).If they cut down on the number of seats (at tiny tables!), they would create a better dining experience, it would speed up the service, and presumably the tables would turn more quickly...a benefit to the restaurant.So I recommend the restaurant for its food, but not for the overall experience. There are other places in this neighborhood that fill this niche more successfully, such as the great bistro L'Ardoise on Noe., 'SOLID BABY!Amazing:valrhona cake `73 madeiraVery good:yam fries with meyer lemonalbondigaschicken w/fennel and nectarineMediocre:cod with boccalone lardo bacon beignets with creme fraicheNow for some random facts:-Seating was tight, especially at the bar.-The house wine is $1 per ounce. They give you a beaker full and see how much is gone at the end of dinner. They charge you for the amount you drank. (This would never work in Russia. Somebody would pour water in there to make it look full again.)-The coffee pots are gorgeous glass carafes with wood and leather.-The location is that of the former Hawaiian restaurant.', Though I still miss the Hawaiian food that used to be served at Tita's in this same space years ago, I was lured back to this new neighborhood restaurant by all the good buzz and reviews here. The new owners have really transformed the space and have made the best out of a very narrow dining area.We started with beignets - which were tasty, but not memorable. The chestnut soup was tasty - with the sweetness of the cipollini onions blending well with the savory broth. Gnocchi with duck confit were perfectly chewy, but I wish there were more than 7 small morsels.Stuffed chicken medallions were succulent and juicy but my boyfriend commented that he felt he had cooked almost the same thing at home. The cod was overcooked and lacked flavor, despite the lardo wrap. It was also served lukewarm - it was a full house and I would guess that the servers/kitchen are still finding their rhythm.All in all, a pretty good experience, but for $106, incl. tax, tip and 12oz of house wine (at $1/oz), I expected a bit more., 'Very buzz-worthy based on the food alone...however the service put Frances over the top for me. This would have been a five star review save for one thing, well, two things.1. The tight seating - If I wanted to eat while sitting in the lap of a perfect stranger I would, well, shit, never mind, why on earth would I want to do that? Anytime I forced into a spot where the people breath at the next table is a more prevalent smell than that coming from the food sitting in front of me we have a problem. This seating issue leads me to the second thing and that thing is...2. Noise. Granted it a small space, and it a given that a restaurant (especially in these dire, end-of-the-world, financial times...) will always want to maximize the space/profit equation, but damn! I mean, of course squeezing that many sheep into the chute is not only going to cause a cluster-fuck of terror, but also a symphony of cackling and screeching not heard since the San Francisco Symphony teamed up with Metallica in the late 1990. The dinner din up in here felt like an easy 120 dB. It was like having a nice, quite meal inside a jet engine.Now, setting these two things aside, I have to say, the meal itself was purely perfect. The chestnut soup, divine. The slow roasted beef, sublime. The wine pairings with our desserts were spot on and the good humor of our server was much appreciated. Il be back for sure, only next time I bringing earplugs...', This is a difficult review to write. We had a terrific dinner out...everything was very, very good but there was one undeniable flaw. I'll get to that in a moment. First the food.Well, actually the wine. We ordered a carafe of the house red. If you've read the other reviews here, you'll note the drinkability. Light, fruity and round the wine is very good and very reasonable. The menu was delivered. It's broken down into four categories: bouchees, appetizers, entrees and sides. From the bouchees menu we ordered Frites (Mariquits Garnet Yams, Meyer Lemon and Sauce Piquant) and 'Albondigas con Salsa Verde' (lamb, pork, kale and moorish spice blend). The Frites were sweet potato fries. Delicious though perhaps a bit too limp. I prefer them at the re-opened Limon. Good nonetheless. The Albondigas were meatballs. Very tender. The salsa was perhaps a bit bland but I'm very picky on this. They were delicious. From the appetizer menu I ordered the Chestnut Soup (Roasted Cippollini and house cured pancetta). The soup was very good. The pancetta was ungodly good. The onions were sweet. Excellent soup.From the entree menu we ordered the Slow Roasted Beef (with creamed winter greens and potato puree). We also ordered the Soul Food Farm Pasture Raised Chicken (with roasted fennel, nectarine Agrodolce). Both entrees were outstanding. The chicken was cooked perfectly. The beef likewise. Tender, flavorful. The potatoes were beautifully pureed...they still had a good starch consistency and weren't too watery. Great dinner.Now the down side. We waited a solid hour before any food arrived at the table. Our carafe of wine was long gone and we had to drive so there would be no wine with dinner. Twenty minutes after appetizers, our entrees arrived. I was past being hungry. I couldn't eat even half my entree. Despite being offered free desserts I couldn't find the interest. There were plenty of waiters on the floor. (When they walked by most of the time their eyes were averted. They knew the customers were waiting far, far too long and there was nothing they could do about it.) The kitchen, though preparing delicious food, really needs to get it's act together. In a place that serves roughly fifty or so diners, any professional kitchen in SF should be able to scale to serve dinner.So, there it is. Parking is hit or miss. Ambiance is fine. Tables are close together but I'm OK with it. Location is good...close to everything but not on top of everything. If the kitchen ever gets it's act together (and I have no reason to think it won't) this place will be a go-to joint. 3 stars., 'A high-end casual restaurant in the Castro with a real foodie pedigree, you say?! It like a unicorn has landed.Yes, Frances really is that good, and I was very impressed with both food and service at my dinner there last week--barely a week after they opened. Pretty much everything we ordered ranged from decent to really quite good. The amuses are worth starting off with, and the chestnut soup we had was delicious on a cold night. My fish wrapped in an uncured prosciutto was delicious over some squash puree; my friend steak was a little dry but incredibly flavorful. The chocolate cake was rich, blissful heaven.Their metered, pour-it-yourself, pay-by-the-ounce wine service is a far more clever (and appropriate) approach to casual wine service than what other restaurants in this segment are doing. (Flour + Water, can you hear me?) My friend and I opted for a full bottle instead, and our server recommended a tasty Barbera that didn disappoint.I pleased to see some more high-end (without being ridiculously overpriced) places coming into the Castro neighborhood. Hopefully Frances will continue to make it work!', My favorite opening of 2009. Service was great, the ambiance was pleasant and best of all the food was delicious.The gnocchi with duck confit is a must order. With a short menu (4 apps, 4 entrees) you had better deliver - there is nowhere for clunkers to hide. Thankfully everything we tried was excellent.I highly recommend Frances but would only go with a reservation. The area in the front can be a mob scene and doesn't look like a pleasant place to eat., I get a kick out of blowhards like 1-star Jose whose boyfriend thinks he's capable of making the same chicken dish that's served at Frances. Unless el novio has worked in a solid kitchen or graduated from CIA or CCA I sincerely doubt he's capable of the prep and skill involved in what appears to be so simple.That said, Castro-ites can rejoice in the fact that there are finally two food-first, chef-driven restaurants now. Frances and Starbelly. Next someone needs to go into the 'pretend' dining restaurants like 2223, Catch and Eureka Grill and gut them and start from scratch.As for the food at Frances, some huge hits and a couple of minor misses. The smoked bacon beignets were a let-down. Very doughy, more like fritters, but the sweet potato fries were the best we've ever tasted bar none. The semolina gnocchi with the duck confit were superb and I thought that the serving was ample in spite of 1-star Jose's desire for Cheesecake Factory portions.The skatewing was delicious BUT, I've never had it served on the bone. The brussel sprouts and celery root puree on the dish were perfect compliments to the fish and brown butter (a very traditional way to serve skate.) The dish would be 5-star sans the bones. The chicken was succulent and really, really tasty, too.So, go Castro-ites! Support your new foodie restaurants., I've been to Frances three times in its young month-open life and I am thrilled to have it in the Castro. Melissa Perello has made a warm and inviting atmosphere with lovely staff and amazing food. I went recently with a former chef and we were both delighted by the fantastic flavors and perfect amount of attention from the staff. We started off with the yam frites and beignets which were fantastic, and then I had the slow roasted beef (and I'm not much of a carnivore) which was incredible. Worth every penny. I plan on visiting often and taking all my out of town guests for a real treat. Reservations are encouraged for a great experience., This place may finally break the curse of its corner location. There have been Hawaiian, Filipino, Italian and other restaurants at this location and none has lasted.With her reputation and experience at restaurants like Fifth Floor Melissa Perello has the ability to draw people to this hidden corner and the food is good enough to make people come back.There is a big caveat: this is not a place for a vegetarian or even a psecatarian. Dishes like the chestnut and fennel soup that seem vegetarian at first glance have chicken stock in them and come with crudo of lard. The only fish entree comes with chorizo sausage. They are willing to remove the meat portions when they can but it changes the taste and composition of the dish.That said the sole vegetarian entree that we had, lacinato kale and crepe cannelloni was wonderful, each bite burst with the rich flavour and texture of the mushroom, leek and kale filling and it swam in a shallow bath of butter.The roasted chestnut and fennel soup was amazing with fennel being prominent but not overpowering and the fat of the la Quercia Lardo ie. thin layers of seasoned lard on toasted bread adding a richness to a wonderful soup. The soup is large and quite filling.There are only four entrees and we tried the low roasted beef with creamed winter greens and potato puree. The puree was mashed potatoes and had almost no taste. The greens however were great and I could have had double the serving. The roast beef was super tender and moist but it could have used more seasoning and infusions. It was a very home style and comforting dishes and perfect on the day after Christmas.We were far too stuffed to try the dessert although they looked good with ice cream from Humphrey Slocombe that wonderfully pretentious but delicious ice cream maker. They also serve blue bottle coffee.The service was amazing worthy of Michelin restaurant. There was team of about six people for the small places and everyone had been trained in great table service.We managed to get the only non reserved table in the dining room on a Sunday night so reservations are recommended. The table are insanely close together and you can't get in or out without physically moving your table. Be prepared to hear the conversation at the tables next you. We had some sweet older gay boys next to us and ended up having a lovely conversation but this not a place with lots of elbow room or privacy.Price wise this is in the fancy date/upper middle class professional range with the entrees between 17-23 and the appetizers between 6-12., 'Frances is a perfect fit in our beautiful city.The food here is amazing and well executed. We started with the perfectly cooked mixed meat meatballs with spices. They were great but you have to ask for bread at Frances, it took some time to bring us some, so we can soak up the juices and spices. Then we tried the Gnocchi with Duck confit, this was the best Gnocchi I have ever tasted in the city, it was incredible. Then for entrees we tried the skate which was perfectly cooked and perfect with chorizo bits on it, also the chicken dish was so tender and perfectly cooked it came cut in medallions with this bread salad that was like Xmas stuffing. Yum. For dessert we had the chocolate tart with Humphrey Slocombe olive oil ice-cream. It was as good as the rest of the meal.The atmosphere is cozy and intimate although most of the tables are uncomfortably close to one another (we were lucky to be seated at one of the two tables that have a bit more privacy). The service was good but a little slow at times, which I can definitely forgive since the food is totally worth the wait.', I went last Wednesday night for dinner. The food was fantastic, but the service was somewhat appalling. There was a huge delay between our appetizers and entrees. No one came to check on us. Following dinner, we again were left for an eternity before ordering dessert and when that was done we had to send out scouts to get our check. For a small place, it's surprising we could feel so forgotten about. I want to like this place - the Castro really needs a restaurant like this and I thought the food was great, but not if service is this dismal..., 'Finally a great restaurant in the Castro!', 'Excellent food - five stars - not too expensive compared to other restaurants in SF. Only drawback is the restaurant is very small and a bit too crowded. They put too many tables close together.', I've eaten here twice in the last two weeks and have to say the food and ambiance is excellent, maybe better than excellent. the chick pea fritters and the albondigas as starters are out of this world. I had a chickory salad last night and it was so beautiful, you could frame a photo of it. the slow cooked beef with pureed potatoes is so good, no one could do it better. The feeling of the decor is clean, classic, and comfortable...not trying to be more than it is. It is really about the food.The two negatives (maybe 3) are that the tables are too close together, the wait can be long (both times I had a reservation and was seated half hour later) and some of the staf have a bit of attitude...just a bit. Oh, one mor positive...it has a VERY attractive bathroom., We strolled in around 530 pm on new year's eve without a reservation and managed to get two seats at the bar (they were completely booked and the restaurant was packed by 615).No problem though, the waiter removed one of the chairs so we would have a little more elbow room and the experience only got better from there. Our drinks arrived a few moments later, we ordered the house wine, a Syrah blend, which was very good.We started with the chickpea fries with meyer lemon aioli and then moved onto the gnocchi with duck and braised greens. That was one of the best little gnocchi dishes I've ever had. For entree's, my gf had the Kale Crepe Cannelloni with mushrooms, leeks and Lo Tur cheese. She loved it, which was good, as it was the only veggie entree on the menu. She had creamed winter greens as a side. I had the chicken breast, which was stuffed with more chicken served over savory bread pudding w/raisins and apples. It had amazing flavor and was cooked perfectly.We did manage to have a little space for dessert and coffee (Blue Bottle). We shared the Valrhona choc ganache with olive oil ice cream (from Humphrey Slocombe) and I wish I had a bigger stomach so I could've had more. The service was great from start to finish. It's nice to have a restaurant of this caliber in our hood. (It's small and a little noisy when it's packed, but reminded us of so many little restaurants we've been to in Europe.) We'll definitely go back.Happy New Year!, Two words: BACON BEIGNETS!!!!! Sigh. Two well-loved foods...in one! Pure genius.The duck gnocchi is quite good but surprisingly the best dish hands down was the chicken entree. It's like rediscovering an old boyfriend that you'd given up on., i came here with some friends for NYE dinner, it was simply one of the best dining experiences i've ever had. right from the start, the host had a warm smile on his face. the food was delicious .. we had the chickpea fritters (amazing!), beet salad (so good), dungeness crab salad (delectable), and the vegetarian dish (forgot what it was called but it was very tasty). the service was excellent, from the waiter to all the different people who came by to refill our water. we also ordered a bottle of wine which was really good (il bastardo, or something similiar) and it was only about $20 (score!). upon leaving the restaurant, the host once again had a warm friendly smile on his face and wished us a happy new year. thanks, Frances, for making our NYE so special., 'This place is amazing. The food is incredible, with rich textures and varied tastes to suit everyone. Four of us diners had several of the appetizers and two different entrees, and one dessert. The Bacon Beignets were out of this world. Dipped in the chive creme fresh, the taste was very much like a fluffy baked potato. The gnocchi with duck comfit was by far the best first bite each of us had - the greens, duck, and fluffy gnocchi were a symphony. The crab salad was probably the most disappointing flavor-wise but it was okay. In the middle was the chicken liver mousse. The grilled bread had a smoky flavor that imparted the fluffy mousse with richness. Amazing. We had the slow-roasted beef and the chicken with savory bread pudding. Both were equally fantastic. I hate greens and I ate every single piece on my plate - they were THAT good. The beef was melt-in-your-mouth good, no need for knives with that yummy meat. My friend had the chicken, which was juicy, flavorful, and delish! The bread pudding reminded me of crunchy, stuffing. YUM! One of our crew had the hot buttered Madeira which was simply genius. We shared our personal wine (brought from home, $15 corkage fee) with Paul, the sommelier, and he told us what was in the Madeira - not on anyone diet for sure but totally amazing. I shared the buttermilk panna cotta with shortbread cookies. The citrus topping was a little TOO much - literally, there was probably too much of it. A little less and the sweetness would not have overpowered the rich creaminess of the buttermilk - which was a dream. The cookies were a nice, light (although again, a little too sweet) touch to the overall flavor. On the down side, the place is crowded and reservations are recommended. However, I had no problem making them the day of our dinner, for 7pm on a Saturday. The walkways are narrow and people are constantly pushing past each other, including the waiters. The parking is, as always in the Castro, a pain in the butt but it worth the search for a place to park just to get here. Really. However, the food outshone all those issues and gave our dinner party much to talk about all the way home. I highly recommend Francis - it IS a gem!', Overall, an enjoyable experience.Started with the applewood smoked bacon beignets which were really tasty. Next the dungeness crab salad which was lightly dressed and included a good amount of crab... yummy but a little oversalted. Last, the skate over brussels sprouts... fish was light and tasty, but the brussels were way oversalted. And, I think I have a good tolerance for salt.The space has been nicely done and is surprisingly not as noisy as you'd expect. The restaurant has a large staff, but there seemed to be confusion/delay in determining who had our table., Albondigas...fun to say and better to eat; especially when done as well as they were at Frances. As fans of Melissa and her staff, my gf and I were excited to try her permanent new spot. Along with the albondigas, the chicories salad was unique and tasty - a combination of in-season persimmons, almonds, and tangy pecorino. Ingredients were local and superbly-prepared. Though done well, my gripe is that the menu was limited, particularly the entrees. The chicken entree was good and simple, but was still chicken. My gf had the crusted cod and though good, I thought it a bit bland.If possible, I would give Frances 3.5 stars- definitely a restaurant worth trying and likely to improve as the menu grows and catches up with Melissa's culinary skills. The waitstaff and sommelier were fantastic. Tables are tight and expect to make friends with your neighbors; don't plan on having a private conversation..., 'The chess world had everyone looking for Bobby Fisher; and the food world had us looking for Melissa Perello after her stint in a restaurant located in a hotel pressing the 5 button in the elevator. She appears here! I don know how my wife found her, but she did and I glad she did. We had my birthday dinner here. Chef Melissa hasn lost her touch. Everything we had was tasty - chicken liver mousse (fluffy and smooth), steamed clams (mild garlic soup was yummy), slow roasted beef (it was really lean and tender); and the gnocchi (tender duck confit). The Valrhona ganache tart with olive oil ice cream was rich and the hidden candied citrus was a fresh surprise. For the wine: 06 Pinot Domaine Emile Juillott It was light, taste of berries and had a nice nose. The Blue bottle coffee served via Comex should be ordered a dish before one plans on eatting dessert. The coffee turned up after we had our dessert.The seating is tight, acoustics loud; and youl need some patience finding parking. We had the early seating, but by the time we finished our dinner, the line was out the door. Reservations highly recommended. A definite go back place. It very homey, service timely and food delicious. It great to see Chef Melissa.', Frances is a hidden Noe Valley/Castro gem. After an evening at the movies, our party of 4 dined at Frances on a rainy Saturday evening. Even before I walked through the doors, I had a great impression of this place.. mainly because they were able to squeeze us in for a last minute reservation! Dining at Frances is an intimate experience. The tables are close together so you can't help but look over and assess your neighbor's choice of appetizers/entrees. A friend and I ordered the slow roasted beef and the rest of our party ordered the soul food chicken and kale. Reading the description of the beef had my mouth watering even before it arrived! I LOVED my dish! The beef was very tender and cooked to perfection. The greens and potato puree were an excellent addition to the dish and complemented the slow-roasted beef very well. I was so enamored with my dish that I forgot to ask my other friends how their dishes were... I imagine they enjoyed their meal as well given the clean plates and happy full stomachs.Generally I struggle to finish my meal given the small size of my stomach; however, I finished every last bite. A cup of Blue Bottle (yes, they serve Blue Bottle) was essential to wake me up from my food coma. I highly recommend Frances!, I'm always happy to see good serious food restaurants open in the Castro, and this is about as good as it gets for serious food. The duck liver mousse appetiser was so good I wanted to slather it all over my body and lick it off, but I didn't want to cause a scene. My rolled stuffed chicken breast on a bed of fennel entree was also delicious, but it looked a bit lonely on the plate. What I could see on others' plates around me also looked excellent.'The drawbacks for me relate more to the physical space, not the menu or its execution. Being a small space causes the tables to be crammed together (which I dislike), and even the counter space is very cramped. Also, the counter seats are near the coffee bar area, and the constant banging from emptying the espresso strainers was really working my last nerve. Service, however, was friendly, professional, and efficient.I will definitely go back again, with one or two more people, and experience more of the great menu while seated at a table., Fabulous! Went here with a friend recently and was thoroughly impressed with the service and the food. The space is quite small however it gives it a warm, lively ambiance. Highlights: - Semmolina gnocchi with duck confit. Do not miss this. - Yam frites.  - lacinito kale and crepe canneloni with mushrooms. Even my carnivore friend loved them - the house wine. good value for money. - the service. Our table wasn't ready when we arrived and I asked the waiter if we could have some bread while we waited. He brought us two bacon beignets instead!Room for improvement - cod with squash, brussels, and apple. the veggies were nice, the cod was cod. nothing special. I found myself longingly eyeing my neighbor's slow roasted beef. - noise. there's nothing to absorb the sound in this cozy place.Definitely one of the gems of the neighborhood., 'Our first visit to Frances last evening. Patrick is unbelievable as is the rest of the staff, Joe and Graham and others. They have not left out anything in the service department. The food is incredible, the albondigas, the beinets and the chicken!! Eclectic wine list and all at reasonable prices. Get a reservation early, Frances is hitting all the right notes! What a neighborhood gem!!Thank you Chef!!', 'I moved from Seattle, where there is a slew of female run restaurants turning out sensuous food.My sig other and I visited Frances on the first week of opening....usually a time fraught with mistakes and stumbles, but Frances pushed through (aside from being a bit chilly;)Ordered the house wine in the graduated cylinder carafe and dove right into the menu. I am a lover of all things fried and the beignets with bacon were no different. Crispy and doughy, with a kiss of salt from the bacon....Great!I also adore french inspired chestnut soups so we ordered the Frances version.....creamy and silky with a balance of sour from the creme fraiche.My mind is failing me in my tender 26th year, but I recall a fish entree, wrapped in lardo....after my lardo pizza disaster at Beretta I was nervous, but as I hoped the lardo in this instance merely served to impart the perfect amount of fat to the fish, keeping it tender and moist. Bravo!Finished with the chocolate terrine and the only complaint is why there was not more.After one night at Frances, it already climbed and catapulted over many of my other SF favs.France is making its way onto my ready rotation for dinners out, when I not cooking magic at home.', every gay person ever: chris, why did you move out of the castro?me: bc the food in the castro is god awful!well not anymore! frances is AMAZING! waiter: i think we only have one more market shotme: only one?waiter: yea i should go check to see if it's still therechrisn: RUN!!!!!Winter 2010 menuthis restaurant specializes in local foods. you know how much i love that! they also have really friendly wait staff. they also have cloth towels in the bathroom.bacon beignets are goodballs of lamb are amazingthe steelhead tasted like bacon and the brussel sprouts put mine to shamethe chicken was MOIST and yummy and the savory bread pudding was to die forthe steak was so good and the grits made me cumin summary, great food and they're green. i'm hard just thinking about it.if you wonder what it takes to get 5 stars from me, go to frances., 'went here the first week it opened and i have to say it was pretty darn good. we started out with the agave wine and fruit juice shots which were wonderful and first discovered Once the table cab sauv wine here which is great for the price. we also had the bacon beignets, albondigas, gnocchi, short ribs....just to name a few. all were delicious. the desserts we had were just ok but i sure they have gotten better. my only complaint has to be that i made a reservation and arrived right on time only to watch the manager give our table to what looked like his friends that had just walked in. we ended up waiting 45min to an hour for another table to open up. which wasn too bad since we were comped a few appetizers, a drink, and perhaps dessert. this definitely made up for the long wait. i just wish i hadn arrived to see it all happen.....all in all i definitely coming back here and thought the food was divine.', Here's the deal --- Transcendent. I used that word with the waiter tonight. I never use that word. Unless I'm talking about early Van Halen.We had:Bouchees: Bacon Beignets and BeetsAppetizers: Crab and Frisee saladsEntrees: Soul Food Chicken and Slow Cooked BeefDesserts: Lumberjack Cake and Chocolate TartAll was fantastic. As was the house red.I haven't had a meal this good anywhere in SF in 5 years. Seriously. I have plenty of great 5-star meals here, but nothing - NOTHING - like this.The beef will keep me up at night for days and I will spend thousands trying to recreate it at home...most likely to fail....If we had a quibble at all (and we don't) it would be that It would have been nice to have a taste of something sweet - maple syrup maybe? - in the creme fraiche with the beignets.But I have no other words. Just go there. Now., What a wonderful addition to the hood. A solid 4 1/2 startsThis is definitely a must visit restaurant in the city.The host was a delight and the food was scrumptious. We were an early walk in and sat at the bar. We had:Semolina gnocchi with duck confit: very good and quite filling ( not sure if I would order next time). The meatballs: a must order the sauce alone is divineSoul food chicken: Oh my god I think I ate my days calories with this one, worth every sinful biteLumberjack cake: just do yourself a favor and get it. My man who is not a desert fan loved every yummy morsel.The house wine $1 per ounce is reason to visit alone, a lovely red wine for a bargain.I'm so happy Frances has moved in. We love you!, Went on Sunday and had the best time. The food is great. I'm going again on thursday. It's nice to have a chic place to eat in the Castro., A new restaurant in my neighborhood getting good reviews I had to stop in. Popped in last night and and I was able to grab a seat at the bar. The wait staff was very pleasant and accommodating but I must say the bar area is packed pretty tightly. I felt like I was sandwiched in. After reviewing the menu I opted for the steak. The flavor was OK but just OK and the portion was quite small. At $23 they could had either priced it lower or made the portion a bit larger. I don't need a half of a cow but had I known it was going to be that small I probably would have also had a starter course. Anyway all in all it was alright but I must say I was expecting it to be much better. Since it's in my neighborhood I will definitely give them another shot but for now I can only give three stars., 'Dinner at Frances on a Friday evening. Difficult street parking, but we found a spot three blocks away.Charming cozy neighborhood restaurant, love the series of black and white pictures on the wall.Got the nice window table. We ordered the bacon beignets and the cakamari with persimmons, they are called  bouchees, so they were smaller than the appetizers. The crab salad was delightful. The bavette steak was average, but we loved the roulade of chicken!! It was cooked sous vide, moist and tender, then browned lightly. The black cod was delicious also, with artichokes hearts. Portions were a bit smaller than most other restaurants.For desserts we shared a panna cotta and a lumberjack cake with Humphrey Slowcombe ice cream. Finished every single crumb of it!!Service was very friendly, but a bit disorganized. Different people served the food and bread, so we were missing silverware and had to ask twice.Nice wine list. The place was vibrantly full the whole time we were there. Definitely a great hot spot for the neighborhood.', 'YES! Frances is awesome. I went here last night and it is definitely the best restaurant in the Castro.-Tables are cramped. Sit at the bar - you can go here with more than 2 people anyways, and the bar actually affords you MORE space and privacy and you can also get a seat without a reservation.-Chickpea fries were amazing: little 2x4s of mashed chickpeas that had the consistency of creme brulee inside, breaded and fried. I had these at a tom douglas joint in seattle like 5 years ago but frances made them better times 10.-I usually avoid ordering chicken in restaurants (except zuni) but I had to try it here and was not disappointed.-lumberjack cake was a great winter dessert: spicy, nutty, warm, melty... mmm.-the only knock i would give is that the host insisted we wait 10 minutes for him to figure out how long the wait was, only to tell us that it would be another 45 minutes. boo.-Frances is the only restaurant Ie wanted to go to 2 nights in a row...', 'When your menu is similar in style (rustic California/French) to so many others in the city, you better get it exactly right. And Frances is indeed very, very good. Standouts included the duck liver mousse and the slow roasted beef (short rib). Melissa Perello is back, and apparently still bad as hell.', What a wonderful experience. This is a small neighborhood place in the Castro. Start with interesting drink concoctions and move on to the delicious table wine in a carafe priced at $1/oz. Chef/Owner Melissa Perello formerly of Charles Nob Hill and Fifth Floor prepares food using the freshest ingredients sourced from Norther California artisan farmers. Her dishes are remarkably simple yet elegant at the same time. My wife and i dined with another foodie couple and shared many of the dishes to get the broadest spectrum of flavors. From the applewood smoked bacon beignets, to the albondigas each amuse was delicious. We all tried something different for the entree. The chicken was amazing, the beef was also top notch and the scallops were sublime. The desserts were also to die for. The lumberjack cake and the panache paired with a Madeira was wonderful. I can't say how great a place this is especially for the price. If you love great food, you must go., My last meal of the year, my last meal of the decade. Luckily I made reservations ahead of time. If it weren't already highly anticipated enough because of Melissa Perello's first foray on her own, it was New Year's Eve. We were running a bit on the late side, I called to inform them and even after that we waited a good 15-20 minutes. The space is actually not that big; some would call intimate, filled with the booming conversation around us. There's a small bar area to the left of the entrance and exactly one circular table on the opposite side for a group of 4-5 to the right. The dining area lines the long hallway space on the right side and the kitchen with it's small pass/service window adjacent. We were seated pretty tightly in the middle of the main area. The place was packed and it was already starting to show that the service was slammed. They only do wine and wine based cocktails for alcohol so we got a Syrah and one of their specialty drinks the Bitter Orange. Man that Orange drink was addictive. I could have polished many of those things. After perusing the menu we went with:-Applewood Smoked Bacon Beignets w/ Creme Fraiche and Chive-Chestnut Soup - Roasted Cipollini Onions, Pancetta-Semolina Gnocchi - Duck Confit, Braised Cavolo Nero-Slow Roasted Beef - Creamed Winter Greens, Potato Puree-Skate Wing - Brussel Sprouts, ChrorizoThe food was fantastic. Chef Perello lives up to her Aqua and Fifth Floor lineage. The service was a bit slow in between courses and we knew that from the beginning as the kitchen was slammed. The food was five stars but the staffing I think needs to be beefed up if they're going to be packed wall to wall this like all the time. Im definitely looking forward to going back, I just hope the craziness dies down a bit. 4.5 stars, 'Awesome!Great ambiance. Good service. But, hey, fantastic food...why we dine!Bacon Beignets - Perfect...just rolled in some applewood bacon piecesGrilled Calamari salad... so tender, perfectly dressed Golden Beets & Persimmon & Chicories Salad with Almonds ... yum!Chicken and Bread pudding ... watch out Zuni-chicken!!!Butter beans with Porcini Butter ... OMG The best part of our meal!Lumberjack Cake with Humphrey Slocombe Maple-Walnut Ice CreamReasonably priced. Great food. Definitely the best restaurant in the Castro. Absolutely charming.', Came here the first week it opened and I was pleasantly surprised. They were super busy and running behind on reservations which sucks but they were very nice and accommodating. The place isn't very big but we were able to grab two seats at the bar and enjoy some wine while we waiting for our table. The wait staff was refreshingly nice and not arrogant which was fantastic. The ambiance is warm, cozy and fun. Not a ton of room but definitely very cute.As far as the food, we had the beet salad, beignets and gnocchi to start... all were fantastic. I wasn't that hungry so I didnt have a main, but my friend ordered the cod crusted with lardo and it was amazzzing.And the wine is pretty damn good for the pricing and I enjoyed the measurement system.Would def. come back!, Fresh, clean, well-executed dishes in a welcoming, comfortable environment - that's what you're getting at Frances. Chef Perello's inspiration is clearly the farmers market, and her ability to put flavors together without over complicating the plate allows each one of the ingredients she chooses to truly shine. I've written a detailed review of Frances for the SF examiner, which you can read by following the Examiner link in my profile. A very comfortable environment, friendly and attentive service, a great place for a date, meeting with a friend, or even dining alone - I will definitely be back., 'My first yelp review. Amazing ambiance, Extremely fun and lively staff, and mind-blowingly amazing food.'|1
20|grace-chicago-3|Michelin- make room for Chicago's next restaurant. The menu is a perfect blend of land and sea- executed in a way that i have not yet witnessed. The decor is modern and sleek. I loved how you can see the kitchen through the glass wall from the dinning room. Service was spot on and on par with any other high end restaurants in the city. As to the food, I cannot believe for all the hype that I had, this restaurant exceeded it. Curtis Duffy is a winner.  I won't name everything we had, but I had to say, the dinner was like a symphony with never-ending climax. The seared and chilled scallop was fresh and melting in your mouth, so was the salmon. Then it moved on to the meat courses--wagyu beef was probably the best I've had in its class. And just when I thought the next course couldn't possibly surpass the one we just had, here came the veal cheek and I was in heaven. There were three dessert courses, and again, each one came out perfect and exceeding the one before. I really didn't want to leave in the end of dinner. All I want for Christmas now is another dinner at Grace...The best part of the night was to see chef Curtis Duffy working his magic in the kitchen, and he smiled at me!, 'I think Curtis Duffy may be the best chef in Chicago. Wee been looking forward to this ever since Avenues closed, and it did not disappoint. We had dinner here this past Friday 12/14, and everything about it was amazing. I chose the sea menu, my husband chose the vegetable menu, both were lovely and perfect in every way. The salmon was both delicious and amusing, with an oceany foam. The wagu beef dish may be among the most delicious things Ie ever eaten and the veal cheek incredible. My husband couldn stop talking about the maitake mushroom dish, and I could see why since after some cajoling he let me taste it. Chestnuts with truffle were also just lovely. Service was friendly, and a little less formal than Avenues had been, in a modern way that was just right somehow. After our meal, we were given a tour of the kitchen and had the opportunity to meet chef Duffy, who was very gracious to us. I also liked the decor, modern and artistic. All in all, it was a lovely experience. We cannot wait to go back!', 'Food that is the very definition of grace and elegance. Chef Curtis Duffy has hit it out of the park with Grace and I sure it won take long at all before many more people start taking notice. When you walk into the small, intimate dining room you immediately see the pristine kitchen in front of you filled with chefs working quietly and methodically to put each little component of the dishes together to create a work of art. All the staff was incredibly professional, helpful, and you could tell how excited they were to be part of such a fantastic venture.There were 2 menu options, one that is largely vegetarian and one that is more animal protein based. My fiancd9 and I both went with the latter. Every single dish had a fantastic array of textures, making every bite interesting and leaving you wondering what will come in the next. You will definitely find the word delicious used quite a bit! Here what we had: The first few bites weren on the menu but it was one of my favorite courses. Served on a plank of a whisky barrel, each little bite was so interesting had packed with so much flavor and the presentation was very unique*Meyer Lemon-osetra caviar, kumquat jam, chive blossom: Interesting, tasty, the perfect segue into the next course.*Big Eye Tuna-golden trout roe, pomelo, thai basil: Definitely one of the most fun dishes to eat. Served in a container of ice that you break apart and eat all together to give very interesting textures and tastes.*Chilled Scallop-hibiscus tea, five licorice flavored herbs: I usually enjoy my scallops warm but this cold scallop served with a gorgeous pink hibiscus tea sauce left me very satisfied!*Scottish Salmon-crispy red cabbage, citrus pudding, marigold: Oh my goodness, this salmon was unlike any Ie ever tried. So perfectly cooked, I couldn get enough!*Grilled Wagyu Beef-matsutake, salsify, mashua leaf: One of the best few bites of meat Ie ever had, paired with a tea cup filled with dashi to drink as you ate the dish-delicious, perfect, I want more!*Veal Cheek-red wine braised endive, black grape, black mint: Tender, tasty, amazing veal cheeks. Delicious. There isn much more I can say.* Poached Quince-elderflower, tamarind juice, bronze fennel: If the dessert course started and ended here I would be perfectly happy. Perfection.*Caramelized Sudachi-toasted cashews, asian pear, nasturtium: Probably the most beautiful dish we were served-so many colors! The sudachi custard didn quite hit the nail on the head in the flavor and texture department for us, but our plates were still scraped clean when they took them away.*Bitter Chocolate-raw chesnut, persimmon, lemon mint: So many amazing things happening on this little plate. The perfect ending (or so we thought)!They brought us one more course, a bonus dessert, that I don quite remember what it was-except that chocolate was involved and it was a very sweet ending! Before we left we got to go back into the kitchen for a few minutes to watch all the chefs in action. I watched in awe as a chef placed the tiniest of components with such exact precision. That chef then stood up and it was none other than Curtis Duffy himself! I shook his hand and stood awestruck in my own nerdy foodie heaven! We were given a signed menu on our way out, a perfect way to remember this very special night. I sure there are many great things to come for this wonderful new addition to the Chicago.', 'This may have been one of the most anticipated restaurant openings in the past 12 months, but I have walked away unimpressed. You can see hints of the restaurant striving to maintain the allure of the white table cloth dinner from years past. From the formed bamboo wood trim, to the silvery table clothes, this restaurant is pompous. You sit me nearly 20 feet away from the pane of glass that separates the dining room to the kitchen. I saw a lot of white jackets and their faces, but I couldn see what they were doing with their hands. What were they doing with those hands? Were they prepping the food that was coming out? Were they finishing up the plating so that everything would be served together? Or were they wringing their hands at the annoyance at the continuing ant line of tours of the kitchen throughout the night?Oh the mystique of the kitchen tour, bleh. It is note worthy though that we were not asked if our table wanted a tour at the end of the night. We were patted on the back and sent on our way with signed menus. Really. Really? Did that just happen? I don know you Mr. Duffy. I don know your reputation. I simply wanted to have the yummy in my tummy. For the money, for the time, it was not worth it. I wouldn go back, and I wouldn recommend. My food was bland. It was one noted. It was muted. From first course to last, there was no continuity. A record of chasms stuck on repeat. I want to be fed! I want Momofuko sticky buns and cilantro flavored noodles exploding from my mouth! Alas, I would be disappointed. I grant you that I did not expect anything from the beginning. But for the price, for the ambiance that you portray, I walk away hungry.', 'My wife and I were lucky enough to get a table at Grace during its second week. We have eaten at every top restaurant in Chicago and this was easily of one the top five meals wee ever had in this city. The decor of the room was understated and beautiful (be sure to check out the winterthemed bathroom). The service was surprisingly polished for a new opening. Be sure to order one of each of the two tasting menus, as the vegetable menu was outstanding and was even better than the meat dishes on many occasions. The carrot dish and the wagyu were the highlights for me, but what was so impressive was the consistency of the experience. Between the two menus, we had 18 courses plus amuse and I only say two or three were average, each and everyone of the rest were amazing. This restaurant immediately vaults to the top echelon of Chicago (and global) dining, way ahead of L20, Graham Elliot or Tru in my opinion. Enjoy!', Just Go!We were lucky enough to have a party of 4 at dinner service number 9 at the brand new Grace Restaurant, and you would never know that this is a brand new restaurant. Every detail was covered and the service flowed as though delivered by a team who had worked together for years. The staff has the amazing gift to engage each table in the manner that is appropriate for the guest, we wanted to talk and know more about the experience, the food, the staff, the wine, and the co-owner played the part of sommelier for our table and kept us enchanted through the evening. The windows into the kitchen really add a dimension to the experience and it is amazing to see so many people working together as a team, so well orchestrated that barely a word needs to be spoken.The food, well, it really is spectacular. The presentation, the composition, the layers and depth of flavors, all amazing.I strongly suggest getting the wine-pairings for an evening not only exploring amazing foods, but also one experiencing wines that take the whole evening to another level with a new wine to experience with each course.You have a choice of a protein flight or a vegetable oriented flight (not vegetarian, but they'll cover any dietary restrictions). We all went with protein, but I think we'd have been just as stunned with the vegetable as well. (Don't tell anyone, but we had an extra course from the vegetable flight, the carrots, and I'm still thinking about how good it was.)We left full, and happy and amazed. Tremendously expensive, and in my opinion, this is an experience of a lifetime and worth every penny.Go now, before you can't get in. Truly, amazing, special, WOW! GO!, 'In a word, amazing! I have had the good fortune of dining in many of the finest restaurants in Chicago, New York, LA and San Francisco, and Grace ranks right up there with the best. The room is modern and elegant, the service was flawless, and the food was beautiful and delicious. Obviously all of this comes at a high cost, but for a special occasion, Grace should be at the top of the list.', 'My husband and I went for his birthday dinner and loved it! The space is beautiful, the staff was extremely warm, approachable and professional, and the food was delicious and complex. We both left full - we were full about half way through the meal with several courses to go. In order to try the entire menu, I had the Flora tasting and he had the fauna tasting. There were definite stand out courses on both sides - each course was beautifully presented and interesting in taste. We highly recommend Grace for those who enjoy fine dining. We have been to many upscale restaurants locally and while traveling in the US and abroad and this was definitely a stand out experience. Thank you to everyone at Grace for a wonderful evening.', 'I was so blown away from my dinner tonight that I am almost at a loss for words (though I am sure I will find a way to maximize the amount of character Yelp permits, as per usual). This was one of my top all times meals; Grace is such a fitting name for this incredible restaurant and is truly the total package. If I could sum the Grace experience in three words it would be attention to detail. Everything has been meticulously planned and designed to maximize the enjoyment and comfort of the customer. Grace occupies one of the most beautiful spaces I have ever dined at; contemporary, modern, beautiful, elegant and comfortable all come to mind. The luxurious custom made white leather chairs are so comfortable.Tables are spaced far apart to create a quiet, intimate experience. They even built a nice private room for groups of seven to ten to prevent large parties from marring the ambiance of the dining room. Most tables have a view of the semi-open, expansive kitchen. Even the bathrooms are gorgeous; there are four unisex bathrooms each themed to a different season - be sure to check out the winter! The theme of nature carries on to the menu where the finest and freshest ingredients are highlighted and artistically presented; in fact Grace probably has the most beautiful and graceful presentations I have ever witnessed. More importantly, the food tastes as exquisite as it looks. There are two menus, Flora (featuring vegetables) and Fauna (featuring meat and seafood); each is nine courses and costs $185 - this is a venue where vegetarians are not receiving an inferior product, the flora courses do not take a back seat to fauna. As Grace is all about pleasing the customer, you are encouraged to speak up about not just allergies, but also aversions and they will customize dishes to ensure you are eating food you enjoy; you can even mix and match and opt for some items on the flora menu and some from the fauna (as we did). I had by far my favorite vegetarian dish I have ever consumed tonight, a dish titled Carrot also featuring Iranian pistachio, whipped mascarpone and carrot tops. From the fauna side of the menu the Nairagi (a type of marlin) served inside a ginger crystal that you crush and mix the ingredients together was among my favorites as was the A5 grilled Wagyu Beef course with albalone mushrooms, salsify and mashua leaf. Unlike some tasting menus where portions are so dainty that you leave hungry no matter the number of courses at Grace they have carefully designed portions so that even the heartiest of appetites leaves satisfied. Keeping with the attention to detail, there are even bread pairings for four of the courses. Service at Grace is also up there with the best I have ever experienced. The perfect blend of being polished and attentive yet extremely friendly and laid back to boot. The staff is so down to earth and within minutes dissects your personality and adjusts service accordingly. Our servers spent significant time chatting with us and even had us laughing at times, yet still maintained the utmost in professionalism. As examples of how eager they are to please, when my wife (who is a bit of picky eater) found one dessert to sweet for her palate, the server offered to bring her another dish. Later when she really enjoyed the chocolate mignardises, they took note and after our leisurely kitchen tour they surprised us with a take home container with the chocolates. We were really made to feel pampered and special by the amazing staff.Keeping with their mantra of pleasing the customer, Grace permitted us to share the wine pairing (the pairing runs $110) and brought us our own glasses we half sized pour each; the pairings were excellent. Perhaps the only negatives were the desserts (while very good) were not as exquisite as the savories (perhaps a cheese course in lieu of one of the desserts may help balance the savories and sweets). Also our meal lasted just over two hours; shorter than other similarly priced tasting menus we have consumed; while we did not feel rushed, it was such a wonderful experience I wish it would have unfolded at a slightly slower pace. Nevertheless this was a beyond fantastic, memorable experience and I believe Grace will be a strong candidate for three Michelin stars this fall. Bravo on creating a world class restaurant Chef Duffy and thanks to the staff for taking such great care of us; we will be back soon!', 5 Stars for Service4 Stars for Ambience/Dd9cor3 Stars for Food3 Stars for the Wine PairingI wanted to be blown away but left the restaurant underwhelmed and out $425. The service was impeccable. I loved the space. But the real reason I went, the food and wine, I felt were good, not great. I had the Fauna Menu (meat and seafood based) and really enjoyed the Salmon and Wagyu Beef, but didn't fall in love with any of the other dishes. Reading the other reviews I see that some were able to mix the 2 menus; this option wasn't offered to our table. I felt the overall menu and wine pairing were too much on the sweet side and our last 3 dishes were dessert based - I'm not a desert person. I would have liked a more savory menu and I would have skipped the wine pairing option had I known how many sweet wines would be served. I did leave the restaurant full despite opting out of the last 2 dessert courses and enjoyed touring the kitchen. I can also say that the coffee I ordered at the end of the meal is the best coffee I have had. I wouldn't discourage anyone from going to Grace, but it isn't somewhere I would choose to go again., Needing to escape Indiana, my boyfriend and I booked our favorite hotel in Chicago and, as usual, relied on the concierge to choose a dining experience for us. I love the current trend in tasting menu restaurants and was excited to check out Grace.I read the menus beforehand and had some reservations. Flora is vegetarian and Fauna, the meat option, has two dishes that included caviar and roe-not our favorites. Despite the presence of fish eggs, we both chose to opt for the Fauna menu. It was an excellent choice. The dishes were so well balanced that the saltiness of the caviar complimented the creaminess of the custard served with it. With a couple of exceptions-salsify will never be an interesting vegetable-we thought that our meal was exceptional.The same can be said for the service. There is literally an army of staff waiting to serve you and they are all excellent at their jobs. I was particularly impressed toward the end of our meal prior to the dessert courses service. I do not care for dessert and intended to end my meal early, but to my surprise, I was offered two dishes from the Flora menu. While my boyfriend ate his fruits and chocolate, I had a chestnut purree and then the most amazing roasted mushroom soup. As mouthwatering as the meats were, the mushroom course was my favorite of the evening. Fantastic.As delightful as the food was, I thought that the decor was off-putting. BF and I both felt that we were sitting in a corporate conference room. Oddly, when we were first seated, our server ask us if we were content with the table linens or would prefer a darker color. That was a first for both of us and we failed to see how the linens would make much of a difference. I also found it odd that the kitchen is open, but you can't really see what is happening behind the glass. I think that the dining room was meant to be sophisticated, but actually felt rather cold and uninviting.Also, Grace is overpriced. BF chose to go with the wine pairings and was disappointed in several. As much as we enjoyed the food, there were low notes that didn't justify the $850.00 that we spent. For that amount of money, I expected a dining experience beyond my imagining. Grace didn't meet that expectation.I wish there was an option here to give half stars. I would have chosen 3 and 1/2. The food and service were great, but atmosphere and price were not. The bottom line for us is that we will not go back., 'SIGH......Thats how I feel. I was expecting Alinea perfection, but they are not in the same ball park. It was a series of unremarkable courses- I dined there a couple of months ago and I honestly can remember one. I have dined at Alinea a few times and remember most of the courses. Also, at Alinea I am on the edge of my seat , giddy with anticipation for the next course and never want it to end. Grace, don put a bunch of random ingredients together to be different, do it to be delicious. I found the dining room to be elegant, refined and special. The music was silly- one song went on for 10 minutes of random sounds. The service was really great-- they made a great effort. At this price, I won give them a second shot.', Boo-yah! Pow!Just went to Grace on a solo trip tonight. Had the Fauna menu and highlights from the Flora. I actually had seconds on three of the items. The wine pairing was probably the best I've had.The staff was nothing short of amazing. If you want to be left alone, they'll get the hint. If you're looking for educational, friendly, and colloquial, they'll accommodate. Decor and art were primitive cool. Love the 4 seasonal bathrooms. For real?I could go into pedantic details, but that's boring, right?Grace brings it.It's worth your time and money. It's already top 3 in fine dining in Chicago and can only go up from there.The Poached Chestnut, Carrot Top, Veal Cheek, and Caramelized Sudachi might change your life.Look out, Grant. Here comes your boy. Check it ah, ya'll!, Thank you Grace, I had an awesome time.I am so sad that I no longer live across the street from Grace... Had to move right before they open... Boo... So as a Valentine's Day surprise, my boyfriend took me there without hinting to me we would go there. To be honest, it's probably a good thing that I no longer live at 659 W. Randolph or else I would want to go to Grace probably monthly or bimonthly...Grace is the first tasting menu restaurant that I left FULL. I have never left a fine dining Michelin restaurant full before, but I left Grace super full. So - definitely come here HUNGRY!The service was exceptional throughout the whole night. My boyfriend and I actually recognized two of the workers here - one used to work at Ria while the other used to work at Graham Elliott. Chef Curtis is stealing A list workers, one by one :) I actually first heard about Grace when I dined at Charlie Trotter on their 25th Anniversary and was told they would go work at Grace after Charlie Trotter closes, so ever since August 2012 I was excited for Grace to open. :)Thank you Chef Curtis for not making me leave Grace with my stomach 1/2 or 3/4 full. I liked my dining experience and told close friends right away to check out this restaurant. Honestly, I love the people here. They were all very nice. My boyfriend and I got to chat with the chef and he has such a great sense of humor. Good job Chef Curtis - like I said when I was leaving, your 3 Michelin star is on its way., 'Grace is but glory begun, and glory is but grace perfected. -Jonathan EdwardsMy standing rule is to give a new restaurant 6 months to work out the kinks before giving it a try. I glad my husband ignored my rule and booked a table at Grace. Beside the fact that I loved every moment, with all five senses, in another four months, I think you will have to be famous to get a table.A beautiful, understated and elegant space provides a showcase to compliment but never overwhelm the reason restaurants usually exist (the FOOD!). Actually, to call our meal food seems vaguely insulting, it is as if the experience deserves an entirely new vocabulary.The service also stood out with highly informed and appropriately engaged staff following a detailed yet fluid choreography. Unpretentious, smart and accommodating. Attentive and never smothering.If you love food, imagination, pampering and a consistently applied passion for detail, you will find Grace IS glorious perfection.', This place is awesome. Food, service, atmosphere....everything works, and works very very well. I absolutely loved the food and the Thai influences. The service was absolutely impeccable. We we're allowed to go back into the kitchen after our meal which was so interesting to see.This place is everything (and more) that you would expect at a 5-star restaurant in the city. It will be interesting to see where both Grace and Mr. Duffy are at in a year or two. But based on what I saw and ate Friday night, this is only the beginning of a very long and intriguing story.I cannot wait to get back to Grace for another excellent meal., 'What an experience, and it truly was an experience. My husband surprised me with reservations on Saturday night and we loved every minute that we were there.The service is absolutely outstanding. Our waiter and team were more than willing to accommodate our every request. The food spoke for itself. It was innovative without losing focus on the key ingredients themselves. The wine pairings are worth every cent...I highly recommend it. With a heavyweight like Muser behind the helm, I wouldn expect anything less.The decor was modern and yet not distracting.Only minor downfall which results in the loss of a star...the table next to us was a family of five. From what I could understand through conversation the father was a principal investor. Their family was clearly enjoying their dinner, as the father was hammered. The kids laughing, loud talking, and constant moving through the restaurant and kitchen was beyond distracting. I was glad to see them enjoy their dinner but thought it rude that it impacted other diners experiences.', I came to grace after getting a reservation a couple months ago and I was looking forward to it after its raving reviews. The restaurant is very nice, I can say curtis duffy really go into details with the place. In terms of food, the followings are what I had: Amuse bouche Osetra Caviar Nairagi Warm Cucumber Scottish Salmon Grilled Matsusaka Beef Veal Cheek Poached Pear Caramelized Sudachi Dark Chocolate Mignardises - chocolateI would say the food is on the light side, as in terms of flavor. Everything tastes really clean and light since Chef Duffy wants to stay away from butter/cream from his food. Depending on how you like your food, I'm personally more of a bold flavor kind of person and the lightness of the food at times do make me want more flavor. However, it's still a great meal I had there and I would totally go back in the summer when they change their menu., 'I wish there were some sort of 5-star plus rating, to distinguish places like Grace from places where I really like the pad thai, or something like that. The food is interesting and delicious and beautifully presented. Since it changes frequently, I won go into detail, but I will offer some pointers to hopefully help enjoy your experience to the fullest:We had a lovely dining experience, seated in one of the observation tables, overlooking the kitchen. This was awesome for us, but I think some of the other tables offered a more intimate experience. You should def specify what kind of table you want. It is absolutely worth it to have at least one person at the table order the flora menu. When the dishes from each menu were head to head, the flora won out more than once. If you can share, I highly recommend it. If you are a tea lover, this is a place for you. They have an outstanding selection of rare tea from all over the world. Very impressive.. The bread service was delicious! The portions here are pretty reasonable, so between that and the bread, we were stuffed at the end of the meal! Make sure you go hungry!Overall, terrific experience. Wonderful night out. Enjoy!', 'Unbelievable experience. Unforgettable flavors, textures and service.', Came here with my brother and mom for dinner and had a splendid time.With Chef Curtis Duffy at the helm, the food was impeccable. The ingredients were prepared with meticulous care and it showed in each dish. The flavors were beautiful, the presentation was an art form, and the skill of the kitchen staff shined. Between the three of us, we were able to have both the flora, and the fauna and the wine pairing. The meal was seamless and the wonderful service of the waiters only made our experience better. What I loved most about our dining experience was that the food put the diners in such a wonderful mood that we had spent the hours dining, talking and catching up with each other, which is a rare occasion for us since we all live in different parts of the country now. It's a terrific feat I think for a world-class restaurant such as this to put their customers at such ease, without being intimidating. I'd go onto describe the food but it's be like telling you a big spoiler. Just go and expect to have a GREAT time!, The most disappointing dining experience of my life. There's a good incomplete sentence to grab your attention. With all the hype surrounding it's opening, the stellar reviews, the anticipation of the rise of another Michelin star in this city. I was shocked. The experience headed down hill fast very early on in the evening when we were served perfectly excellent osetra caviar drowned in a custard that completely killed the taste of the caviar. The menu stretched out in a long procession of unimpressive dish after unimpressive dish. The wait was sometimes fifteen minutes between courses. Half way through I just wanted to leave. I was bored. When I pay over five hundred dollars for a meal without wine pairings and before gratuity, knowing at that price I can eat almost anywhere in the city, I expect at least one dish I'll never forget. The foie gras and chocolate sorbet at Acadia, the coffee cake with chai tofu ice cream, fried chocolate, and smoked meringue dessert at Trencermen, the caviar dish at 16. Nothing about Grace was memorable except the fact that it was a huge waste of time and money. I think the rest of the Chicago food scene is figuring this out as well, since at 8 pm on a Thursday, a prime dining hour, Grace was half empty. Yes in this case I used the pessimists view...half empty., 'My wife and I visited Grace on a recent Friday evening with great anticipation. Wee frequented most of Chicago top-spots many times before and were long-time regular patrons of Trotter. We were looking forward to Grace with such anticipation that we considered visiting the restaurant well before our reservation time to enjoy their lounge, but ultimately decided against that.Unfortunately, Grace was a huge disappointment. While the environment was modern, relaxed and had a nice vibe (we particularly liked the changing music themes during our three-hour visit), the food, presentation and service were all below what we expected. The food seemed uninspired and repetitive, as many of the items on the menu we read about before in previous reviews. We anticipated a slightly different menu, or at least one that didn have many items we were already familiar with. The menu was also repetitive in the sense that Meyer Lemon appeared to be an ingredient that Chef Duffy likes a lot, as it appeared in about half of our courses.The service was also sub-par. My water glass was often empty and was occasionally replenished with still water rather than the sparkling water we asked for. The staff definitely made every attempt to be gracious and welcoming, but that occasionally came off as insincere and rushed. Most importantly, the staff didn engage in discussions about preparation or ingredients, but rather rushed the conversation to attend to another table or get back to the kitchen. It almost seemed like they were uncomfortable talking about the dish or wine we were enjoying. That sub-par service existed away from our table also, as one visit to the washroom was greeted with unclean space from the last visitor. We were particularly disappointed with the wine pairings, which were off the wine by the glass list rather than selected from the bottles based on the menu and evening, a practice many top restaurants ascribe to.Our overall impression of Grace was that they were in the business to make money, rather than create an experience. That theme was topped off as we walked out of the restaurant to get in our cab when the hostess handed us an envelope with a menu and chocolates inside; one of our servers should have presented us that gift, which we left in the cab.', 'I truly enjoyed my birthday dinner at Grace. The space, service and presentation are all impeccable. The food was very artistic and looked amazing, however, some of the dishes lacked the memorable experience that you will find with the dishes at Alinea or Next. Everyone in my group really enjoyed the wine pairings and felt that they went well with the courses that were served. Grace is a top 5 restaurant in Chicago and a fine new addition to the scene. Because of the price, Grace will remain a special event location, but I will definitely be back.', Wow Wow Wow!! Chef Duffy shows how skill and creativity can turn ingredients into unique experiences! The 5-star was strictly for the food only.Chef presented very creative dishes with interesting selection of familiar and more exotic ingredients. We all went for fauna, but one of my friends and I had to request for some flora items as we don't eat beef. It turned out we enjoyed the flora dishes the most!! The white asparagus and maitake are to-die-for. The maitake dish is probably the most umami-tasting dish I have ever had in my life. It was so good that thinking about it still makes me happy. The last bite was the bomb! It was a delicate palette-cleansing very thin shell of white chocolate truffle with lime juice inside. I know it sounds weird but it totally works. It was one of the most interesting texture and taste combination and definitely a very sexy way to end such exciting meal.And, the presentation of each dish is simply beautiful. Many dishes were like tiny flower gardens and you would be reluctant to taste them, because you don't wanna destroy that beauty. All the herb, leaf and vegetable were purposeful. I didn't find any ingredient to be superfluous.A very smooth, flawless and tantalizing experience! I am definitely a fan and will come again once chef changes the menu.Tips: We didn't do wine paring but ended up with 2 bottles of wine which we really like We had a kitchen tour at the end of the meal. The kitchen was meticulous and huge! It was almost the same size as the dining area There are 4 different restrooms with 4 different themes: Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall. I like the winter room :)  From the flora menu: Beets, Maitake and Rhubarb are like one of the best things you'd ever have, 'ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Chef Curtis Duffy has truly outdone himself! His amazing restaurant has only been open four months and simply, he is creating some of the best food one could hope for! Valerie and Michael were wonderful, as well, their inspiring wine pairings are awesome. Touring the kitchen it was amazing to see how much LARGER the space is than what he had at Avenues. And it is the most serene and quiet kitchen!!! Everyone is calm and it is the cleanest I have ever seen! Wonderful staff that is friendly and not pretentious also sets apart the character of this restaurant. The vibe was very Cali in color, but I truly feel that Chef Curtis is not trying to imitate - he is SETTING the BAR! Excellent job with everything! Noting - the asparagus soup was only on the menu 2 days, and it is AWESOME! The Scottish Salmon is TO DIE FOR! (these 2 items are NOT on the same menu side.....but if you want to swap out something from either side of the 2 menus, you can do that!) Absolutely AWESOME!', 'Peace and Tranquility. Was I in one of Chicago top spas? No. I was at one of Chicago top restaurants. But the same feeling came over me as I was welcomed at Grace . . . .and as the door closed, it shut the world outside off and allowed me to focus on a great evening of food and wine.There is no bar here to sit at, rather a lounge like living room with comfy chairs where you can have your drink brought to you and relax while you wait for the rest of your party or your table. As you are led to your table you will notice the quiet. I finally decided that they had forgotten to turn the music on (which did come on later in the night) but everything was hush hush which is odd as it is one big room with many tables but plenty of space between the tables.There are two fixed menus to choose from; the flora (veggie) and the fauna (meat) and each will cost you $185 per person. Want the wine pairings to go with it? An additional $110 per person. We decided to forego the wine pairings as my friend was loving his cocktail I was happy with the wines by the glass.We both chose Chef Duffy fauna menu starting with caviar and working our way through salmon and lamb and beef and other wonderful items. The presentation was beautiful to look at and each component of every dish demonstrated the thought that went into it.Along with the dishes there is also a bread designed to complement it. I trying not to eat carbs these days but when they placed that first bread course on the table . . .I was a goner!While most of the courses were perfect- there was one that we both didn like so after a taste we didn eat the rest of it. Not sure if that offended the chef but he sent out one of the courses from the flora menu which was delicious and we were back on track.The simple decor with the glass walled kitchen in the back makes the food the star. And make sure to check out the seasonal bathrooms- each being done in a season. The Winter one was my favorite with it ice like sink and water trickle that reminded me of a glacier run off.Know that this is a special occasion place. Even without the wine pairings, dinner and cocktails for two ran over $500. Definitely a splurge!If you drive- there is valet out front or a pay lot on the corner. And plan ahead. The manager told us that they are booking 2 months out. All in all- Chef Curtis Duffy is doing it up right. I now know why Grace is listed as one of Chicago best restaurants!', Wow! I decided to write this review because I think it is getting rarer and rarer to be able to enjoy a top notch food experience with exceptional service. The staff went above and beyond (all of our menu's had printed a happy birthday note to my wife) and a keen sense of when it was ok to interrupt conversation (one of the ladies in our group asked for her husbands jacket when she was chilly, and our server observing this immediately ran and found her a shawl). Our sommelier was knowledgeable and willing to educate without any pretension. The vegetarian tasting menu was the best I've had since Mugaritz in Spain. Well done Grace Restaurant., 'What can i say this place is amazing!!!I will start with this because this will show what kind of place this is. So my family and I decided to do the wine paring with our meal. The second wine came out and i really really enjoyed it a lot. I told my family and i guess the waiter over heard me saying how much i liked it. At the end of the night we were walking out and at the front they had an entire bottle of that wine in a bag for me compliments of Grace. We where blown away by this type of service and attention to detail. I could leave my review at that letting it speak for itself but ill go over the whole experience a little quickly. I have been to many high end places in my life and this was right up there in terms of decor, food, and service. You can quickly see Chef Duffy has incorporated what he learned at his previous places of work into Grace.The food was very well put together and every wine pairing seemed to fit very well. I chose the Fauna and the Waygu beef was outstanding. The salmon was also extremely well done paired with the other parts of the dish. Everyone in my family enjoyed their food. My mother got to full at the end (which to me is a good thing) but overall the portions were very nice. Most of the dishes are very fresh tasting and not to heavy. The season themed bathrooms were a nice touch and with all the wine I visited each one every time I came back a fresh napkin was there and someone to push my seat in. These are types of things you expect at a place like this and Grace certainly comes through.I really hope this place takes off cause Chef Duffy has clearly poured his heart and sole into it and it shows. The kitchen tour was a nice touch as well. I will certainly be back and i recommend this place to anyone looking for a wonderful evening that wont disappoint.', I think I am having an existential culinary crisis, but Curtis Duffy has reminded me of why I go out to eat at places like Grace (though there aren't many like it). It's for the challenge of trying something new. I don't mean eating offal new, I mean eating something that doesn't provide instant gratification, but makes you think about where the flavors are coming from and the interplay of ingredients. It's finding the different layers of sweetness introduced by the pineapple, fennel and tarragon in a parsnip purd9e. It's experiencing the transformation of taste, how the pungency of a rich white asparagus soup evolves when you mix in smokey, sweet grilled ramps. It's the invigoration of tasting ingredients I've had many times before in completely new ways. The Flora menu, although savory, incorporates a lot of unexpected, but pleasant sweetness, probably because that's the inherent flavor of vegetables. My beautiful dinner at Grace was easily one of the finest meals I've enjoyed., So Grace is the tour de' force that many Yelpers seem to indicate it is. However I wrestled with my rating on this one and thought about 4 stars before ultimately going with 5. The entire experience was outstanding - they didn't miss a beat. The food was creative and generally outstanding. I don't have anything to ding the place on at all. But I left feeling that for the money it should have hit a few more out of the park, and instead I felt like I'd experienced the whole place through a bit of a fog, where all the high points (and low points) had been polished off. We both got the Fauna menu, which had many winners. The Osetra dish was delicious and well composed - silky and smooth. But I found myself wanting more Osetra for the punch of salt the dish really needed. Kampachi was again outstanding but I found the Pomelo to be more mellow and less citrusy then I normally like. The dish did need a bit more acid from the Pomelo. Salmon with citrus pudding was outstanding and unlike anything I've had before. Not sure how the salmon was cooked by it was like butter. The dried artichoke with pistachio and curry was perhaps my favorite dish of the night - really unique with exceptional flavor and texture contrasts. The miyazaki beef with salsify and Mashua leaf was awesome - the beef melted in your mouth, but still maintained a wonderful toothsome crust which was well salted. Weird how I found some dishes under seasoned/salted and others spot on. The one dish I do continue to think about (in a good way - it was very memorable) is the caramelized sudachi custard with cashew and nasturtium. Wow, this was amazing, I've never had anything like it. The sudachi tasted fermented but sweet at the same time and played so well with the flavor and texture of the cashew. I loved it.Wine pairings were all good, and none I would fault, but none that blew me away.The room is lovely and very muted. Again, in keeping with my overall feeling about the place it was lovely but perhaps a bit too understated. I felt it was missing something, as I felt with a few of the dishes. Service was good and generally well paced, but it was missing the elements of precision I would have expected at a restaurant of this caliber.So I'm going with a gentleman's 5 star rating. Grace is a lovely restaurant that reaches high, and often achieves greatness. I'm still left feeling like it is operating in a bit of a fog, or perhaps the staff just needs one more shot of espresso when they get to work to kick it up one notch. Oh yeah, and a bit more salt please., There's so much to say about Grace but probably so few words to do it justice. It also doesn't help that my experience there is definitely not the norm. Therefor this post will be very light of written detail and just have more pretty pictures to look at. First of all, I went with a friend of Chef Duffy so I have no idea which courses were actually brought out and when, as I'm pretty sure the actual menu wasn't really followed, and definitely augmented (not complaining, just harder to recall in detail). We also had delicious wine pairings but again, I have no idea what they were - besides extremely tasty and well chosen. But less about me, here are a few observations of the experience at a high level. The food is by far the most artistic dishes I have ever seen in my life. Each one could double as a painting and not food, particularly with all of the whimsical and creative touches of texture and color that really make things stand out. There were no throw away courses, or courses that attempted to push your comfort zone just because the kitchen wanted to see you squirm. Everything was approachable and edible even if visually delicate. Comparisons of Grace to Alinea are natural given the history of the Chef, the price point and the style of the food. But I find that they are only similar at the surface (and maybe the damage to your wallet). Grace is a much more approachable restaurant in many regards and a place you could go for that wow meal without feeling like you're about to mortgage your house or that you might pick up the wrong utensil. There's an atmosphere of comfort and friendliness that persists. Maybe there are more circus tricks and wizardry happening at other spots in town but Grace has enough to make it fun but not too much to confuse or distract from the real show - the visual ART of delicious cuisine. If you are inclined to seek out a high quality, expensive, fun, different and beautiful dinner (that doesn't last 6 hours) - you should grab the next table at Grace., 'Thanks to the staff at Grace for an exceptional experience. Course menu was a journey; Open kitchen shows like a demonstration at the Mart.', My husband took me here for my birthday dinner. GREAT experience! The food was artful and unbelievably delicious. The dd9cor is understated elegance and the staff very friendly and knowledgeable. You get to watch them cook while you eat dinner and I was surprised by how calmly and efficiently everything goes in there. It felt a bit like watching a well-choreographed dance. I particularly loved that they invite diners to take a look at the kitchen. Super interesting to go back there and they have the most gorgeous wall with spices. I'm not a big drinker, so I did not get the full wine pairing, but my husband did and I took a sip out of each of his glasses. They made wonderful selections that really complimented the food.Well worth spending a special evening there. It was one of my best birthday dinners!, It was great, it really was. I was very lucky to get invited out to a dinner here, and have the chefs themselves explain our courses. The services was amazing, from wine explanation to the presentation of our food on to the table. Everyone was there to serve us and I felt almost like a princess.The reason why Grace got 4 stars instead of 5...basil. Ugh, it shouldn't be a problem but it was! After having two dishes out the first four from the fauna menu having some sort of basil tasting item. Whether it was a paste connecting items to the plate or a part of the dish, it all tasted like basil by the end of the dinner. The meat presented was cooked perfectly, and was smokey and full of flavor. Anything around it could have impregnated by basil. Even dessert. Should have had the flora menu., 'Brilliant! From the moment we walked in the door, the service and ambiance was amazing. The decor is simple yet so elegant and understated yet completely cool. With spa like music piped in and dim yet enough lighting, I was absolutely sure hubby and I were in for a delightful evening. We were seated right in front of the open window kitchen and had a birds eye view of the culinary action. (We realized that after our meal was complete, they gave one on one tours of the kitchen - how cool is that?)I had the flora menu and hubby had the fauna menu. Great way to taste all of the divine dishes. Along with that we opted for the wine pairings. Our sommelier was approachable and knew his wines - he was a delight. We had a three plus hour dinner that was perfect experience for my first time to Chicago. Being a foodie, I appreciated all of the details that Chef Duffy and his team provided, it was a heavenly meal. The service was top notch and the food combinations, preparations, presentations and taste was out of this world. If you want to experience a once in a lifetime food experience, Grace will not disappoint! Highly recommend!!!!!!!!', 'Juliet wrote Romeo a soliloquy; I am compelled to write about the Beet dish at Grace.Beet, I was awestruck by you. Today, I still wistfully miss you. With every bite you brought something anew. I tasted something cooked, something raw. Your flavors were abound; there was beet noodle, black garlic, apple, tarragon, and I think cocoa. Our time together was much too short although I savored every thoughtful bite of you. Au Revoir. I didn think Curtis Duffy could top the carrot dish but incredibly enough he did. My husband, a die-hard meat devotee but an ardent fan of the carrot dish said No way. It is clear the preponderance of diners at Grace order the fauna menu. Chef Duffy has incredibly enough though developed the ingenious ability to transform vegetables into a visual and sensory feast that will seduce from start to finish. The fauna menu is out of this world but the flora menu is undeniably better. As a child and much to my chagrin, meals at home were vastly vegetarian. I wowed I would eat all the meat and fish I wanted once I grew up. Little did I know that Curtis Duffy would forever change the way I think about vegetarian.I requested seating in the middle of the dining room and close to the fabulous interactive see-through kitchen. The restaurant obliged and the view was indeed the best in the house. Thank you Rebecca for making this happen.Just as a movie remake rarely does justice to a great book; words will do little homage to dinner at Grace. The caramelized date; one of four amuse bouches was divine. The crispy and sweet sunchokes adorned with mustard seeds, cippolini onion, lovage, and freekah was complex in flavors and just as exotic as the ingredients sound. The roasted Maitake served in mushroom broth with chunks of daikon and potato puree is rich and satisfying. As you are gorging yourself on all that fabulous food, here come the bread pairings. There that little voice in your head that tells you to stop eating bread because you are going to be so full but it so good that you just can stop...............and every last morsel and crumb of the bread is devoured. Leave your inhibitions at home if you truly want to experience Grace. A couple of us used our fingers to scrape up remnants of dishes. It really worth going after every last drop of the white asparagus soup. Desserts are a mind boggling progression from the light citrus flavors of kalamansi, rhubarb served three ways, finally giving way to deep dark chocolate. The standout dessert however is the indulgent caramelized sudachi custard, accompanied by cashews and nasturtium; an offering in the fauna menu. Thanks to the ever-attentive staff; one of our dining companions happily ended up with a second serving of the sudachi.Michael Muser wine pairings were a perfect accompany and an adventure of sorts. The Italian sparkling chardonnay Ferrari Perle was an excellent starter followed by the vibrant and minerally Spanish white Do Ferreiro Albarino that I couldn get enough of. There were interesting red in the mix including the Rolly-Gassmann Pinot and the Quinta Do Crasto Superior from Portugal. We ended dinner with a charming German Riesling from Balthasar Ress and Bodegas Dios Baco, an aromatic and fabulous Spanish sherry with tons of fruit, caramel, and toffee flavors. I was on a mission to check out the four seasons themed bathrooms and it was so much fun taking mini breaks from dinner to check them out. Especially the winter themed one with the fabulous water trickling sink that I visited twice. All that missing is Vivaldi Four Seasons pealing through each of the bathrooms. I particularly recommend the rousing version by German violinist Anne Sophie Mutter.', 'This would be my first of many epic meals as I headed east into Chicago, then eventually all over Europe for a month. Leaving SF and landing just shortly before dinner. Definitely one of the most anticipated meals for me in Chicago since Next the last time I was in town. Little did I know that the locale was just a hop away from what is becoming a huge restaurant row off of Randolph St. The front is fairly non descript. As we get out of the car there are two guys standing in the business next door just peering at us. As we walk up, there is a simple mirrored sign, in cursive. We walk into the entry and are greeted by a very friendly server, so takes us to our seats. We walk by what is a lounge to the right, a curve off to the restrooms and service stations. The main dining room is ahead, a set of sequestered two tops to the left, larger parties in the middle and then varied tables on the right. The open kitchen is in the far back where if you have the right angle, you can see the full back of house service. Service stations are scattered throughout the room, integrated into the structural columns, which is an ingenious touch. Wee greeted by some servers and start to look at the menus. There are two menus, a Flora and a Fauna, concentrating on various vegetables and proteins. As a table of four it made sense to have two people order each and split the menus halfway, getting the most variety for everyone. As it our first night we go full into the wine pairings to boot. Chris, The sommelier comes out. We look at each other, a hesitation in recognition. I recognize him as my server previously as my Captain over at Graham Elliot. He remembers exactly where I was seated. Then I get to talking to our server Tyrone, turns out he and Chris both used to work at the same hotel company. Another server comes out who used to work at Charlie Trotter. I ask him about my previous Captain there, Tomas, and sure enough they knew each other. The world is a crazy small place. How is it that my first night in town and Ie run into people Ie met before and others who are one degree in separation? Crazy.After all the choices and talk subside out adventure went as follows:Flora:Parsnipdried pineapple, tarragon ice, FENNELSweet Pealime, radish, BLOOMSBeetblack garlic, apple, TARRAGONSunchokebraised mustard seeds, freekeh, cippolini onion, LOVAGEWhite Asparagusgrilled ramp, glass noodle, OPAL BASILMaitakepreserved daikon, coffee, SCALLIONKalamansiasian pear, black lime, GARDEN SORRELRhubarbchartreuse, buddha hand, toasted brioche, LEMON BALMDark Chocolateraw chestnut, mandarin, LEMON MINTFauna:Osetra Caviarmeyer lemon, kumquat jam, CHIVE BLOOMSKampachicoconut, pomelo, THAI BASILSquabkaffir, green strawberry, SORRELArtichokesicilian pistachio, sweet curry, DANDELIONMiyazaki Beefking trumpet, salsify, MASHUA LEAFLambkale, parsley root, MINER LETTUCEPoached Pearelderflower, tamarind juice, FENNELCaramelized Sudachitoasted cashew, ginger, NASTURTIUMYoung Coconutlime, huckleberry, AFRICAN BLUE BASILNow this is the way to start out your first meal in town. Chef Duffy and team are firing on all cylinders. When people are shying away from tasting menus and going the more casual route, Grace ups the ante with a very ambitious fine dining concept. I know that theye aiming squarely at 3 Michelin stars as the goal and Im thinking theye in the 2 star range already. Of course this is nothing new for Chef Duffy who did it at Avenues. Delicious, creative cuisine all around. The staff took really good care of us, but I think that goes without question, and with the familiarity, we had a great time not worrying about whether the place was going to be stuffy. They react to what you give them and since Im good about taking the fine out of fine dining, it was a blast. After everything was said and done and we closed the restaurant down, we took a tour of the whole place ending in the Tim Harrison designed kitchen; if youe seen Alinea, Per Se, TFL, Benu and Saison, youe seen his particular style. Speaking of style check out all the restrooms which are designed around the four seasons. We chatted very briefly with Chef Duffy and then made our way to the lobby. In speaking with the rest of the staff, they were awesome to give us a whole bunch of recommendations to where they like to eat, which we used for the rest of the trip. A tremendous debut, which I hope reverses what seems to be a demise of fine dining in Chicago (RIP Trotter, Avenues, RIA, Graham Elliot)', Heirloom tomato dish. New for the summer - best bites of the evening. All courses were pretty good. One of the hostesses was not happy when I said there was only one A... But a few B+s. In my life, I am not to double digit courses that get an A. All the side breads... They don't come close to the homemade rye and black cod lardo from el ideasBtw, that beet review is why I chose Grace... Not so much, beautiful but did not live up to that review - not even close. But I should say thank you Rupa, without you I don't get that tomato course, 'We had a really beautiful and elegant 5th wedding anniversary dinner here. I thought the wines were paired really nicely, my husband thought they were lacking some oomph (he likes a bigger wine than what was being paired with the delicate dishes). All of the food was beautifully presented and delicious, with the lamb and coconut cake courses really standing out.Watch out for those raspberry-white chocolate bites at the end - mine exploded all over me!Service was fantastic, and at the end of the meal we were taken back to the kitchen for a little observation. Grace is really exceptional, and the name is perfect for what they are doing.', 'Grace was basically a perfect meal. My boyfriend and I went for our anniversary and found the place to be romantic and quiet, which was just what we wanted. I a pescatarian and we let them know ahead of time. They asked again when we were seated about food resrtictions and they had no problem accomodating me. I got the flora and my boyfriend got the fauna so we were able to see the full offerings of both menus and sample each others!The food was imaginative, fun, and most importantly, delicious! Everything was interesting and incredible, from tasty little homemade breads with flavored butters to edible flowers to steaming frozen desserts. Also, the wine pairings were very nice and complimented the dishes very well. It clearly a slurge, but if you have a reason to splurge, Grace should be the place you do it.', 'Seems a reasonable place to write my 2000th Yelp review. Obviously more details in the blog, but overall a stellar meal...Even before Kevin Pang inspired (and inspiring) article in The Tribune Grace had been on my radar - my single meal at Avenues would have been more than enough to get me in the door, but having followed much of the chef and restaurant story in the months preceding its grand opening had me truly excited to see what Curtis Duffy, a man who literally cooked minutes from my previous home in Dublin, was capable of in his very own space.A surprisingly easy reservation, made by phone precisely when the reservations window opened, my friend and I made our way into the elegant dining room where we were given a prime seat gazing into the showpiece kitchen and with lavish yet friendly service from beginning to end it became quite obvious that Chef Duffy time at Alinea had not only influenced him in the kitchen, but how to manage front of house affairs as well. A simple choice, Flora or Fauna, and the evening began with a glass of wine before moving onto a nearly three hour tasting with gifts from the Flora frequently bespeckling the Fauna menu we each selected - one dish presented by Curtis himself with a thanks for coming in, followed by a kitchen tour later.Moving past the room, the service, the plating, the stemware, and even the easonallavatories - all more than worthy of mention - to the food, it should go without saying that as much thought was given to each of Duffy creations as was lavished on the restaurant itself and with a deft hand trending towards the sweeter side of the palate I personally found each plate to be not only beautiful and balanced, but truly xcitingwith each bite offering something new - a flavor, texture, or concept to explore - the whole always more than the sum of its parts with no savory showing this more than the gifted Flora Poached Chestnut whose texture ran the gamut from crispy to creamy and fibrous to silken all while floating the aromatics of truffle atop sweet and smoky chestnuts. With each savory beautifully composed and vegetables both common and novel aplenty the dessert half of the menu would prove equally compelling, each dish featuring at least one herbal component that lingered on the palate until the next plate arrived; the tableside prepared Cranberry showing that with a refined hand pine can truly prove a wondrous foil to both sweet and bitter while the Sudachi came across with a spicy finish quite unlike any dessert Ie experienced - a risky move that worked beautifully not only in itself, but in the progression to the Chocolate finale.Having heard some suggest that the food at Grace leans too far to the sweet but personally possessing a predilection for such flavors I will simply say that what Curtis Duffy and his team have achieved so far at Grace is exactly what I had hoped for; another estinationrestaurant in the Windy City - one that exceeded my admittedly high expectations and one to which I cannot wait to return.', Had a fantastic meal last night at Grace. Service was amazing, friendly and not stuffy. Staff seemed bustling but in a coordinated dance. Decor was simple. Music was nice though at times a little obtrusive based on track selection. All chairs were pitched at the kitchen which was behind a glass wall, much like a TV on in the background during our meal, which I like.The meal was perfectly paced. We had each the Flora and Fauna and all...ALL dishes were excellent. Like works of art on presentation though unlike some other restaurants (i.e. NEXT-Vegan-bleh) tasted perfectly balanced and delicious all together. Not sure I'd do the Truffle add-on again, though risotto was amazing, the truffle was a bit subtle for my taste (though i'm no truffle expert).Watch yourself with the wine pairing...hefty pours, virtually a new pair with each dish. The sommelier was nice, informative and definitely not overly pretentious like many other sommeliers when you don't really understand what they're saying.Check out all the bathrooms. Each different modeled after the 4 seasons. Had a nice tour of the kitchen afterwards.Would definitely recommend Grace if it's at your price-point. One of the best restaurants in Chicago, definitely gives Alinea a run for its money. I hope Michelin recognizes Grace with 3 stars! One of the best meals I've had in a long time. Thank you guys!, 'unreal', This was definitely a great dining experience. Each course was a delicious mix of flavors and textures.The tasting menu concept is exciting because we tried dishes we wouldn't have normally tried. I loved the use of liquid nitrogen. The prices are steep- $185 a person. At the end of the meal they give you a tour of the kitchen which is a really cool experience. It is a well-oiled machine. The reason I give 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because the wine pairing was not a good pair with the meal. Whenever a restaurant offers a wine pairing, we always say yes and trust the sommelier. Not this time. Too many really sweet wines that didn't match the meal. Super disappointed in this aspect of the meal. The price was a bit shocking as well. I had read online that the wine pairing cost between $85 and $95. It was $125. I agree with other posters that the restaurant is really quiet. I felt like we were interrupted by waiters every 10 minutes while we were talking. Had it been noisier in the restaurant, it probably wouldn't have felt like this.Overall- a nice place to splurge, but I'd ask to see the pairing list first before committing to it. You might have a better choice if you are a wine connoisseur., Oh wow we loved Grace!We arrived late for our reservation last week, and were warmly greeted anyway by Tess and taken to our perfect table by Jason - a cozy table against the wall with a view of the shiny white and chrome, bustling contemporary kitchen (for me) and the lovely, calming, beautiful restaurant (my companion). (We don't recommend being late; we regret the missed minutes.) The service, food, wine, dd9cor and ambiance were exquisite. Everything flowed naturally like a modern dance in synch with our timing. We loved Christian the sommelier; not sure who other reviewers were talking about. We found his suggestions well matched to our preferences. (We did not have the wine pairing for our first visit, but we think we will next time.) As you can read in my other reviews, I've been lucky to have some great meals this summer. This one is right up there with the best of them. Compared to (sorry) Next (vegan), there was no comparison. Every plate, every bite, every garnish looked and tasted delicious. It all felt innovative, perfect and delicious at the same time. We loved the little breads, especially the pretzel bread. (Would like some right now!) Like other reviewers, one of us had the flora and the other the fauna. We were encouraged to trade out the two things we don't eat. Keep in mind this is definitely a high-priced meal. But if you are into food and have the budget, it is unquestionably worth it.Because the experience is so special, we wondered for a few days afterwards how often we would come back. On reflection, we would happily dine here at least seasonally to sample Chef's progressive creativity. I agree with other reviewers about Michelin star recognition. Two or three? Need another visit....The restaurant has a beautiful private room that would be perfect for a special intimate event. We loved the four seasonal bathrooms too. Try Grace. We can't imagine how you would be disappointed., 'Let me begin by saying that we had a wonderful time, the food was delicious, and the wine was good. The dishes were tasty and interesting, with unique flavors and fresh ingredients. For many of the courses, combining the special flavors resulted in something even more delicious. And the service as impeccable! If 4.5 stars were an option, I would give it. The reason I am not going to give 5 stars is because of the wine pairing. There are two courses on the menu, the Flora and the Fauna. Some people in our group tried the Flora, and others the Fauna. I noticed that we were all being poured the SAME wine (albeit from a fancy decanter and with good descriptions of the vintage). And while all of the wine was delicious, the idea of a Pairing is to Match EACH wine to EACH course -- not to try to find wines that will work with both a savory meat dish and a sweeter vegetable dish, for example. With only a 1 or 2 of my 9 courses did I find myself saying (in non-gourmet speak) OMG this wine makes the food even better!But for me, the most important criteria for a restaurant is the Service. And this is one point in which Grace EXCELS. Tyrone and the rest of the wait staff made sure that our evening was relaxed, enjoyable, and memorable. This was my birthday dinner away from home, and we were there to enjoy, and so enjoy we did!', Simply the best in Chicago. Chef Duffy is a force to be reckoned with. Both pre fix menus are phenomenal in their own unique symphony. The staff is professional and leaders of their industry- Amy is fantastic and so impressive! Showcase kitchen is gorgeous and everyone in there is good looking. They deserve at least 2 Michelin stars if not 3 and yet they stay humble. In the past year I've dined at Daniel, Eleven Madison Park, Per Se, Goosefoot, El Ideas, Alinea, Next (3 menus), Daniel and Le Bernardin. Grace is in my top 3. Well done., 'Not only the very best meal of my entire 46 years, but not just the complex flavors, but the service, the decor, the whole shebang. Wow.True grace.', If you have ever wondered what it would be like to drop over $400 per person on a single meal, then Grace is the place to try!! Not that I have much to complain about (aside from damage to my credit card) - other than one tiny portion of one dessert course (some lime-esque sorbet covered by tasteless crunchy whatever), I couldn't find a single thing that didn't exceed expectations. Service and food and atmosphere were excellent. So excellent, in fact, that we are planning on coming back at the end of the year. The menu changes seasonally, so once per season is about the most that the average diner would want to return. Unless you have access to a generous trust fund that would allow you to dine here more frequently...., Our experience at Grace was easily one of the best we've had anywhere. We were celebrating an anniversary, and each person we interacted with throughout the evening made sure to wish us a happy one. Both my husband and I are vegetarian, and they easily adapted the Flora menu to be completely vegetarian. Each course was well-balanced and nuanced, and the presentation was lovely. Standouts included the Black Truffle Creme Caramel (perhaps one of the most divine things I've ever tasted!), the Sweet Pea with lime and coconut, and the Kalamansi with asian pear. We also opted to try the elder flower lemonade as a beverage, and found it to be fantastic. I would be remiss in writing a review of Grace without mentioning the impeccable service. The courses were very well paced and the entire staff genuinely seemed happy to be there. Servers are friendly and approachable, and made the dining experience even more pleasant. We were offered a kitchen tour at the end of our meal, and were extremely impressed with both the kitchen layout and the plating process. Watching the kitchen staff working is like poetry in motion -- truly beautiful to behold., My wife made a reservation for us because of my birthday. The room is beautiful, the sevice perfect and the food was great art. I have had the opportunity to eat at many tremendous restaurants and would put in the top 20, but not the top 10. I elected to have the wine pairings and I think that I would have rather spent the money on a nice bottle of wine. My wife had a bottle of white wine that she enjoyed through dinner. I understand the concept of pairings, but was underwhelmed by the wines. To be fair, each wine matche the dishes nicely, but I didn't enjoy all of them. The food on the other hand was perfection. I have eaten Chef Duffy's food on several occasions when at the Peninsula, but at Grace he has lifted the food up to a higher plane. Every dish was a contrast of sweet, sour, salty and unami. Then he took it up and added contrasting textures and temperatures. Several of the dishes, I just looked at and admired the art before devouring every morsel. No one can claim to know the Chicago dining scene without having experienced Grace., All I can say is WOW. We had a business dinner at Grace in the private dining room. I have been to many fine dining restaurants and Grace is truly unique. The food comes out and looks like art and the servers explain everything to you. For people who want a big entree with sides, this probably isn't the place for you. The meal is filling, creative, and tastes wonderful. I would also say that the service is amazing, the servers are knowledgable, friendly, and will really take care of you. They come frequently but do it in a way where you don't really notice them. To top the night off, they let us tour the kitchen when we were finished with our meal, a great dining experience, I would highly recommend it!, Third time and still no strikes...at all. Hits: Perfectly paced performance between the kitchen and the front of house. Every course will be flawlessly executed. Including those that are not for your palate. As an aside, the staff is as stuffy or casual as your dining companions require. A refreshing experience. Misses: Really none. But to nitpick, wines pairings could be improved, but they are pairings so costs have to balance. Plus, the wine staff is engaging, knowledgeable, and great at showmanship. (Riedel may / should pay the crew commision for promoting their decanters.)Hints: Pace yourself. The portions are generous for a tasting menu. Enjoy what you love, taste what you like, and give a few tries to what isn't for you. Also, take a kitchen tour when it is offered. Bottom line: a foodie paradise with a beautifully modern / minimal design and five star service., 'Fantastic and worthy up Michelin recognition!', 'Grace is simply divine. My fiancd9 and I went to celebrate our two year anniversary, and the menus at the table greeted us with a special Happy Anniversary message. What a nice personal touch to start the night on the right note. Our sommelier helped us select a delightful bottle of French wine, and we opted to try each of the tasting menus offered so we could taste everything. Each course was delicate yet flavorful, and the presentation was stunning. We also enjoyed the personal tour of the kitchen after the meal. I could not have asked for more of our experience at Grace!', I see stars in the future... michelin stars that is. ((update::: Grace receives not 1, but 2 michelin stars- did I predict that or what))Beautiful lovely tranquil ambiance as you enter. I felt at peace all through out dinner. Others have said they felt like they were in a spa. I totally agree. (Although the music was off at times, yes that is my one complaint ok)We did the fauna menu... everything was perfection. Absolutely loved the sommelier!! If you're a foodie who loves fine dining, Grace is a must for you! Oh and yes folks, the bathrooms were gorgeous :), Grace, we finally meet.The service is perfect, as expected, and the kitchen is impeccably clean. We had a table with a nice view of the kitchen so we could watch them tweezer away.The Flora menu was better than the Fauna menu.Bread service is always appreciated. My fave was the mini pretzel epi baguette. It was so cute, I wanted to take it home and pretend feed it to my Barbies.The bathrooms are beautiful. I took pictures of the interior so we can do our future bathroom remodel after it. For serious.I hate to say it, but I did not enjoy the dessert as much as I was hoping. Since dessert was 1/3 of the meal, and also I love dessert, it was a bit disappointing. This new trend of incorporating unexpected vegetables into dessert is just not cool, man. I do not like celery in my coconut dessert. No thank you vegetable dessert trend.For those of you who are non-alcoholics, they offer an Elderflower soda that is so delicious. It looks like this: amazon.com/Elderflower-P43_ and tastes like this reactiongifs.com/wp-cont43_ This soda itself negated the vegetable desserts.If you're looking for fancy-pants dining and Alinea is just too science-y for you, then go to Grace, it's currently my favorite fancy restaurant in Chicago., The massive majority of reviews for Grace are positive, and I understand that. I wanted to leave one that's not from an ardent foodie - just a regular restaurant-goer who likes to try food all over the spectrum.We had the vegetarian tasting menu with wine pairings. The first thing to say is that Grace had, hands down, the best service I've ever had in a restaurant. The second thing to say is that for me - on that specific night - the food didn't match it.You can read about the individual dishes in other reviews. I'll say that there were great bites (sadly the best was the amuse-bouche) but overall the menu was too one-note for me, with tons of citrus and sugar in it. I didn't have any dishes that really stopped me in my tracks. Everything was interesting, and no doubt beautifully sourced and prepared. But I never had the moment where dining combines with theater and craft to create a great moment.I will say - the bread was exceptional.I think real Chicago foodies probably need to try this place. If you're like me, and don't feel compelled to spend $500 on a meal more than once or twice a year, I would probably go to Alinea or Next...still, I wish them luck, and would just like to end by again saying: impeccable, lovely service., A fantastic meal from start to finish. The sommelier was knowledgable and friendly. He walked you through the wine pairing (which I highly recommend) with excitement and ease.The food was fantastic. Not too foofoo. We felt like we hand a great meal that was filling yet elegant. It's a lovely place for a date or special event.|3
21|ichimura-at-brushstroke-new-york|Chef Ichimura's personal attention + intimacy of the sushi bar + one of the best places for uni in NYC = 5 sparkling stars for Ichimura at Brushstroke (note: the absence of any one of these three would persuade me to go with 4 stars)I had already been a big fan of Brushstroke when I read the NYT review about its hidden sushi bar. The review had come out on the last Tuesday of September and by the time I called to make a reservation on Saturday of that week, the next availability was at the end of November. Just as well. It was something to look forward to after a three week vacation in Asia. The sushi bar is to the right when you enter Brushstroke. You'd hardly notice it's there. You enter through the fabric screens hanging above the entryway. It's true, there are only 8 seats at the sushi bar. There's also a small table in the room--it was occupied by 5 women when we were there. I wouldn't really want to sit there though. Chef Ichimura interacted with all of us at the sushi bar but I don't think he ever went up to the table. (Cf. when I had visited Neta, Chef Kim had personally gone up to each of the tables to speak with the diners.)Chef Ichimura is extremely soft-spoken. I only heard about 77% of what he said. I'd imagine it's difficult to know what you're eating if you're not familiar with sushi. The only reason this would matter though is if you can't remember the names of your favorites, which you get to request at the end of the omakase. Otherwise, who cares which fish you're eating when you're bound to enjoy it regardless of which particular one you're tasting, right? ;)Our meal started with this delicious egg custard with dungeness crab and truffle. I could have this for breakfast everyday. (Did I mention I just returned from Asia? Gosh, I miss Asian breakfasts.) We then received a row of amuse bouche sized appetizer bites--monkfish liver, daikon radish, giant clam, gobo roots, Japanese mushrooms, herring roe, cooked fatty tuna, and (this was really the best part), a mini bowl of some perfectly fresh sea urchin in seawater. I really can't stress how good the uni was. It was definitely a highlight of the night.Afterwards, we moved on to sashimi. There were several varieties of snapper (all from Japan), grouper, anchovies, amberjack, chutoro, otoro, and--my second favorite of the night--the giant clam! I actually requested the mirugai twice and I think the Chef expected me to request it a third time ;) All the fish were kept in one of several trays in the refrigerator behind the Chef. He would occasionally pick up a slab and describe it to us, using a lot of hand gesture to supplement his words. I assume his English isn't the best. I was envious of the Japanese couple next to us that carried on a fluent conversation with the Chef. Luckily, they were at the tail end of their meal when we got there. I would have felt very left out... although the two men who took their spot afterwards seemed to have a very special relationship with the Chef as well. When we moved on to sushi, we tried the mackerel, both fresh and aged, something from the striped bass family, shima aji (my third favorite of the night), and some others that had made earlier appearances. The Chef certainly has his own dance when he prepares his sushi. (You might also notice the shape of his hands and fingers. You tell me, what do you think of them? ;p) Arigato gozaimasu, Chef Ichimura. It was such a pleasure dining with you!, Incredibly warm and personalized service from Chef Ichimura. The sushi is great and speaks for itself (i.e., it's not like Gari and all dressed up; it's plain and simple (but delicious) sushi)., Total: 4.5 Ever since Brushstroke Ichimura was introduced in the New York Times, it has been difficult to make a reservation; they should be made up to at least one month in advance. Fortunately, my friend had reserved 2 seats and I was given the privilege of sitting at the sushi bar. Immediately after sitting, I was impressed by cleanliness of Chef Ichimura's workplace and automatically felt there was something different from other sushi places. There is no menu; the chef serves Omakase style starting from $150. Of course, it's expensive, but it's worth every penny. Just try it.Food: 5.0 Wonderful without question! Definitely top-notch and my favorite sushi place so far. Ichimura prepared the sashimi and sushi with a graceful economy of movement, and all the sushi I had was amazing. Note: Price of Nihonshu (Sake) is relatively expensive for small portions...Service: 4.0 Great. The server was professional and attentive. I was comfortable and relaxed to enjoy the meal. Because the kitchen (where the drinks were prepared) is a little far from the sushi bar, it took time to deliver the drinks each time we ordered them.Decor: 4.0 Modern and simple decor - the only thing appropriate for enjoying Ichimura's sushi world. Good for a date, with friends (a party for 3 or less), business, or alone., The personal attention of Chef Ichimura was the best part of this establishment, as well as his personal touch (he is growing a 'pet' mountain yam on the side of his prep area). The sommelier was very knowledgeable, and was willing to serve us a carafe of a sake that was supposed to be by the bottle only. The space is small and intimate, yet spacious enough to give couples the room they need. The blond wood gives the place a warm, homey feeling. The food is actually, by my count, generous enough to justify the price. The uni, deliciously sweet and delicate, is from Maine rather than Japan or California, and has its own unique characteristics. The chef serves a very wide variety of fish, of whatever is in season, plus very good cuts of fatty tuna. He knows that the way to my heart is through otoro and uni! His rice deserves a mention- it has a high acid content from the vinegar, and I liked it very much. His wasabi is very delicate, and I recommend that even people who don't like wasabi give it a try. Desserts are shared with Brushstroke, and I recommend the green tea pudding., 'The deification of sushi continues unabated. From its humble origins as cheaply preserved sustenance with a long shelf-life, to widespread street food, it has reached the point where people wait months for the privilege of paying nearly two hundred dollars for an omakase experience - a tasting tour led nearly exclusively by the chef. Ensconced in a quiet corner of Brushstroke, at a bar of blond wood and pendant lights, Eiji Ichimura is the latest chef to receive months in advance reservations following widespread praise. Having had to cancel my earlier reservation due to Sandy, I eagerly awaited its rescheduled date, ruing the small Wells authored blurb in the Times. Surprisingly however, when M and I stepped through the light noren, we found ourselves the sole diners. Our hostess informed him of my shellfish allergies, and slipped away to return with the nigori we ordered. Along with the carafe, however, were our servings of chawanmushi, a savory egg dish meant to, as Ichimura-san put it warm you up before you are cooled by the sushi. The earthiness of the mushrooms, the brightness of the green onion and the faintly sweet tofu all aided the boldness of the thick dashi mixture. The intensity of its flavors caught me by surprise, in a dish that is normally an afterthought. The same could be said for the tray of Ichimura-san take on amuse - a small portion of monkfish liver, seared fatty tuna, several marinated vegetables such as daikon and gobo root, with my uni being replaced by a dish of roe and a dish of a variety of mushrooms. Each bite was a poignant rendition of a particular flavor or texture - herring roe a layer of slippery crunchiness gilding a transiently soft interior. Monkfish liver acted a fine substitute to foie gras with surprising depth afforded by its light salinity. The cooked fatty tuna was the least enjoyable, but only because the raw version is such a simple, carnivorous pleasure that to sear away that texture feels somehow wrong. However, safe in the knowledge that you will enjoy more than your fill of gustatorially pleasing rich, lean, and fatty textures, you can appreciate the execution of the searing.Shortly after Ichimura-san removed our trays, he began peeling and grating the wasabi. If you watch him for extended periods of time, you will marvel at the effortless swiftness with which he moves from one task to the next, constantly aware of the changing dynamics of his situation. When a foursome of Australians entered, he had already begun preparing their trays of appetizers, as naturally as anything. Occasionally, he would engage us in conversation., which presented one of the few difficulties of the evening: Ichimura-san manner of speaking is terrifically hushed. Having earlier asked him if photography was acceptable in my somewhat informal Japanese, I was surprised to hear him say ikkuri shimashita(two people probably got that joke) but in actuality, I had misheard him. However, if you strain to listen, you will encounter a rather wry, excitable man, his eagerness to please matched only by his dedication to his craft. As each piece of sashimi was placed in front of us, he would tell us the type of fish and a bit about its origins, down to what region of Japan it came from. The freshness is immediately perceptible, evidenced by both the gliding ease with which the knife carves its slices and the slight give of the flesh under one teeth. The grouper in particular evoked all the pleasurable sensations eating sashimi can bring. The array of mackerel and snapper, each species tasting distinct but under a general umbrella of familiarity, was eminently enjoyable.As we moved on to sushi, the graceful speed of Ichimura-san became even more pronounced. It seemed as though pieces materialized before us as soon as their predecessors were consumed. And consume we did. The slightly punchier vinegar notes of his rice make the proceedings all the more addicting. Further fueling the consumption is Ichimura-san generosity. Upon seeing my mildly amusing fistpump at the appearance of the shima aji, he began serving me slightly larger pieces of it. At the conclusion of our scripted session, he insisted that we have a few more pieces of what we enjoyed most, rather than the customary asking. The bounteous slabs of otoro he placed in front of us were beyond what either of us expected, and he again insisted that we have a few more pieces of other fish. One would have to be exceedingly foolish to refuse him. As I accepted with a 'hontou ni arigatou,a phrase too formal to be said in those circumstances, I really did surprise him. Truthfully, he earned that level of gratefulness. Omakase in New York has a new pinnacle.', 'I love you Ichimura! and all your delicious sashimi of course!Booked a reservation three months in advance, since like everyone else I only heard of this offshoot of Brushstroke through the New York Times Review. There are eight seats at the bar and two small tables, but I honestly don think that they open up those tables for dinner unless you specifically request for a table. The experience was very pleasant. We had a 6:30pm reservation, which appeared to be the first dinner time slot for the night and being the first party and only party in that time slot, we got all of the chef attention and got to speak to him a bit before other parties started to arrive.Chef Ichimura is a bit softspoken as some other reviewers have mentioned, so sometimes I struggled to hear what he was saying. He told us all the names of the fish, sometimes a bit of background like where it came from. If you know enough about sushi he will go into what fish family it belongs to, and what some of the sauces are made of. I don remember all the names of the fish he served us, but there was definitely lots of toro - which happens to be one of my favorite fishes so no complaints. There were some fish that Ie never heard of before so that was added something different to our sushi knowledge base. Some of the highlights were the chawanmushi, uni, various cuts of toro, and the japanese roasted tea pudding.The price wasn that expensive considering how much fish we actually got, or if you want to think about it, you get more expensive fish. I discovered a delicious sake called Yoshida Tedorigawa Kinka old BlossomNama Daiginjo. Ie seen this particular bottle before, but was never able to find it. We spoke with the sommelier, at first we picked a different unpasteurized sake but they were out. He said let me check if they have a different one in stock, when he brought the bottle of Kinka I knew we had to have it. I would highly recommend it, they sell it for $90 a bottle.If it wasn so hard to get a reservation, we would definitely go back to Ichimura.---We went to Ichimura on Saturday and Brushstroke on Sunday. Twice in a weekend!', Decided to benchmark Ichimura at Brushstroke against my usual go-to's, 15 East and Sushi AzabuMon, Jan 28 - 15 EastWed, Jan 30 - IchimuraFri, Feb 1 - 15 EastSat, Feb 2 - IchimuraSun, Feb 3 - Sushi AzabuThurs, Feb 7 - IchimuraThe soy sauce for the sashimi course is absolutely delicious.Rice at Azabu reminds me the most of good sushi rice in Japan. 15 East can certainly have delicious rice, though it's the most inconsistent of the three. Sometimes leans too much on the assertive side. Azabu is generally very consistent, very well balanced and nuanced, neither subtle or assertive. Ichimura is more on the more subtle side, with less prominent flavors than I usually got at the sushi places I used to frequent while in Tokyo. Texture, temperature is good though. Pressed without being overly firm. Not overcooked, sticky or mushy in the slightest. Nicely subtly warm.Fish quality and preparation at Ichimura is remarkable. While all three represent fairly traditional edo-mae style sushi, the aging and seasoning is different from the other two, and quite frankly, different from what I used to get in Tokyo. Saba texture leaned somewhat meat-like (as opposed to fish-like) - a hint of gamy, reminding me of just barely of a touch of good liver. It's aged. Ichimura-san doesn't pickle it as much in vinegar and it's noticeable. It's an eye opening and utterly delicious experience for me. Kohada preparation is a little more traditional, but the flavors are spot on. Strong, bold, deep, with just the perfect balance of fish, oil, vinegar.There's just a depth of flavor and texture that goes beyond what I usually get, even at Azabu and 15 East. A higher level of refinement as well. Kombu preparations are nicely prevalent. Fundamental fish quality is very high. Ankimo texture is creamier and more delicate than you can usually get in the US. Much more like higher end ankimo you get from Japan. Uni is nice and briney and plump. All the fish preparations are of high quality, though not all are as interesting to me. Probably more personal preference, though some is the inherent nature of the fish. Toro isn't interesting to me, and Ichimura-san knows this and serves me other hikari-mono instead.Did have an excellent negi-toro temaki though to finish off the meal. Preparation of both the negi and the toro were different from the usual course chopped hash that you get in Japan. Negi was finely chopped while the toro was left less adultered. Somehow the three main ingredients - toro, rice, nori - each of which I think is good but not amazing come together to be amazing with the fine balance in the roll.Items that came from Brushstroke are disappointing. Ordered tamago at the end of one meal - was disappointingly sub par (especially compared to peers). Miso soup at the end lacks the deep depth and shrimp essence of the akadashi at Azabu. Chanwan mushi at the beginning is fancy and good, but I think overrated. Surprisingly limited sake/beer list.At $160 seems more expensive than Azabu and 15 East, but you get more food, probably too much for many appetites. I find the value proposition quite compelling.It's hard not to think about the different personalities behind each of the counters. All I can say is I'm a huge fan of each of Ichimura-san, Shimizu-san and Terado-san though for different reasons. All are class acts.Ultimately, I go to sushi trying to recreate the experience I had at good/solid (but not high end) neighborhood sushi restaurants in Tokyo. Azabu still hits this the best, and is still my favorite due to the quality of the rice. In fact, Azabu probably best captures the neighborhood experience due to some of their weaknesses as well. Ichimura is doing something a little different than the other two with his edo-mae sushi. I'm impressed and will certainly be back often, though it's not exactly what I'm seeking., Amazing Edo-style sushi prepared by Ichimura. I was lucky to get a reservation a mere 1 hour before.. (This was the day before the Blizzard in Feb 2013..) Remember, its omakase only! My omakase for the day consisted of Chawan Mushi with Dungeness Crab and seasoned with truffles9 pieces of zen sai20 pieces (a piece was usually 2 slices) of Sashimi, including otoro and uni12 pieces of Sushi All fresh fish from Japan, never frozen, all seasonal. Generous portion size--- it filled my voracious appetite.. Wasabi was freshly made right before serving. Most of the fish I had never even heard of before, so it was a great delight to expand my sushi horizons... The majority of the sashimi was all lighter fish, with more mild flavors.. The sushi was served 1 piece at a time. The right amount of soy was applied by Ichimura. The rice was warm, firm, mild, with a slight vinegar taste, and what I consider in a perfect ratio for the fish. The flavor of the fish was able to come out, with the rice, vinegar, soy, and wasabi complementing the fish..My favorites were:1. O-toro Chu-toro combo sushi. A piece of two types of toro, aged edo style, squished together on rice. Very great flavor, melted in my mouth. Aged toro has a slightly richer and more gamey flavor than its fresher counter part. 2. Freshly toasted/baked Anago. I was never a big fan of sea eel, but Ichimura set me right with his amazingly fresh and flaky Anago with a slight amount of soy.3. Chawan Mushi (a brushstroke prepared item) was amazing. I really am not a fan of egg custard, but this did have exceptionally good flavor.4. Winter wild yellow tail (hamachi) sashimi (mid rib cut). Totally seasonal, great flavor.5. The wasabi. Fresh made to order.. Lightly and fluffy.. What I enjoyed more than Ichimura's culinary skills was his great personality and the effort he made to make sure all his patrons had a great experience. After the omakase finished, he asked everyone several times if there was anything else they wanted. I got 4 extra pieces for a reasonable $20 extra (Omakse starts at $150 and goes up based on what you add). He was more than happy to cater to whatever I wanted.. Please be warned that he is really big on fresh fish and will not carry anything that has been frozen or not considered a sushi fish.. So no sweet shrimp (ebi) nor unagi..I am always interested in a experiencing new sushi, and Ichimura and his edo-style aged sushi was amazing.. I recommend this place if you are going for his omakse experience.. Ichimura was great and took the time to go the extra mile!, I've been wanting to try this sushi bar-only restaurant for a while now. It's in a more private dining area than the main dining area of Brushstroke, and there's been a lot of hype around this restaurant. Reservations are pretty hard to get for this place right now, and there are only 16 covers a night (two rounds of eight).There was a pretty large selection of fish, and apparently the vast majority of the fish gets shipped from Japan every few days. Everything was really fresh and high quality. Chef Ichimura had the usual choices (tai, saba, otoro, kohada, uni, and so on), but it was nice being able to try kuromutsu (black bluefish), higetara (a type of cod) , shirasu (baby anchovy), and shiraou (icefish).The rice was soft and fluffy, though I like the sushi rice more at a few other places in NYC (like Yasuda). On the negative side, it started off too warm at first before finally getting to a good temperature (just sliiiiiiiightly above room temperature).Anyway, you start off with an appetizer or two (chawanmushi and then some fish/vegetable bite-sized tastings) before trying sashimi, sushi, or a mix of the two. I went sushi-only because I was in a sushi mood. (Then again, I'm usually in a sushi mood...)Positive dishes/pieces:-The anago, akamutsu, kuromutsu, tai, and uni were really good.-The 1dtoro and chutoro were AMAZING. Winter's a good time for toro haha ^_^.Negative dishes/pieces:-The one disappointing part was the tamago, which didn't taste special at all.I had a really good time here, and I thought the meal was really well-priced for what you get. The value to quality and quantity ratio is REALLY good here for sushi! (Chef Ichimura is also REALLY nice. That might have helped haha.)---If you're curious as to how the meal progressed, I have pictures+commentary for each piece in the blog in my profile., A luxurious 2+ hour journey of sushi, sashimi and Ichimura-san's expertise. The winter omakaze was a wonderful ebb and flow of texture, flavor and sensations. The spanish mackeral, golden eye snapper, red snapper, and medium-fatty tuna were particular delights. The rice, served at perfect room temperature. We tasted and savored each piece slowly, appreciating the flavors of the fish and ocean as well as the timing and preparation by Chef Ichimura. Each piece had its own unique trail of flavor - from the first bite, to consumption, to the lingering after-taste. The sea urchin was easily my favorite piece of the evening. It was a cool, eye-opening burst of flavor with an intriguing sweetness and unmistakable freshness to it. I felt like I was swimming in the ocean.What turned an already incredible experience into a truly cherished memory was the personal interaction with Chef Ichimura. After the all of the reviews, the hours of research I did prior to our meal, and the anticipation of a two month reservation, I was a little nervous at the start of the meal. That quickly dissipated as he is an incredibly kind and gracious host. He is quiet and soft-spoken but his friendliness and passion for his work are unmistakable. I only wish I could speak Japanese so as to converse with him in his native tongue. With every piece - from the giant clam, to the yellowtail, to the herring roe, to the bay scallops, he told us where it was from, the family of fish, and other interesting details. He also happily obliged all of our questions, for example:How long did he age a fish for? Anywhere between 5 - 10 days. This is important to draw out the flavor of the fish. If served too early, it would merely be freshness without flavor, according to Ichimura-sanWhy serve the urchin without seaweed, as is typically done? The seaweed, he believes, overpowers the flavors and texture of the urchin.What is his personal favorite? Kohada (Gizzard Shad)Furthermore, it was a special experience just to be able to watch him at work. He is a minimalist in all of his actions. His arms and hands never stray far from his sides and after serving dozens and dozens of pieces to his customers, his work station is spotless! Every time he opened up one of his tins to bring out a fish to prepare was like opening a Christmas present for me. Watching him deftly grate the wasabi was fascinating. The utter efficiency in which he cut and prepared the fish - stunning. The delicate brushstrokes in applying the soy sauce just before serving - mouthwatering. We were lucky enough to establish a very nice rapport with Chef Ichimura and I think he genuinely appreciated all of our questions, interest and gratitude as he provided us with a couple of extra pieces of sushi and a vegetable roll with a raspberry reduction sauce which he said would help digestion. After a long wonderful journey through the ocean and coasts of Japan, I left the restaurant wholly satisfied and curiously refreshed. Dining at Ichimura is an incredible experience - for the mind, eyes, and certainly taste-buds! When you go, please pay attention to how he moves and engage him in some dialogue about your meal, it will make the experience so much more rewarding., What an outstanding experience! I was really looking forward to trying Ichimura-san's sushi bar in Brushstroke. Made a reservation about a month in advance. The omakase is the only option and it is wonderful. This is hard-core pure sushi and sashimi...no rolls or flourishments...simple pieces of fish, with maybe a little soy, tiny bit of shiso, or a few grains of sea salt. All served with freshly grated wasabi the Ichimura-san makes on a cool japanese grater..a real treat. No soup, no hot dishes, no vegetables, and no dessert is included. Had many fish I had never even heard of and found to be delicious. The sashimi served cubed resembling dice was cool. Sushi rice was indeed a bit warm and loose, as others have noted. Sushi is served one piece at a time, and they intend you eat each piece with your hands instead of chopsticks. They give you a towel they want you to use to cleanse your hands in between pieces. The sushi piece fee very small and delicate in your hand, but explode with fresh deliicous flavor in your mouth. We have some wonderful sake from an impressive list.Service was not quite up to the same level as everything else, but not terrible. Too many times I was left waiting for something, but otherwise friendly and warm., One of the best omakazes in town for sure! We were first greeted with chawan mushi/crab/truffles and it was fabulous - probably one of our favorite dishes of the night. Since we are not a fan of uni and ankimo, we opted out of those and the chef substituted with other fishes, such as eel and salmon roe. Sashimi and sushi then followed. Our favorites: chu-toro (I got a second round of it), kohada, akamatsu, mirugai (giant clam), shima-aji. We also ordered a piece of anago sushi which was not part of the omakase per one of the Yelper's review - it was creamy and soft, but I preferred the other fish more., After reading a lovely New York Times review and patiently waiting for two months after making a reservation, J and I were beyond excited when we finally stepped foot in Chef Ichimura's quietly sophisticated omakase sushi bar, located in a separate corner of the main Brushstroke restaurant. Greeting us with a slight bow and warm smile, the soft-spoken and attentive chef was able to give us a bit more personal attention as we were the first diners there. As he asked us about food allergies and made playful jabs after he learned of J's ability to speak Japanese, he started to expertly, quickly, and elegantly prepare our meal. It was quite clear from that moment that we were in for a wonderful dining experience. First came chawanmushi, a luscious steamed egg custard dish, and mine was topped with copious amounts of chunky dungeness crab and truffles. It definitely soothed and warmed us up from that chilly winter's night. Next came a long plate of small zensai such as burdock roots, marinated daikon, herring roe, and monkfish liver. All were presented so beautifully that they looked too pretty to eat, but eat we did for they were all delightful bites of umami. Unfortunately for J, his shellfish allergies prevented him from indulging in a rather generous portion of uni that was presented before me. Not being much of an uni fan, my taste buds were very surprised to encounter the uni served here. Lightly soaked in seawater, it was texturally very smooth and tasted nutty and delicately sweet. And fresh. So incredibly fresh. Isn't it fresh, Chef Ichimura asked. All I could do was nod excitedly for I had realized what all of my other experiences with uni had lacked. Freshness was redefined. Black slated plates carrying wakame, shiso, salt, and a generous dollop of wasabi that the chef had been grating were then placed before us. He gracefully sliced blocks of sashimi and artfully placed them on our black plates making them look even more delectable and vibrant than they already were. We were given heavenly cuts of sashimi such as grouper, snapper, white trevally, mackerel, cod, otoro (fattiest portion of blue fin tuna belly), and chutoro (medium fat). As we consumed these slices, Chef Ichimura continued to deftly slice and place, slice and place...the number of sashimi we had was almost too good to be true. The otoro was the standout as it was served at its peak winter season with slices so buttery they literally melted in our mouths. Having fresh fish meant no garnishes were really necessary, but they did enhance the overall flavor. The wasabi, for example, never overpowered or masked the flavor of the fish; it had an ever-so-slight sweetness and depth to its pungency that complemented the sashimi very well. Chef Ichimura then began to serve us nigiri sushi, as if we needed even more proof of his skills. On top of rice so vinegary and fluffy, he dabbed a bit of wasabi and laid a generous helping of some of the aforementioned fish as well as some aged fish and tamago. This time he even brushed sauce on top of the fish making eating with our hands, in true traditional form, much easier. His keen sense of timing was very apparent that watching him was just as amazing as eating. As our course neared its end, he gave us extra otoro sushi after he noticed how much we loved them. With a twinkle in his eye, he also made me sushi with a delightfully large portion of uni on top. I could not have been more thankful. As we ended our meal with hot green tea, I just couldn't help but smile like a child with an over-sized lollipop. We sipped our teas slowly to savor the moment. We were left mesmerized by the chef's work and noticed with how much precision and passion he worked. We could see it in the way he carefully sliced the fish identically and maneuvered efficiently around his work space. We could see it in the way he enthusiastically explained things to his other customers. This establishment deserves much more than 5 stars. Likelihood of another visit:I would love to visit again. Note: I was apprehensive about writing this review because J's review was far superior and more eloquent, but I just had to write about the unforgettable uni., 'I plotted and waited patiently for a month before coming in here... worth the wait and had a delightful time gorging on sushi and chatting with chef Ichimura. It pricey, yes, but Ie also NEVER seen so much sushi and sashimi in one sitting in my life. And that includes all you can eat sushi boat restaurants. There was a point in the meal when I looked at the bf and said, I don know if I can keep going. So don you worry.. this is not a place youl leave feeling like you didn get your money worth.Even though it omakase, the chef is super happy to accommodate your preferences and allergies. I got almost endless amounts of shima aji because I told him it was my favorite. Red snapper, golden snapper, and fluke were other faves.Anyway, totally blunt opinion: Neta is more up my alley but this place is great for an intimate, traditional sushi night. No pretentiousness at all but they know their fish :)', 'Jiro dreams of sushi...I dream of Ichimura-San. Every bite here is divine. Chef uses the word cookery...everything here is either aged, cured, treated for days to weeks before he masterfully presses them into sashimi/sushi onto your plate. We made a reservation for our next date with Ichimura-San on our way out.', Ichimura comes off as the silent type who quietly prepares your meal as you converse with your friends and new acquaintances. While you enjoy his preparation, he studies your expression and eagerly assembles or slices the next sushi or sashimi. Although he may not say much, know that he appreciates the smiles and simple gestures of enjoyment as he guides you through the experience.Amazing is just a word, and it really it can't describe the food Ichimura serves. The soft taco (octopus), the sweet fresh sake (salmon), the rich buttery toro (fatty tuna)... makes you wish you could afford to have Ichimura serve you breakfast, lunch, dinner, and second dinner for the rest of your life... Everything is prepared in precise strokes, and you can easily see the care that Ichimura and the staff at Brushstroke provide., 'imho, not worth a special trip, let alone a last minute walkin. Limited variety of fish and rice lacked flavor.', I hate to admit it but I'm guilty of being a bit of a sushi snob. I've been spoiled by places like Tokyo's fish market, Yasuda, 15 East, Ushiwakamaru, Sushi of Gari, Azabu...Despite my high standards, I was absolutely blown away by Ichimura's omakase. For those of you who are as obsessed with finding the best omakases as I am, you must put this place on your list. It was absolute perfection. You know how sometimes you walk away from a good meal and you have one, maybe two, things that stays on your mind? Almost EVERYTHING that chef Ichimura served was memorable and beautifully executed. My only criticism is that, after $550 for two people, I left still a bit hungry. We started with a beautiful array of small bites: miniature squid, torched tuna, daikon, and a few others. The squid was my favorite. Not only was it so freakin' adorable since I've never seen such a tiny squid but it was delicious and had an amazing soft texture. Next we had uni on top of fish and I'm a complete sucker for uni so that was amazing as expected. I think it may have been slightly torched because the texture was firmer than usual. There was also a small dish of sushi with some diced greens on top, followed by a light crab soup. And finally, the sashimi. Nothing beats amazing, fresh quality sashimi that makes your eyes roll back in your head as soon as you put it in your mouth. I loved the contrast of the different tastes and textures that Ichimura put together. It was so decadent and just melts.When you make a reservation, make sure it's for Ichimura's omakase--it's different from the brushstroke restaurant. The omakase is in a little room off to the side at 9 person sushi bar. It's a really intimate setting and an amazing experience., I wanted to love this place, I really did. What you get here is 5 star atmosphere, 3.5 star food, and 0 star value. It's a 3.5 star experience all in. We booked reservations 6 weeks in advance for the privilege of one of the eight seats at the sushi bar. The chef explains each dish and as others have said, he is very soft spoken and I found myself not necessarily hearing it all. You start with a few plates of sashimi topped with various goodies. Most pieces were excellent, but there were a couple we could have done without. The next course is a thick soup with black truffle, egg custard, and crab meat. That was excellent. The meal is finished up with about a dozen pieces of sushi, served one piece at a time. The stars for me were the uni, trout, and jackfish. There was some toro served, but it wasn't as melty as I've had elsewhere. Now, the bill. $170 per person for the omakase. Plus alcohol and tax and tip. Now we are closer to $300 a person. For that amount of money, I expect to have my mind blown at every bite, which was sadly not the case. I'd have to recommend Yasuda over this place, where you can get equal or better quality fish for less than half of what you pay here. It just was not worth what it cost., We entered Brushstroke, an expansive restaurant, and after checking in with the hostess, we waited close by. Shortly after, a waitress emerged behind a curtain we hadn't noticed and she took us into this unsuspecting and minimalist side area where we discovered we were the last of the parties to arrive as the other 6 were happily eating their first course.My friend and I were seated front and center. Here we met Chef Ichimura, who is adorable and he has this serene and inviting quality that I can only hope would have been like my grandfathers who I've never had the pleasure of knowing.The first course we had was an array of dishes as well as some bonito sashimi. The most memorable was this uni over daikon that was just a buttery revelation. I don't think I've ever enjoyed uni so much in a dish. We then moved on to a chawanmushi that was divine, silky, and rich with a black truffle and pepper top. The sashimi course was great and really enjoyed the mackerel and bonito but I wasn't surprised that my favorited was the ootoro. We then moved on to the sushi course where Chef Ichimura just kept giving us one after another after another of delicious fresh fish that he coated with his own special soy sauce. At the very end, Chef Ichimura allows you to have one more sushi of anything else you want. I opted for the ootoro (a popular choice during our seating) but I also could have very well chosen the uni. Someone did ask if there was something they didn't have yet and actually got a different fish.A couple during our seating said they had been to Ichimura at Brushstroke before and the meal was very different and still good, which is expected from omakase but that does make me excited and really want to revisit Chef Ichimura again., 'Holy god. Some of the best sushi Ie ever had. Not every bite is mindblowing, but enough of them are such that I not sure I ever want to go to a different sushi place. Ichimura starts with an appetizer of pre-prepared bites while he begins making the sushi, and theye all wonderful, something wrapped in shiso leaf and the toro stood out the most to me, amongst other preparations, all of which taste wonderful, along with another small dish that is marinated, in our case shima-aji with scallion, I think.After that, chawanmushi with dungeness crab, which I found a little too rich (I prefer mine more egg-flavored, but this is more of a preference thing, it was impeccably prepared) and then more sashimi, from Ichimura capable hands - watching him prepare things with precise grace is just as much of an experience as the food is. All of which was excellent, especially the otoro. I liked the clam, surprisingly - Ie never had clam I enjoyed until that day. He serves it with the typical fresh grated wasabi and soy sauce, but also adds a little pile of sea salt you can also choose to use as a garnish, which Ie never had before.And the sushi. Sigh, I loved every piece, but especially the first (some type of whitefish, with a piece of shiso leaf slipped under), the trout, the toro (which was a mix of toro and otoro) and the uni. Oh my god the uni was just a perfect burst of sea in flavor. And past the food, the service was impeccable and Ichimura adorable and I want him as my grandfather (especially if he give me sushi) and just an absolute master at what he does. If you haven already gone, go! It is kind of pricey but ...lucky for me I wasn paying for it :DP.S. Fermented tofu ice cream. (Okinawan tofu-yu with olive oil and kuromitso) sounds crazy, extremely delicious + umami. Couldn get enough. Waitress was nice enough to bring a scoop to me and my boyfriend who were busy debating two other desserts as a sample along with our other desserts...we regretted not getting it. And oy, that service is too good. Friendly, impeccable, without being condescending or overbearing. (And the waitresshair was pretty cool too).', '2 month wait very much worth it. so much fish so delicious but chef speak so soft that I most of the time had no idea what I was eating. I will say just the wasabi is worth the wit he makes it right in front of your eyes and it is so delicious.', I'll start this off by saying I'm not a fan of Brushstroke at all - I had their tasting menu at the end of last year, and I thought it was vastly overvalued and the food was under-executed. But they have an absolute gem of a sushi restaurant with Chef Ichimura, who operates on the other side of the curtain of Brushstroke. Although there appear to be tables that people would sit at, there's a grand total of 9 seats at the sushi bar that are actually utilized. Ichimura himself is very soft-spoken; he'll engage in conversation from time to time, but it usually is in the context of when he is serving you the sashimi and sushi courses. If you know Japanese, that'll probably get you a little more exposure. Although it's very quiet - you're either enjoying each masterful piece of fish, or you're watching him work - you can carry on conversations without having to whisper. Unlike the main restaurant, where service is inattentive and indifferent at best, the waiters at Ichimura are there to make sure you're filled up with water and have your beverages served quickly, as well as removing used plates quickly once they are emptied.It's difficult to remember all the different fish we had, but I can tell you that the quality of the fish - as well as the variety - is top-notch, with nothing ever striking a bad note. You start out with a plate of sashimi cuts with various garnishes; the most interesting ones that I recall right off was some kind of smoked tuna - it falls apart in your mouth, but the flavor is very deep and rich - and the uni, which is actually quite a bit firmer than the kind you'd get served as a piece of sushi. In all, it's a contrast to the rest of the meal, as I feel that Ichimura definitely employs the use of firmer textures for this first serving, but heavily focuses on buttery, rich cuts for most of the sashimi and sushi. The main exception that comes to mind is the cuts of clam, which he dices up as an additional serving during the second sashimi course, and the fluke fin - which has a very smooth texture but is very chewy. Of the sashimi, every piece was delicious, with perhaps the best part being that you get 4(!) pieces of toro sashimi - quite the quantity for a sushi/sashimi omakase dinner. It's not the fattiest or most decadent I've had (the fattiest cut at Azabu is still the winner), but every bite is full of that rich fattiness that makes it a standout favorite. The mackerel was also really good as well; most other sushi restaurants tend to have mackerel that comes on the 'fishier' side, but here, it was very similar to the more succulent cuts of yellowtail or toro that I've had in terms of texture. For the sushi - it gets served one piece at a time, with Ichimura slicing all the fish ahead of time before taking a bundle of rice, a slab of freshly-ground wasabi (he does that in front of you), and forming a perfectly-formed piece of sushi, and putting just the right amount of soy sauce on top before serving it. The rice doesn't stand out to me as much as some other places, but it is more than adequate, and definitely on the upper end. It was hard to pick up all the different cuts we had, but the toro (yes, you get another piece during the sushi round - and he puts 2 thin slices on) was delicious. I really like the stripejack belly piece, which was very succulent as well, but has a different kind of flavor relative to the other fish. At the end, you get served ikura, uni (which is really good quality), anago (which is warmed up beforehand and appears to be the only prepared fish served, outside of the ones that he may have cured), and a piece of tamago. At the end, he then will slice you a piece of sushi of any fish you request - something I've never really encountered on any kind of omakase before. We ended up doing the stripejack belly again given how good it was. In between the sashimi and sushi course, Brushstroke served one of their better dishes (the chawanmushi) as part of the dinner, and you can order a dessert at additional cost at the end (we did the red wine panna cotta).In all, this is truly a sushi experience that's built around one man and his ability to select great fish and give you a phenomenal sushi meal. Given the much more personal and intimate nature relative to my other top spots in NYC (Azabu and 15 East), the experience stands out much more. The flavors here are also interesting and different, which I think is due to the fact that Ichimura ages and cures some of his fish. If you're looking for some of the - if not the absolute - best sushi NYC has to offer, Ichimura is required dining. And considering the price ($150 per person for omakase), it's definitely reasonable given the very sizable number of pieces you are served. I may not be inclined to ever visit the main dining area of Brushstroke again, but I have no doubts I will be coming back here more than once in the future., My husband and I came here to celebrate our anniversary a couple weeks ago. I have to say if you love top-notch sushi, then this is the place for you. Like what you've read from the other reviews, chef Ichimura grated fresh wasabi right in front you and it's got the most delicate flavor I've ever tasted. It is not as spicy as the ones you normally eat at those mediocre Japanese restaurants. It tastes really fresh and sweet. He also put on a show by making all the piece of art sushi right in front of your eyes. My husband was really happy with my choice and ensured me we will be back here soon. However, the only little disappointment is chef Ichimura forgot to serve us the last piece of tamago of the omakase. On that night, I did see the other customers eating at the end of the dinner and I thought it was the last piece they chose to have. Just now I read the other reviews and realized the tamago should be the last piece of sushi of the omakase (excluding the piece of your choice). This is why I am deducting 1 star for this review. Overall it was a very pleasant experience. Btw, they've raised the price to $160/person for omakase., 'I am really concerned I would not be able to enjoy sushi elsewhere any more......I have been to many good Japanese restaurants in the city, 15 East, Azabu, Yashuda, Masa etc. But I had not found any of them can compare to the quality and variety of fish that I had in Tokyo, until last night I was invited to a dinner at Ichimura. My search for the perfect (on the east coast of US) sashimi/sushi ended here. Disclaimer. Friend is a friend of Ichimura san. So we got some special treats that usually not served to regular customers. Being said that, service and food here definitely surpass its peers. The fish was fresh and perfectly seasoned. One thing that sets Ichimura san beyond other traditional edo style sushi places is that he creates and experiments. Aged abalone anyone? Sea pineapple con uni?! During our 3 plus hour dinner, I heard myself said foodgasm more than 3 times!My favorite of the night was Japanese sardine, aged Japanese mackerel, and domestic sea urchin on Japanese sea urchin. Actually, every bite I had was perfect. Picture worth thousand words. Just check out my pictures. Better still, pick up your phone and make your reservation now!', 'We made the reservation a month ahead. We were sushi lovers, so we were expecting great sushi. The restaurant did not disappoint us; it was AMAZING~~~~~ The fish was very fresh!!!! The price was expensive, but it worths it.', $160 omakase. Regular green tea is $8 per person. Desserts are $9 per dessert. 8 seats at the bar. Two small tables in the back. You can tell Eiji Ichimura is extremely passionate about everything from the quality of the fish to the slicing and preparation of the ingredients to the cleanliness and maintenance of the food (the refrigerator behind him was ridiculously organized and clean). I don't remember seeing his level of concentration in cutting each slice of fish and presenting each piece anywhere else. The sushi and sashimi courses here were delicious, especially the toro and oh toro slices. The white fish here was very buttery. The uni was top quality but not as good as Soto. There was one non raw fish course and that was the chawanmushi, which was decent. The desserts (panna cotta and the roasted tea pudding) were delicious but the tea pudding was the winner for sure., 'Omakase ReviewFood:5Service:5Value:4.5Overall:5I was completely blown away. I am an Omakase snob, having dined at 20+ of the 4.0-4.5 star Omakase places in NYC. This place is up there. All the way UP THERE.Make reservations about a week in advance for weekdays, and earlier for weekends. Seatings are at 6:00 and 9:00PM. We had one of our party of four running late (the only lady of course), and the staff was very accommodating, even though she was close to thirty minutes late. Ichimura is a side dining area, located on the right side of Brushstroke, separated by a curtain. The toilets in the bathroom are very advanced. I have video. LOL.$160 for eighteen courses, which is very worth it considering many places serve ten nigiri and a roll for $50-80. The meal began with two sashimi appetizer plates, followed by the best Chuwan-Mushi I ever had (it smelled SO good), then fifteen pieces of nigiri. The two sashimi appetizers were quite ample, totaling about eighteen pieces alone. Edo-Mae Omakase as it should be. Simply, fish on rice, with wasabi inside and soy sauce brushed onto the fish. No extra sauces or fusion-y toppings. Waiters check on you frequently, almost too frequently. Go to Ichimura at Brushstroke. You will not regret it. And maybe Il see you there.---------------------Omakase tips- Rice should be body temperature - so do not complain about rice being too hot- Fish should be room temperature - so do not complain if the chef used the torch to get the fish to room temperature. Also this is why some places put their fish in a wood or metal box sans refrigeration - Eat with your hands or chopsticks. Either method is fine. But try to eat it in one bite, never putting any back on your plate. I try to flip the nigiri so the fish side hits my tongue and taste buds first. It makes a difference.- The nigiri should fall apart once it hits your mouth, that why the rice is sometimes loose. *Reason to eat nigiri with your hands.- Eat each piece as soon as it is served. Fresh from the chef hand to your mouth! That why most Omakase places serve one piece at a time.- Soy sauce should be applied to the fish. At most Omakase now, the chefs brush it on. If you are given soy sauce, do not dunk your rice into it.- Do not rub wooden chopsticks together.- Omakase usually offer around ten nigiri and a hand roll, and can range in price from $45 to $100+. Of course some places serve more and charge more. ($500 for Masa)- If youe complaining that Omakase costs too much or doesn fill you up, maybe it not for you. Go to Key Food and pick up two trays of their sushi for $15. And don forget the soy sauce packets.', As with another commenter below, my reservation was lost. I made it weeks ago, and flew in from Seattle to enjoy an incredible omakase experience for my birthday. I called to confirm the reservation tonight, and was told that it did not exist in the system, so sorry, maybe next week? I will be gone next week, that's why I made the reservation. This is shocking, especially given the service this restaurant ostensibly provides. I know that being denied the opportunity to spend a lot of money to eat raw fish is not exactly a problem in many people's eyes. But that's their business, and making reservations is the most basic part., 'The most delicious sushi ever. A must go!', I finally had the opportunity to dine at Brushstroke, which is the best sushi bar in New York, as far as I'm concerned!The place only has a counter with 6 seats. There's no menu; you're encouraged to ask the sushi chef there and see which fish are the best in season.Read More... tabelog.us/reviewers/dta43_, 'I would give chef Ichimura and his amazing creations 5 stars, but have to take off 1 star for service. We were 5 minutes early for the 6pm seating and were directed to one of the two small awkward tables in front of the bathrooms to wait for the Chef to get ready. We were asked if we were interested in the cocktail menu and declined. One minute later, a waiter in suit came by with the cocktail menu and asked us again if we would like something to drink. And when we told him no, he gave us this contempt look and took the menu away clearly with an attitude. I thought he worked for Brushstroke but turned out he indeed a waiter for Ichimura.Well, it was 6:10pm and no one ever showed us to our table as promised when we first came in. The same suit-waiter guy came by, wanted to take our drinks orders at the counter, but offered no description of the tea options, just barking out names of tea in Japanese as if everyone in the world should know (actually, I not even sure if he knows anything about Japanese cuisine). Some of you may think the service is attentive. While I agree that my water was refilled (by a different waiter) frequently, I think service in general was offered with snob-attitude, not with the kind of genuine hospitality that one would expect from a Japanese establishment. Chef Ichimura, on the other hand, is the most humble, kind, and talented chef Ie ever seen. I would come back if Brushstroke improves their staff/service attitude.', 'I went there last Friday with my boss.First of all I am happy that Mr. Ichimura returned to this sushi world!I was fan of him when he had his store on 54th street but when he closed the store I was so sad. I could say His sushi is the best, no1, most delicious in the united state.too hard to make reservation but you should try!I paid about $800 for Omakase and a bottle of wine, small sake.So happy...', Did I like it? YesDid I love it? Not reallyWas it worth $160? NoChef Ichimura was very nice and gave a brief description of everything we ate, but it just didn't feel that special.The food was good, but definitely not part of my top 5 for sushi. Nothing I tasted was especially memorable. But the way he prepared several pieces looked really special, but the taste just didn't back it up.We had east and west coast uni piled on top of each other, I thought it would be amazing, but after having it, I would have rather had them separately.We also had three different cuts of toro topped on each other, and again, it was a bit of a letdown.I appreciate the technique and creativity, and it was good and I enjoyed my experience, but the food just didn't impress me as much as some other places., While I am serious Yelper, but I do admit that I don't really write reviews a lot. Unless it is something amazingly good or so horrible that i need to let the world know.Ichimura was amazing!! Totally worth the $160 for the 18 courses, between the quality of fish, the presentation, the intimate setting, the opportunity to see Chef Ichimura at work, the amazing 3 layered otoro, a 2 kinds of Uni on a sushi, list goes on!! If you go to any regular restaurant for quality sushi a la cart, it's between $6 to $12, we get 18 pieces, plus the set of variety of sashimi (normally would run $40) at any sushi restaurant, Chawamushi - $10, if you break it down, what you get at Ichimura is amazing value. Not to mentioned the entire experience lasts 3 hours, and an unforgettable evening with someone who share the same love!!It's totally worth it, and I will return!, I hadn't planned on reviewing this place (so many great reviews already!) but my experience at 15 East tonight made me realize just how much better Ichimura at Brushstroke is than the other sushi restaurants out there. Chef Ichimura and the servers here are so attentive, and everything we ate was amazingly delicious. The toro here was especially good--I remember shamelessly asking for more afterward. My only regret is not asking for a piece of tamago sushi (apparently those take years to master, but alas we didn't watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi until after eating here).I would say the only downside to eating here is that we've started to use it as a yardstick against which to compare other, high-end sushi restaurants. And that means that until we can afford to eat here every other week, we'll be eating a lot of expensive yet mediocre meals at other sushi places :(, Got lucky and snagged a reservation this past Sat due to someone's last minute cancellation (his loss!)Chef Ichimura commands the oddly-shaped but serene room on the inside right of Brushstroke. The counter seats 9, and Ichimura is the sole master of his domain.We started with a plate of 4 small appetizers, of which the tiny squid and charred uni stood out. The sashimi was next, of which my favs were the chu-toro and 2 snappers (red and goldeneye). The crab chawanmushi provided an amazing intermission. The broth was rich and the egg delicate and silky. My fav chawanmushi so far in the city.The nigiri wrapped up the omakase. From what I remember:-Japanese uni, fresh and creamy and slightly sweet, and I suspect he added an extra tongue when he saw me practically drooling as he was preparing-Goldeneye snapper, so good!-Needle fish, bonito, mackerel, roe, and saba were solid-Sweet shrimp, a bit too mushy for my liking-Eel, the only cooked piece, warm and flaky, but I'm not a huge fan of eel-Fresh toro, not the creamiest/fattiest I've had, but still good quality-3 slices of aged toro layered together, an amazing finale - so delicious!Dessert is off the Brushstroke menu. We shared the green tea and white chocolate affogato, flecked with a few specks of gold foil. So good!Overall a top-notch experience. I was sad there was no scallop or tamago :( Good sake list. Attentive service, but my serenity was sometimes disrupted when a phantom hand with water/sake suddenly entered my field of vision as I was fixated on Ichimura. I really appreciate that Ichimura does all the work, and he truly is wonderful to watch. All eyes were on him as he carefully slices each fish stroke by stroke. He is rather soft-spoken, so pay attention! Logistics: omakase only starting at $160 with seatings at 6pm and 9pm. Reservations by phone only, and you need to provide a cc to hold your reservation. 2 day cancellation policy., 'After hours of seeking the best omakase, my search ended when i found chef ichimura at Brushstroke.I took my wife here for her birthday and it was nothing short of spectacular! We keep kosher, so chef ichimura easily accommodated us by making the omakase kosher style. From course 1 to 18, my mind was blown at every bite. They fly in fresh fish every single day straight from Japan!! The passion ichimura uses when he slices, garnishes, and sets up each plate is unbelievable.The dinner wasn cheap though, after 2 drinks each, dessert, tax and tip our bill came out to about $250 per person... well worth it though if you want the best.', 'Having been to Brushstroke multiple times, we thought it was time to try the hidden sushi bar on the other side of the restaurant. Can I say it blew my mind??They only have two seatings per night, 6pm and 9pm, and there are 9 or 10 seats at the whole place. Everyone starts at the same time so don be late, the chef doesn wait. Now I won (and don remember) name every course, all I remember was a series of amazing sushi, prepared by the master hand of chef Ichimura. You watch him slice those fresh fish, gently apply fresh wasabi onto the meat, brush on some soy sauce, then carefully place it in your plate. It was like watching an action movie with the title how to make sushi. When you come here, you are not only in it for the sushi, you are in for the whole experience. All I can say is, this is the best sushi Ie had so far in my life, and it worth EVERY penny.', $160 per person. Dining times at 6 or 9pm. Intimate setting for 8 people. Chef Ichimura preps and cuts sushi in front of you. Very traditional sushi, more like Yasuda, no fancy sauces like Gari. Sushi and overall experience ranks up there as top sushi restaurant in NYC but more on the expensive side. Favorite sushi was the 3 layer of toro (toro on toro on toro). You can read the other reviews to see what they serve but a funny observation is as follows: Chef Ichimura describes the fish based on size: very small or very big. That's sufficient since half the time, I'm not sure how the fish actually looks like but as long as I know if it's a big or small fish, I'm content. Also, one last thing: I love the wall made out of books. Look closely at it; it's pretty awesome., 'The best, nothing more to say!', I've been here 3 times now, each time is. Just as amazing as the other. Ichimura At Brushstroke is the kind of sushi place that just lingers in your mind and on your tongue for days and even weeks afterward. I love the set up and how modern everything is.. Food is - So delicious! We saw others order the omakase and otoro, and all seemed to be enjoying. Service is also great as our server was very nice and constantly checked on us. Anyway this is my new favorite sushi spot! Can't wait to go back for Chawanmushi and Sashimi appetizer which I heard is superb!, 'Outrageously good! Chef Ichimura deserves a place in the top 10 sushi chefs in the world. Bonus: yes, his mood is marvelous - a rare thing among legendary sushi chefs. Feel free to break the protocols, ask questions and make jokes with him. He will love it and be even more inspired to prepare sushi that seems to fall straight from heaven. Being very straightforward, it the chef in America that has come closer to the legends os legends, Jiro.', Better than ZO in LA. Better than YASUDA. Chef was clean, fast, skilled, passionate, and awesome. Only downside was cold service from the staff particularly the SOMM. I'd come Back cause the meal was so damn good., Sushi at it's finest - ANYWHERE. You'll see ingredients here you've never encountered, textures that make you want to close your eyes and go mmmmmmm. And we're talking about fish. The mastery of knife skills (imagine baby kohada, multiple slices, each no larger than a dime, assembled like scales on one nigiri sushi), selection of ingedients, to the perfect aging of fish (who would have thought this was even possible or good), smiles abound. My friends and I walked out of the restaurant and probably talked for 30 minutes about how good that experience was. *Definitely* coming back., Perfection. There's a hidden 8 seat sushi bar in the back of brushstroke. Possibly the best omakase of my life. Chef ichimura lovingly cuts and prepares the many many courses of raw and cooked fish right in front of you. Stand outs: EVERYTHING. but if I had to choose: the chawan mushi, toro, uni, and this fermented (?) fish thing. Ugh the stuff of dreams ...If you love sushi skip the hype at sushi nakazawhat and come here., Perfect sushi is a rare and exquisite treat, one I indulge in whenever someone is willing to take me. My mother treated me to dinner at Ichimura, and it was one of the best sushi meals I've ever had, with top quality fish from end to end.Ichimura is a tiny sushi bar tucked into another high-end restaurant (I realize Brushstroke is its own thing, but I haven't been), where the illustrious Chef Ichimura serves omakase sushi to no more than nine customers at a time. The place has a calm, almost temple-like atmosphere--not austere or anything, but something about it commands respect. The decor is minimalist in that pure Japanese way, with a whole lot of smooth blonde wood that cost someone a lot of money. The experience may be quiet and unostentatious, but it is--and I can't really say this without sounding like an asshole--profound. Chef Ichimura has the master's touch. He is also, if this matters to you, a very pleasant, friendly man.Our meal consisted of a handful of appetizer plates followed by a long string of incredible, mouthwatering nigiri. The presentation was straightforward, with each piece of fish standing more or less alone, cut with ultimate care and precision, served over just the right amount of sushi rice. Almost nothing we ate was cooked or embellished, and every morsel had the power to awe. The fish was top, top, top quality, and it was only improved in Ichimura's hands.We started with a row of five bites, consisting of tuna, octopus, uni, herring roe, and crab and caviar on a chip. Then came a sashimi course, featuring toro, striped bass, shimaaji, and giant clam. (I realize my Japanese/English is inconsistent, and it's bothering me too but I'm not going to fix it.) Next was the chawan mushi with crab meat, black truffle, and chives--the farthest departure from pure sushi of the night. All of this was fantastic, and it was just the beginning. The main event was the nigiri parade.I'm going to list the nigiri Pokd9Rap style because honestly, I don't remember every individual piece of fish by flavor and texture. You can bet I wish I did, because every single one was phenomenal. We had: itoyori, suzuki, kinmedai, kasugo tai, aji, isaki, sakuramasu, saba, kuromutsu, kohada, shiroebi, shimaaji, uni, madai, toro, anago, otoro, and finally, good old tamago. It's hard to pick standouts when every bite was so outstanding, but I will say I loved the buttony chew of the shiroebi, and that the uni was among the creamiest I've ever tasted. The toro was maybe the best I've ever had, certainly the best I've had in a long time. I assumed the toro was otoro until the otoro came along and melted right in my mouth. I'll admit I have a harder time differentiating between some of the other pieces of fish in my memory (ebi, uni, mirugai, etc. are always salient to me), but they were no less delicious in the moment.I was sorry when the sushi was over, but I suppose it had to end sometime. My mom and I shared the mirin and soy sauce ice creams for dessert, which came with apple and dried cranberries. The ice cream really did taste like mirin and soy sauce, but the flavors worked. They were interesting and delightful, rather than just plain weird. The dessert was more novelty than centerpiece to this splendid meal, but it was definitely worthwhile.I'd love to come back to Ichimura for another round of omakase paradise. It may be a while, but until then I have plenty of fuel for my sushi dreams., 'Not only is the sushi Super Fresh, but the presentation is amazing! If your lucky, try to reserve the 8 seat spot hidden in the back. An absolute treat! This place definitely lives up to the hype!', 'There no doubt that the sushi and artistry here is near perfection. The respect the restaurant gives their customers, is not. I made reservations for Ichimura about a month ago for three, giving the receptionist my CC # eagerly. After seeing two yelp reviews on here that Ichimura lost the yelpers reservations, I was going to cover my bases. The tuesday before my saturday reservation, I called the establishment to confirm my reservation for three. The man on the phone was incredibly warm and excited for my friends and I. Fast forward to saturday after booking it to Manhattan from Brooklyn, we reach Ichimura only for them to tell me that I cancelled my reservation on wednesday at 8pm. One, why would I cancel a reservation I was looking so forward to? Two, why would I call to double check my reservation the day before only to cancel it the next day? Three, I only told the two girls I was going with that we were going... no one else. So how would someone else have my name and be able to call in knowing the exact time/date/name of the reservation if only three people knew? The management said they had no other information save for the time and day I called to cancel the reservation. To be frank, I pretty sure Ichimura dropped my reservation to accommodate VIP clients, as you could just tell through the glass doors the ten diners looked very important in suits and formal dress. Ultimately, it upsetting because it just plain rude. Of course, there no point in being upset forever and life goes on. The main point is this establishment has no consideration or respect for others and their time.They made reservations for us at Sushi of Gari which ended up being $160 (with tax & tip) per person and the worst omakase us three had ever experienced. Ichimura has lost us and our friends as customers.', 'Having previously dined at Brushstroke we were definitely planning a return to the tucked away sushi counter and a meal with chef Ichimura. The TLDR of it is, the word beautiful keeps popping into my head as the only way to describe the experience, from the quality of the fish to the serene setting. However, for me personally it was about 5-6 too many pieces of nigiri. I sure I wasn alone because the other female diners I observed either didn finish or were falling asleep at the counter in a food coma. Yeah I know, life is hard, being pressured to eat so much amazing sushi. I won ding them for my small appetite though. If you want more details, we had the second seating on a Saturday night. The sushi bar is seperated from the rest of Brushstroke and there is a private room off the back of that. The room itself is really cool- at first the walls look like a rough wood parquet pattern but upon closer inspection it is achieved through paperback books turned inside out. Scattered throughout are tiny shadow boxes depicting Japanese pastoral scenes. Even the pieces of tile and plates the food is served on enhances the experience. I felt the private diners and us at the counter were slighted by Ichimura basically making sushi for 12 people instead of the usual 8 at the counter, and the private party wasn fed piece by piece like those of us at the counter but rather waited and got 4 pieces at a time. The meal started with 5 little bites that didn blow me a away- a too cooked piece of tuna, a chewy octopus suction cup and a few others I didn recall. However that was an outlier because the subsequent sashimi and parade of sushi was definitely some of the best Ie had. This includes most of the big name sushi places in NYC, will have to compare to Japan after we go. I probably coulde done a better job keeping track of the pieces we had, but what surprised me the most was the taste of the seemingly throw-away pieces like mackerels and snappers. They aren usually my favorites but would be if they all tasted like this. The rice was very well formed, flavored, and somewhat warm which brought out the taste in the fish. Ichimura is very soft spoken and whispers the name of each fish while holding his hands up to indicate the size. Useful but not, I guess. What else. Somewhere in there was a fab truffled egg chawanmushi, a welcome break in the raw fish. The somm helped us pick out a great bottle of sake despite our novice status in enjoying it- went based on our description of wines we like, which is a more confident area. I guess when we made the res we mentioned it was for my birthday and they brought out a green tea custard with rose petals and a candle at the end. The hubs still likes Yasuda for his ultimate NYC sushi meal, but I think for a special occasion when you can spend a couple hundred dollars I would steer you to Ichimura!', Wow what a spectacular experience. I came here last Tuesday night for the 9 pm seating. Chef Ichimura greeted everyone (6), was so kind and gracious throughout dinner. Amazing handwork and extremely skillful! I ate many different kinds of sashimi from toro, salmon, tuna, stripe bass, mackeral, golden bass, octopus, uni, squid, and caviar. the staff is very attentive and will constantly clean your spot at the bar and fill your drinks. there cocktail menu was also delicious! I drank the cherry tomato infused with vodka. I'll have to go back for more! Anyways, I was so full by the end of the night there was no room for dessert!, Reservations are required at this Michelin star restaurant. Make sure to request seats at the sushi bar where Chef Eiji Ichimura prepares your food in front of you and serves it to you personally. There are a total of 9 seatings every night at 6pm or 9pm, each lasting 3 hours. The omakase costs $180 per person. Quite hefty but definitely worth the experience. As soon as you walk in, you notice the small and intimate sushi bar. The ambience is quite serene and the decor is minimal but modern. I couldn't help but notice how organized and clean the chef was which is a plus! With the omakase, you begin with a 5 piece appetizer containing tuna, octopus, herring roe, uni, and crab w/ cavier on a chip. Afterwards, you are served a variety of sashimi following a delicious soup consisting of chives, egg custard, black truffles, and dungenous crabmeat. They all tasted superb! Then, the 17 nigiri course followed. His offering changes depending on the quality and season of the fish. I don't quite remember all of the names but every piece he served us was perfectly prepared and presented. The highlights for me were the triple layer aged toro, uni, mackerel, stripped bass, and the golden snapper. They were so tender and fresh that it literally melts in your mouth. The freshness and texture of the fish was definitely top notch. My only complaint is that Chef Eiji Ichimura is too soft spoken. There were times where I couldn't hear what was being served or described and had to ask my partner. The service was very attentive. I told them prior when I made the reservation that it was my boyfriend's birthday so they provided us with a complimentary special dessert with a candle. It was a roasted green tea custard sprinkled with gold flakes. This tasted amazing!! This place is definitely worth a try. I had an absolutely great experience. It costs an arm and a leg to dine here on a regular. However, it is a great place for a special occasion. Overall, I would highly recommend Ichimura at Brushstroke to anyone who truly loves sushi. FIVE STARS!!, 'Disclaimer: I not a super taster; I haven attended all the must-try omakase restaurants in New York or even in the US.My friend and I recently came here after going to Sushi Nakazawa and Gari. The courses at the beginning with small bites of different fish were great. There was a soba chip with golden crab that was interesting, and also a bite-sized cube of uni that tasted good. Subsequently, we had essentially everything else that has been mentioned elsewhere. We ended up finishing up the meal by trying the Mirin ice cream with dried cranberries, and the Green Tea ice cream.Back to my super-taster deficiency - my friend and I agreed that although everything tasted fairly good for the most part, we couldn see what made it better than other places wee had. The dessert is also stereotypically of the high-end restaurant variety. You get a pequeno-sized scoop of ice cream - just enough to taste a flavor. All in all it was a good experience, but not enough for hyperbole.', 'I can be very picky with sushi and been to all the major places including Yasuda, Gari etc. And think Ichimura is by far the best. Highly recommend omakase here.', This is as good as it gets, no frills amazing fresh sushi. They get shipments every day from two different markets in Japan, on alternating days. Chef Ichimura does all the preparation right in front of you. You really couldn't get any better sushi if you went to the top sushi bars in Tokyo.They have an excellent sake list and the sommelier definitely knows his stuff so you can't go wrong here. Though we did end up spending more on sake than food, which is wild considering your only choice is a $180pp Omakase.It is expensive, and you can get fish just as good over at Kura while avoiding the nastiness that is TriBeCa at the same time. Not knocking them, the food here is amazing, just that I think you can get a better value elsewhere., 'I live right around the corner from here. Best sushi in NYC in my opinion! The uni is the best I have ever tried. A little tough to get in, but it is soooo worth it.', Food was great and Chef Ichimura looks to take his job very seriously.Yet, there wasn't really any sparkle of brilliance that I expected. There was way too much white fish and not enough of other varieties in my opinion. However one thing I have to say is that the fish quality here is really good and the bonito is the best that I've had (yes it outdoes the smoked bonito at Nakazawa and I'm a big fan of smoky flavors). Rice is good also, but the atmosphere is a bit uptight.The waiters just take your plate after the omakase finishes so you cannot do additional a la carte orders afterwards. Oh well., What a delightful evening. Our anticipation of Chef Ichimura's two seatings per night omakase created such high expectations that I wasn't sure if it would live up to the hype. Fortunately, the quality of fish and care in preparation was more than enough to create a stellar experience. I was impressed by the chef's one man show. It is always enjoyable to be taken under the wing of a wonderful sushi chef. He is such a quiet, humble and pleasant man and patiently answered our questions despite the pressure of a schedule to keep and a second seating to follow.From the opening appetizer tray with it's tantalizing bites of different tastes and textures to the simple sashimi and wonderful nigiri items, we were treated to fantastic flavors. The chawanmushi was beautiful with sweet crab and truffles. Best I have ever had. Enjoying the same items at the same time with our fellow diners created a sense of camaraderie as well, and we struck up some fun conversation as the night moved along. As an interesting aside, one of the couples dining with us were frequent customers, and early in the meal they were summoned quietly away from the dining area to the room adjacent to us. We heard them saying in hushed tones to the hulking man sitting by himself back there what big fans they were and how much they had enjoyed watching him play. It turned out Hideki Matsui was getting his take-out fix of sushi from Chef Ichimura, and the staff had ushered him in through the side door.Was it my favorite sushi of all time? I can't say that because sometimes magic emerges when you least expect it, and trying to construct it or plan it doesn't always work. Still, Chef Ichimura's decades of refining and planning flavors mean a lot, and many of the moments and tastes were truly beautiful., 'There is not much else to say about Ichimura that hasn already been said. Before September 25, 2012, Chef Eji Ichimura 8 seat spot hid in relative anonymity within David Bouley Brushstroke restaurant. Then Pete Wells gave Ichimura 3 stars in the New York Times and reservations became more difficult than finding a cyclist who stops at a red light. I was fortunate to get a last minute reservation at one of the 8 spots at the sushi bar for the second seating, and was extremely surprised that Ichimura lived up to the hype. 436If youe read the Essentials part of my blog (thesushilegend.com), youl know that one of my favourite hallmarks of a great sushi restaurant is remaining somewhat hidden. There is a sushi bar at Brushstroke by David Bouley, but Ichimura is different; it is off to the side, through a small opening. The sushi bar is small, with veteran sushi chef Eiji Ichimura dishing out his omakase to 8 people at once. There is only waiter attending to the patrons at Ichimura, and for all intents and purposes, Ichimura is completely isolated from Brushstroke (rest is posted on the blog).', I think I paid for the fish airplane ticket outta Japan. Price point a bit high ?...yes, any surprises ?...no. Fish fresh ?...mos def. Ichimura...gentle as can be, can hardly hear him. I wonder if jiro's movie inspired brushstroke to make this move splitting the room in half, and adding ichimura. I certainly enjoy brushstroke main dining room's keiseki experience much more at $200 a pop.|2
22|jean-georges-new-york|'This is absobloodylutely my favorite restaurant, and probably the only tasteful thing in the Trump International Tower. Everything is delicious all the time. Service is spot on. I was a bit skeptical about the foie gras with strawberries, but it was beyond amazing. Terrace seating on a nice day is a more casual dining experience.', 'Ie been to a lot of classy restaurants, but this one trumps (if youe in the know, then youl understand the genius of this pun) them all. This is one of those restaurants that you see in movies where everything is overpriced, the portions are small, and the waitstaff shake their heads and roll their eyes when you don act sophisticated. You enter the place and you immediately see a whole other class of society. You see all the steroetypical rich people. The young stockbroker who thinks he too cool for school, the ugly but rich guy with a hot girl sitting with him, the business lunch, ... This may all seem negative, but in actuality, I liked the place. The food is great. The crouton with a 1/1000 ounce of caviar on it was pretty good i think. The desert was also really good. The waitstaff is attentive, but not overly friendly, although they are less patient if you look like you don belong in a restaurant like that. It probably because the French are a-holes, but regardless its defintely an experience that everyone should try at least once.', 'Preet says it best. Absobloodylutely my favorite restaurant.I went to Jean-Georges, and my life changed. It was amazingly incredibly unbelieveable. The portions were perfect, and the service was professional and gracious without being unaccessible. I had two dishes off of the tasting menu that day: a lobster with lychee and the veal, which was crazy awesome good. And, yes, I had veal. After having eaten Thumper at Gramercy Tavern, you wouldn expect me to think twice about eating the rest of the Golden Books Farm Animals, would you? I chose the Exoticdessert option, which was a pineapple cake and a fluffy, meringue-y, sorbet-y, I-have-no-clue-what-it-was-but-it-tasted-good coconut-shaped thing.Without a doubt my favorite place this summer.', 'Excellent food. My wife and I love the way he combined various flavors throughout every course. The desserts are incredible. One of the best restaurants wee been to. Only thing that was bothersome is that you always get some random person loudly stating how awesome the food is, HMMMM..... darling, is this not the best lobster you have ever tasted? Yummy!... Stop. Please just stop.', When-very very special occasions-you would like to meet Jean Georges (yes, he actually mans the kitchen here on most nights)-you want to see and taste creativityNot when-you don't have $500 to spare (for two)-are wearing jeans and sneakersPlaces like this must be saved for a real special occasion, as it is hard to be topped. JG's dishes leans on the minimalist side, but very creative in the ingredients chosen and his accompanying sauces is what separates him from other celeb chefs. The decor is also very minimalist, modern with huge windows looking out to Columbus Circle. Service was excellent in that they were professional and their overall presence was not noticeable but the second you needed something they were there. The wine list was extensive, relying on the waiter's recommendation we had one of the most memorable wines to date. The restaurant is not as big as one would imagine - so the proximity to your neighboring diners are some what close. Long story short, like any work of art you must go and absorb it for yourself., This place is nuts. I honestly think my dinner there with my parents last night was the best meal I have ever had in my life. I would suggest fasting for at least a day before, however, there was so much food that I was horrified to find that I could not finish either my main course or the spectacular dessert! For interested parties, here's a brief rundown of the meal. Amuse bouche included a carrot soup with a tart mango foam (usually I hate foam, but it worked here), a strawberry with blue cheese that was an incredible flavor combo, and a delicious sliver of raw salmon. Started with hamachi tartare with grapefruit sorbet, I would eat the sorbet by the gallon if they sold it. Fried soft shell crab with pickled lettuce was crunchy and sweet with a really nice tang from the pickling. Beef tenderloin was perfectly done and so tender that it almost melted in your mouth, to use a cliche. They do a really great job with contrasting flavors and textures in a way that I never think to try at home. The rhubarb dessert plate was incredible, especially a little buttermilk pancake topped with a rhubarb compote. The dining room is beautiful, eavesdropping on random dinner conversations is entertaining in a way that it can only be in insanely upscale NY restaurants. Here's my only (really random) complaint; there is only one stall in the ladies' bathroom! How is that possible in a restaurant where the cheapest thing you can get is $95 a head? Maybe the Trump Tower rent is too steep to afford another loo. :), I was a broke bitch living in Brooklyn and slaving away for the college that owns most of Manhattan. I had the best super-long-bad-employee lunch of my life at Jean Georges. $20 felt like $200. Poor foodies can make it happen (at lunch). Try not to get fired for it, though it's truly worth it. You can always find another crappy job. Jean Georges is forever., For business lunches, it's the cat's ass. But for a romantic dinner, something is missing. The overall space is a little rigid and old-fashioned. The food was great but the vegetarian options were not entirely memorable., 'Nothing in New York compares, it is spectacular food and service and immaculate dining experience. The white asparagus soup I had was truly the most memorable thing to ever cross my palate, with so much complexity, flavor and delicacy. The chocolate tasting menu dessert is wildly rich and delightful and bordering on erotic it so shivery delicious. And, how could you not be completely thrilled with a place that makes their own homemade marshmallows in flavors like green tea, red bean and tangerine and wheels them to your table at the end of a 3-hour feasting extravaganza and lightly clips them from a jar onto little plates. It simply exquisite....', 'Hands down 5 stars. The food was perfect - I think this is the first time that I actually can think of anything they could have done better with the food. The portion size was amazing for a tasting menu (4-5 sea scallops in one dish, a huge lobster tail, 2.5 piece of venison - length not width) The presentation of each dish was very unique and detailed, like a work of art, seriously! (order the seared foie gras and youl see what i mean)The service was also top notch. They were very friendly, not stuck up at all. Everything was very choreographed and precise, but still personable enough. Its also great to people-watch. Some ppl on dates, lots of business men on company dinners, and a handful of european looking older couples with fur coats and diamonds. It was awesome. My new favorite restaurant of all time!! =)', 'Update: 3/12:You really can beat Jean-Georges for perfectly prepared incredible food, utterly flawless service, elegance, sophistication, beauty. Jean-Georges has it all. Besides the favorite dish of my life (down below), Ie now relished the other best dish of my life: Smoked Squab a lrange with Asian Pear and Candied Tamarind. The Raw Diver Scallops with Black Truffles.....outstanding. The Hamachi Carpaccio with pink grapefruit sorbet, Cilantro and Chili....so perfectly composed and delicious. The Pan Roasted Sweetbreads with glazed chestnuts and Black truffle vinaigrette. I think I nearly died over that one right there. The Foie gras wontons with green apple cracklings and smokey froth...divine. Desserts, again, sooooo creative and exciting. My favorite again was teh Chestnut sugar tart. loved the Granny smith sorbet with quince and quinoa, and really loved the squash ice cream with pumpkins seeds. Also the Brioche and Gianduja with fontina and black olive (wow!) and the chocolate donut. Thank You so much to every one at Jean-Georges for making both my experiences so phenomenal. Jean Georges goes far beyond 5 Stars. If you are looking for the true fine dining experience, and you want to feel like royalty, and you want to drop a lot of cash, do it here and you won be disappointed. It is utter perfection and it was the BEST meal we have had in NYC, without a doubt.I had one of the best dishes of my WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE here: Duck Breast Topped with Cracked Jordan Almonds and Honey wine jus.Also outstanding would be every single dish we had: the famous Egg Caviar, the Foie Gras Brule, the Turbot in Chateau Chalon Sauce, the Pan Roasted Sweetbreads with Licorice, Grilled Pear and Lemon. , the Loin of Lamb with Black Trumpets and Baby Leeks. The Pastry Chef, Johnny Iuzzini is very famous for a very good reason. Desserts were splendid. We got the Autumn Tasting (um um Chestnut sugar tart) and the Chocolate Tasting (favorite: Milk chocolate peanut cake with salted caramel ic.)Super elegant dining room with views out onto Columbus Circle with PERFECT service. The Wine list is very expensive, but so what.....it was all worth it.', 'hands down..fabulous, classy, rich..in the heart of NY by Central Park....Fantastic!! Bring plenty of dough and your nose up in the air....and indulge!!!', Foods were good, service was good, atmosphere was good. But nothing was more than that. Nothing was special nor impressive. I don't think it's worth paying $200., 'Good but not as amazing as I had hoped. The restaurant itself has a nice ambience but the overall decor seems a bit little early 90 to me? However, I do like the view of Central Park, the giant windows in front and the open kitchen.I ordered the prix fixe meal which included a salad with romaine hearts, mango, goat cheese and mint, an entree of slow baked salmon w/ beets, cous cous and horseradish (the horseradish seemed like an afterthought) and a cranberry clafoutis. The best dish of the three was definitely the dessert. The other two were good but rather uninspiring. My date ordered a roasted chicken dish w/ mushroom ravioli which was tastier than my salmon. I couldn help but notice that the staff seemed quite confused when they would bring the dishes out. They served the wrong dishes to the table of two next to us and it just seemed like the lunch staff was not the A team if you know what I mean.', 'The cuisine is good, the place is over-rated though. There are lots of great places in the city but I would think a name like J.G. would provide a better menu. The atmosphere is cold and the only time I had fun is when a crazy guy pretended to be a famous blues singer and made us take numerous pictures of him. The positives would be that you get to walk under that famous gold globe at the trump bldg. and its close to the subway.', 'How in the world did I, a lowly mktg coordinator, afford dinner at Jean Georges, you ask? I must profess my love for the IN NYC American Express card. I earn points by spending money and redeem them for gift certificates to fancy restaurants! Sure I could be earning airline miles, but who needs to fly around when you can eat? Just kidding (kind of)... I have a miles credit card too.Ok, back to the subject at hand. Jean Georges is pretty fabulous. The thing is, I try to only eat at good restaurants because I hate spending money on bad food (these last few weeks excepted... 2 awful meals in 2 weeks!), so I feel a bit spoiled. Eating in solid restaurants like Town, Cafe Boulud, Gary Danko & Myth in SF (Myth is phenomenal, by the way), sometimes I feel like it hard to be blown away by the four star (or five or three, depending on your ratings guide) experience. Jean Georges did it best to blow me away and perhaps it wasn my favorite dining experience ever, but it was pretty darn good. They sat us at a little table set into the wall. Kind of odd to sit side by side, but also fun for people watching. Yes, probably a bad table reserved for a poor-looking couple, but hey, wee not complainers. We started with the scallops with caper raisin emulsion. Perfectly cooked, what else can you say? More exciting was the peeky toe crab salad. Cold, fresh, slightly sweet. It been so long I can remember if it was coriander, cumin or saffron that tasted sooooo good in the salad. Il just have to go back & retaste.Second course was the mushroom tea (incredibly flavorful mushroom broth, though I had to restrain myself from eating all of the mushrooms since technically my boyfriend ordered this dish) and turbot with chateau salon sauce. I ordered the turbot at our waiter strong instance (a solicited recommendation, of course... the waitstaff was nothing if not perfectly polite, though they made me a bit nervous with the constant attention). She led me right, the sauce was incredible, the fish stunning. Third course was black sea bass crusted in seeds & nuts and arctic char. Both were perfectly cooked, the meat flaking without crumbling, the sauces complementing. I had kind of hoped for a crunchier crust around the sea bass, but hey, it the chef vision & he achieved it well. Desserts were ok. I love cake, chocolate, mocha, and buttercream. They did not consist of these things and therefore I was not in heaven. We ordered winter & late harvest. Grilled fruits are fine, just not a died-and-gone-to-heaven dessert. But that me. And everything was well executed, so I can really complain. Il just go visit Baked for some cupcakes on my own!', If you can't get hot sex, eat at Jean Georges and always be satisfied! LOLI have finally experienced dining perfection. All the senses were pleased-smell, taste, sight, sound and feel. The sauces used on the dishes were exploding with flavor, The aromas were heavenly, the service was relaxed, but it was like they had ESP.- if we thought it-it was there. We spent a leisurely 3 hours in culinary heaven (dinner). Lovely jazz music playing very softly in the background, We were as comfortable as eating at home. The best 4 star experience of my lifetime.I have been here twice. Lunch and Dinner. This dining room is nice at night with all the bright lights from the surrounding buildings shining in. But this room is most beautiful during the day. ( I met Jean Georges. I would have never known he was the multi millionaire owner. He was humble, sweet and very engaged in our conversation. He actually cared and asked my opinions on his restaurants. )The new dining room put in (Sept 07) is beautiful. Much softer and cozy. The elegance of the room was not sacrificed., Had an absolutely delightful lunch here. The service is the best I've ever experience and I'm not sure how to explain it - it is like sorcery - they know what you want and don't want before you do. The food was excellent and the entire experience still exceeded my high expectations., 'Good Evening, Ladies and Gentlemen, Welcome to Jean Georges! If I may guide you all through our extensive menu options - we have the Pre-fixe dinner menu, the seasonal menu, and the Jean Georges menu that has remained unchanged for hundreds of years. Our specials tonight include a smooth, silky...with ....foam, truffles flown in just today that I highly, highly recommend in two distinct....one an airy....succulent.... feel ... melange of flavors....exploding...the other.... nuanced... aroma. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. I hope you will have a great time.As the server left our table with that enthusiastic introduction, the six of us sat dumbfounded, staring quietly at the menus in front of us.As I hold back the saliva, and imagine that the rest are also going through the same state of inner turmoil, I blurt out: Ok, what the hell happened just now? Wee the definitive foodies, Wee been to Bouley, Boulud etc., why am I feeling like a complete fool right now? Why can I think straight? I couldn even listen properly to what he was sayingTo which, a friend responds, You know, for the life of me I can figure out! I need a pen to mark through the options on the menu, and then select through a process of elimination. Looking at these options and food descriptions, and with his words still ringing in my ears, I just can think straight.I respond, Ok, so we must let the left brain take over now. Let start reading aloud what these options are and what they could be like. As we start hearing our own voices, things may become clearer.That the magic of Jean Georges! People talk about food that appeals to all five senses, Jean Georges actually delivers that experience. From the intense aromas (I still remember the truffle...ooh Ie never remembered a non-dessert food item like I remember their truffle!), to the passionate description of the dish, from the nuances of the arctic char to the textures of the egg caviar, the explosive scent intensity of the various broth items to the smoky froth that lightens the foie gras... There no blending in, but flourishes, big and small, that all vie to grab your attention.In case you chose not to go with tradition (the centuries old menu) I strongly recommend to go with the server recommendations. Also, the sommelier is extremely knowledgeable and made an excellent suggestion on a Chateauneuf-du-Pape Reserve 2003 from Rhone.As we got to my favorite part of the meal, I looked at the available options which amounted to dessert-within-a-dessert: one could go with a theme (Chocolate, Citrus, Late Harvest, and Winter) and in that theme one would get 4 different desserts. Obviously, chocolate intrigued me (Molten Chocolate cake with Vanilla bean; Granite, coffee-cardamom meringue; milk chocolate Peanut cake with salted caramel ice cream; white chocolate with mint yuzu and pink peppered sable). BUT, hold on, there a problem: I don eat white chocolate... period. So, I request if I may replace that with another chocolate option in the citrus category. Surprisingly, the server says that it cannot be done. However, I am in no mood to take no for an answer. I beckon him and inquire, Have you heard the Cinderella story? He responds (somewhat bemused), Yes, sir. Me: So, you obviously know about Cinderella, her plain looking step sisters and the ugly, wicked witch. He: Excuse me, sir... but there no wicked witch in Cinderella, just a fairy godmother. You are mixing up Cinderella with Snow White. Me: Precisely: if dark chocolate is Cinderella, and milk chocolate is the plain step sister, then white chocolate is the witch that has nothing to do with the story. So, you see, my point is: White chocolate isn chocolate! He (by now smiling broadly): that persuasive enough for me, sir. Il see what I can do. Though for a moment, I was wondering about the potency of those Rhone Valley grapes.At least, that how I remember the story..for he did end up substituting the white chocolate dessert. But, I must confess all of the desserts were extremely complex versions and full marks to the pastry chef.At this, a friend marveled at my passion for dessert, despite the extravagant meal. So, I shared my philosophy on desserts in easily understood terms (and seek your indulgence for the same): the process of pleasure is similar to that in sex. You have to get in the mood by talking about it, anticipation creates the excitement, it is important in its own right (as opposed to compensating for a bad day at work), one must build up appropriately (as opposed to immediate gratification as a sugar fix), you need to relax and savor the complete experience. And, the ONLY thing which should make you feel guilty is - if you give of yourself fully on the first date. Unless, of course, it true love! ;-))', Oh, what a glorious dining experience! I have found foodie-heaven and it's just a short red-eye away. I'm glad it's not in SF or I may eat here every week and be a giant porker because of it. It really doesn't matter what I ate right? Just read all the other reviews, it's fantastic. I'm just joining the ranks and adding my vote in to confirm it's insurmountable awesomeness. Dress well, take your time eating, enjoy the experience. Looking forward to my next visit to NYC., 'Close to the best meal I ever had. An old boss took me there a couple of years ago to celebrate my promotion. He is a foodie, I am a foodie and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and our palates were in heaven', 'This place is the bombs. Many bombs. Foie Gras Brulee starter + Short Rib entree = most bang for buck. TRUST ME.', 'This place was AMAZING. I went for lunch on a Friday and the whole experience was phenomenal. Our server was probably the best I have ever had. She was helpful and attentive but not pushy or annoying. I chose the prix-fixe lunch from which I had:the cucumber/melon soup, the fried chicken and the chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream.AMAZING. I also tried some of the Shrimp and Salmon from the prix-fixed menu (equally amazing)The wine list was very good and I had a moderately priced glass of Trousseau 2005 Arbois. I highly recommend eating here, but be prepared to pay. My co-worker and I both had 1 glass of wine with our lunches and the bill was over $100.', 'A meal at Jean Georges was going to be the meal of all meals. I knew this was big but I never imagined how big this experience could possibly get. I had reserved a spot in the Main Dining Room for lunch, which I felt would give me the most brilliant experience overall. Fortunately, I was also given the best table in the house in my opinion...the corner table overlooking the whole room. It couldn have turned out better. It was perfect.The moment I was brought to my table, I was pampered like a princess. Such flawless service, it was like a symphony perfectly orchestrated to produce the most beautiful experience possible. The floor managers, the servers, the busboys...all worked in harmony with nothing but a glance to each other. Not a word spoken. The mood at times can be interpreted as somewhat stiff and pompous, but everyone was doing a fine job keeping everything running superbly smooth, so this was graciously appreciated. Hands down, the best service in a restaurant period.As I sat down, the floor manager brought me my requested libation...the Gewurstraminer Grape Juice. I know, ordering juice at a fine establishment like this?!? Indeed it was only 12:30 and I had drinks planned for later that evening and did not want to be passing out while walking the streets of NYC. I shall save my narcoleptic episodes to amuse the children and grandpas another day. Once again, I digress... The juice was amazing. Floral and lightly sweetened, it was like a taste of springtime in each sip. Beautiful prelude to the meal ahead.The meal began with the Amuse Bouche, a rectangular plate adorned with three separate items: Salmon Tartare and Roe, perfectly seasoned atop Garlic Crostini, Warm Parsley Soup sipped slowly only to be spectacularly surprised by the intense Lime Gelee hidden at the bottom of the thimble bowl, and a spoonful of Blood Orange Segments hidden by shavings of a hard cheese (name escapes me) and topped with a leaf of Tarragon. An absolute incredible tease of the palate. I was smittened.My first entree was the Arctic Char roasted to perfection. Piping hot yet still medium rare and succulently moist inside, brown and salty on the outside, and topped with a piece of cracklinskin...ooh, the fish was amazing. The fish was served with King Oyster Mushrooms, Jalapeno, and garlic steeped in a tart citrus vinaigrette and spooned onto the fish by the waiter tableside. Beautiful presentation and service. Second entree was the Roasted and Smoke Squab a Lrange, served with medallions of Asian Pear and tiny wedges of Tamarind Candy. The squab was barely bathed in a sauce of anise and sesame oil vinaigrette, which poured tableside, immediately sent out a release of aroma that teased your senses. Indeed, it was a visual and olfactory feast. The squab was exquisite. The skin, perfectly crisp and seasoned, appropriately complimented the medium rare flesh hidden underneath. Drippingly moist and tender, Ie never enjoyed a game bird more than I had at that moment. This is truly the best dish of the meal.Dessert had four options to choose from: Citrus, Rhubarb, Spring, and Chocolate. I had chosen the Citrus plate. My rectangular plate came with two different desserts, each set on either side of the plate. The first was a parfait layered with Lemongrass Sorbet, topped with Candied Grapefruit, Crispy Tangerine Merengues, and Lemon Curd. The other dessert was a thin chocolate cake shell filled with Lemon Curd and topped with a Hot Chocolate Foam, served over an Earl Grey Tea Caramel and a dusting of crumbled cookies. Everything from hot to cold, sweet to bitter, crunchy to soft was experienced in harmony on this plate. It was indeed a complex and very enlightening lesson for the palate. Damn, it was good.To think that Ie eaten enough for my small frame, there was still more to come. The meal ended with Petit Fours...wee not talking about a little plate with a few cookies; wee talking about plates of different items of sweets to leave a memorable lasting impression. First came pieces of Chocolate truffles served on a rectangular glass plate. Each chocolate was filled with a different ingredient: Green Tea Ganache, Cinammon, Coconut, and my favorite, Banana Cream. Second plate was hand cut, homemade marshmellows: Expresso, Strawberry, Vanilla. Third plate held the Macaroons: Pistachio, Strawberry, and Vanilla. Everything was delicious but my favorite had to be the Macaroons...crispy and filled with flavored cream, it was, dare I say it, Yummy! A perfect meal on a perfect day, there was indeed nothing more I could have wanted. Life was good', After seeing that this was one of only a handful of places to get the coveted 3 stars from the michelin guide I had to see what the deal was. The place is kind of uppidity, but they really take pride in their menu. Once I got past the pretentiousness of it all, I started to feel more comfortable and once i tried the first course i was in all the way. I've been to a lot of great restaurants claiming to have the best of the best and I usually don't buy the hype, but this one lived up to everything I had heard.The best thing to do is order one of the chef's chosen multi-course meals and then chew slowly and try to appreciate the time that is put into each of these dishes. Good work Jean... you are my hero., 'I have been dining out at fancy lunches like, every day for the past two weeks. Boo hoo, poor me. But seriously, Ie gotten sick of fancy food, and was starting to worry I might not like it anymore. Then my six courses at Jean Georges yesterday restored my faith in high-end dining. The menu is comprised of plates, ordered from lightest to richest. You are to order at least two for a lunch, but the server recommends you order three, telling you the portions are small. Actually, I didn think the portions were particularly small, with the exception of the teeny tiny desserts, but I did NOT regret ordering three.First came a vegetarian amuse bouche, possibly because the server noted our dietary restrictions when we placed our order. There was a little drink involving fennel, an adorable little spring roll, and a tiny salad with cherry tomatoes. I began the meal with the rare tuna in a ginger broth with avocado mousse; the tuna was cut like very thick noodles and delicious. Next came a pea soup with carrot tofu and some kind of herb served tempura on the side. Finally, a nut-crusted black bass in a mushroom broth. I had three courses that were soaking in something delicious, and the flavors were explosive and unbelievable. (Note to vegetarians: I am told Jean-Georges will accommodate if you call in advance).Dessert was lovely - I ordered the famous chocolate molten center cake, which came with a bite-sized chocolate panini. And, of course, they provide you with additional chocolates and freshly snipped marshmallows to send you off.Plate presentation was impeccable, as was service. The square-jawed, high cheekboned hostess was the picture of snooty sophistication. If this chick treats me with respect, Ie really made it!Jean Georges--because sometimes the hype is legit.', 'Jean-Georges is lovely. The food is wonderful and the ambiance is gorgeous! I was visiting Manhattan for the first time and my friend made us reservations for brunch. I had the eggs benedict and they were awesome. - I posted a photo.I would highly recommend this place to anyone!', 'i not one for fancy dining. i am more than happy to get great food at some hole in the wall but i was recently taken to Jean-Georges to celebrate a special occasion and all i can say is, HOLY SHIT!every single thing about this place was on point. the service was unparalleled...there were several people making sure everything was perfect and they didn miss a beat. the young lady that explained our dishes was very down to earth and made us feel at home even though we were a couple of novices when it comes to the fancy stuff. her suggestions on (not to mention meticulous knowledge of) the wine list were great. the wine list is so large that it actually has a couple pages as the table of contents.we each got one of the 7 course meals and the food is beyond description. every dish was creative and exciting and the tastes were unbelievable. the dishes that i liked the least were still amazing. i can see why Jean Georges Vongerichten is arguably the best chef in the world. an added treat is that they finish many of the dishes right there at the table in front of you while explaining the dish.i can only offer a negative on one thing: the music was way too low to hear it at all. i would have preferred it to be a bit louder. oh yeah and the bill cost more than some might pay for rent so be prepared to shell out some dough. in fact, the highest price range rating on Yelp of 4 dollar signs is classified as Splurge, over $60 per person. all i can sa to that is HAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! for Jean-Georges wel need a new one with about 17 dollar signs.$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$too expensive to eat at regularly. if youe someone that could afford to, i hate you anyway. but this place was great for a very special occasion and i enjoyed the experience thoroughly.', This place is one of those places that make other restaurants look like poo. Maybe not, but that's how good this place is. Everything is perfect. I went here for dinner and everything was amazing. I didn't know food could LOOK that pretty. I almost didn't want to touch it and ruin the creations...but good thing I did! My mouth was hurting because things were so delicious and unique. (And that's a good feeling- trust me.) This place was seriously a treat, and if I wasn't a broke college student I would go to this place more often., 'Yeah, this is one of those once-in-a-lifetime sort of experiences...like dining at The French Laundry. Yes, youl likely break the bank. And no, you won regret it. As you would expect, the entire dining experience had the attention to detail and focus on quality that simply raises the standard for all other luxury dining establishments. And hey! Two lobster courses! Yippee!', A friend from college invited me out to dinner recently and we decided to check out Jean-Georges in the Trump Tower at Columbus Circle. We both decided on the tasting menu ($68/person for dinner), which allowed us to sample a little bit of everything. We started out with a treat from the chef, which was a piece of shrimp with a mint pesto on top paired with a mango soup.The shrimp was cooked JUST right - like it had just been dipped in hot water and then taken out so it wasn't overcooked. It went really nicely with the mint pesto, which felt like you were cleaning your mouth AND eating food at the same time! The mango soup was tasty, but tasted kind of like juice...a small portion of juice. I'm not quite sure why Jean Georges thought the shrimp and the mango juice paired well together.Next, we had a champagne mango and goat cheese salad with black olive and micro basil. This was actually my favorite course of the night. The mangoes were sweet but not too sweet (good thinking of soaking the mangoes in champagne) and the goat cheese was so incredibly creamy it melted in your mouth. The basil was a fresh twist (I swear, I LOVE basil and I'm still working on a lemon basil sorbet) and the olives added the salt that the goat cheese was missing. It was great and also paired really well with the Riesling the waiter recommended. After our wonderful mango and goat cheese salad, we had a foie gras brulee with muscat grape, tarragon, and ruby grapefruit salad. My friend's favorite dish from the night. I, on the other hand, didn't find the dish to be that special. It was too salty (especially with the burnt crust) and the grapefruit couldn't balance out the heaviness of the foie gras. Also, the foie gras was placed on a small piece of bread, but the proportion of foie gras to bread was 2:1, which added even more salt to the dish. The fish we had was a skate fish (it's closely related to the stingray) with a spinach ravioli and bacon bits on top. The fish had a nice crust on the outside and was very flaky and had a very similar texture to scallops. The ravioli was a little too plain for my taste (it didn't need salt or anything, but the actual pasta was either overcooked or just too big compared to the filling inside). Our final dish (before dessert) was short ribs marinated in various vinaigrettes with lima beans and a hint of lime.The short ribs, another favorite of Nick's, was a little too salty for me. I didn't think the lime added a good flavor to the short ribs (the waiter said that the chef recommended we use it) and I think they marinated the short ribs in the vinaigrettes too long. There wasn't the natural flavor from the short ribs, only a salty taste (in my opinion). Nick really enjoyed it, though. For dessert, we had another sampling: jean-georges chocolate cake (a chocolate molten cake), vanilla ice cream with cookie crumbs, a strawberry rhubarb soup with vanilla chantilly, and a spongecake with coconut vanilla mousse with a side of passion fruit. Jean-georges chocolate cake tasted exactly like a molten lava cake. The cake was REALLY sweet (lava cakes usually are) and the vanilla ice cream with chocolate crumbs didn't help. Nick really liked the chocolate cake (he's a fan of all kinds of chocolate) and he also like the cookie crumbs with the vanilla ice cream (they were very similar to oreo cookies, so it was like cookies and cream ice cream!). The spongecake with coconut vanilla mousse and passion fruit was slightly less sweet, which I preferred (even though I'm not a huge fan of coconut).The passion fruit was just the right amount of tang that the mousse needed. I would've preferred a lighter spongecake (this cake was similar to spongecake but was actually cheese based). Overall, I think the tasting menu was heavier than the menu from Babbo (the original tasting menu, at least), but not better. The tasting menu was a great way to try out the restaurant's menu, but I'm not sure we got the best taste of the restaurant.If you want to check out pictures from Jean-Georges, go to my website: gracenotesnyc.com. Happy eating!, The Flagship. The namesake. The darling of his empire. Wow. Everything was prepared perfectly. My squab dish made me wish that these flying buggers were bigger, sauced and seasoned just right, deboned and plated beautifully. Everything was so delicious. As expected, supreme service, all the little details - like napkin replacement when you leave the table. Yes, i'm yelping about them replacing my napkin. The most fun part of dining here was the homemade marshmallows in 3 flavors. My one minor gripe was that the marshmallows were so sweet, it muted the flavor of dessert. Ordered the trio of chocolate - how can you possibly go wrong with 3 types of chocolate? I'm so coming back., If the experience is what you wish to gain from dining out, I highly recommend Jean-Georges. I've been to some great restaurants and this one is truly fantastic. Everything I've ever had here has been prepared perfectly. Even those things that weren't my favorite still tasted delicious and I could appreciate them. The service (as expected) is excellent and this restaurant is not one to overlook the little details. Is is a good value for your money? Of course not, but that isn't why you would come here. You come for the experience hands down. If you have the money and love trying great restaurants, I highly recomend Jean-Georges., A lot of things can be accomplished in 4 hours:A round of 18 on the links;Watching LOTR: Return on the King;Completing about half of your work day;Take the GMAT;and , completing the 7 course tasting menu at Jean-Georges....I was really looking forward to this experience. I was going to be in NY for a couple days with the gf, and wanted to take her there to eat. I called them up 6:30am PST exactly 1 month beforehand (their reservations opens up 1 month in advance), and got a 7:45 pm spot. Sweetness I say!!So far, my fave restaurant and dining experience has been Fleur de Lys (SF). I was blown away by the experience, and it was only a 1 star rating on the Michelin guide. Jean-Georges on the other hand, 3 BOMBDIGGITY stars!! I COULD NOT WAIT!! So the day came finally, and we were ther, sitting in the formal dining room, and I was expecting something good, something grand, something that will keep me thinking back to this place 50 years from now after I've blown my cash. So....how'd it go? Well, it was 4 hours of sitting....and waiting....and....well, i'll just explain.I heard the service was suppose to be top-notch. Everything in your command, all the attention to you. However, what me and my gf received was.....well, not so much. The host seemed very disinterested in serving us. First of all I could barely hear him when he was explaining the menu. This wasn't due to the constant NY honking outside....no, you actually find the dining room is sound proof, and very quiet. And so it goes that the host was really quiet too. However, from what I did pick up, there are 3 menus. The 1st is a 4 course prix-fixe including dessert for $98. Then the other 2 are 7 course tasting menus. The Jean-Georges menu that has never changed, and a seasonal menu, both for $148 or so. Since this is suppose to be an experience, we both decided to try the tasting menus, my gf with the Jean-Georges, and me with the seasonal.Now, back to the service. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but it's wasn't anything more. It was like....we just got the bare minimum. The host quickly explained the menu (whispered), and quickly left. That was it. No engaging conversations or small talk, didn't even stick around for questions. However, observing him with the other patrons, he stuck around, chatted, made them feel comfortable, part of the experience. So I wonder, why did we get gipped. Was it because we were younger than all the patrons by at least 15 years?? Who knows, but it never improved. When the food came out, he brought it over, quickly told us what it was, then scurried away to check on the other guests. As for us, we were just left along most of the time, never any attention towards our side. For that, I have to give them 2 stars out of 5.Food-wise, it was good....but again, nothing exceptional. I've had better many times, and out of the 7 courses, and dessert, the best was dessert (the chocolate), and maybe....the foie gras, and the asparagus and mushroom dish. The foie gras was definitely heaven. It was the definition of delicacy and perfection, and the asparagus and mushroom was another slam dunk. However, the rest (the other 5 dishes) were just....ehhh, nothing special. No soul is the only way I can describe them. They were good...but nothing to die for. Not what I was expecting. The dessert tho....OMFG. TO DIE FOR!!! I got the chocolate menu, and man o man, was it good. I could've just had 7 courses of this, and would've felt I got my money's worth. All I can say is....you gotta get it.Time-wise, be prepared to spend some time there if you get the tasting menu, I mean...FOUR HOURS!!! Now, consider 7 dishes and dessert, which mean 30 minutes for each dish. Now consider this, these are tasting dishes, which means each dish only take about 4 bites to finish, which can't take longer than 5 minutes. Unless you have jaw arthritis, taking longer than 6 minutes on each dish is just...stupid. Which means, 8 courses mutiplied by 6 minutes each only add up to......48 MINUTES!!! That's 192 minutes, or just over 3 hours of sitting around and not getting any attention. I'm sorry, but no matter how good the food was, sitting around for 3 hours doing nothing is not worth a bill of $500 including tip. This may just be with the tasting menu though, since other guests who arrived after we did and only got the prix-fixe was out long before we finished.So, finally, midnight, 4 hours and $500 later, were we satisfied? Eh, it was alright. We were definitely full, since we had 7 dishes and dessert, and my butt had already fell asleep, was tired of just sitting and waiting there the entire night, and just wanted to lay down somewhere.Was it all worth it? Sure, for the experience of being at Jean-Georges, the supposed best restaurant of New York, but maybe it would be more worth it if you were at least in your 40's, so they might actually give a damn about you., I finally got to go to JG. It was like graduating to the grown-ups table. The service was very attentive and disciplined. Every time a dish was served, a 30-second explanation also went along with it. The waiters also knew a ridiculous lot about the food and ingredients on the menu (e.g. the sauce, the wine in the sauce, why the wine in the sauce is special because it's slightly more acidic than other wines from its region, etc). The lunch menu is quite simple - 2 dishes for $28; each additional for $12; desserts are $8 each. Overall, it's a great way to sample JG's inventive dishes without breaking the bank. As such, I ordered the scallops, the red snapper, and summer souffle for dessert. The table shared grilled shrimp. The presentation of everything is neat and precise. The portions are small - none are larger than a deck of cards - but you do leave feeling full. This is partly thanks to the little complimentary knick knacks they bring out before the first course (e.g. shot of gazpacho, small piece of shrimp toast, etc), and after the final course, before dessert (e.g. mini-macaroons, flavored marshmallows, etc.). The conservative portions also forced me to eat a lot slower and actually taste the food (yes, I had to take giant gulps of water in between each bite)., The lunch menu at Jean-Georges is great. It's only $28 for a 2-course meal, with each additional course an extra $12. Atmosphere: Nice, well-list, clean atmosphere.Service: Excellent. They discussed each dish when they presented it, making me feel like I was a judge on Top Chef. hahaha. Food: My companion and I got 6 courses between us. To start, there was a complimentary amuse bouche of a radish, slightly flambed seedless cherry, and a celery drink with a turnip cake (tastes just like lou ba gou from chinatown). First course: I got the fois gras brulee, and my friend got the blue fin tuna ribbons. The foie gras brulee included slow-roasted strawberries, and it was absolutely divine. The blue fin tuna ribbons dish was surprisingly large. I heard they have small portions here, but they gave a whole fistful of tuna. Second course: I skipped second course, but my friend got the corn-filled ravioli with touches of corn and cherry tomatoes. This was my favorite dish. It had bursts of different flavors, served in a hot place, and melted in your mouth. Wow. Third course: My friend got the halibut with mushrooms, and I got the crusted red snapper. Both dishes were decent. I was impressed how they were as sizable as fish you might get in any other ordinary restaurant. Fourth course: We tried the brandied cherry souffle. It comes with a rich chocolate ice cream soup as well as peaches with goat cheese and pistachios. The servers actually poured the cherry juice into the souffle while at the table. Pretty good, though I'm personally not a fan of non-chocolate souffle.Extras: Like most restaurants, it came with some little macaroons and 4 pieces of chocolate. What really impressed me though was that they also gave us 3 marshmallows each (vanilla, strawberry, and mint). They were all freshly made. My fave was the strawberry one because you can actually taste the strawberry seeds. Yum. Overall, this is a great value for lunch. Not as good of a value as Bouley's lunch, but pretty good for a 3-star michilen-rated restaurant., 'I have never been fan of French food, it always has taste like sour lemons not properly roasted. However, many rich people in restaurant had smiles and delicate flavor palettes.Valerie would have liked.Love Always,Roger', i went here for dinner during restaurant week, and had one of the best meals i had in a long time. from the amuse-bouche down to dessert.. everything was delicious. the cold melon soup was my least favorite (maybe because i like hot soups?), but it was still outstanding. the salmon was perfection, as was the veal. top-notch service too.i'd come back here for lunch, and if i can afford it, a proper dinner as well., 'jean-georges was such a letdown. sniff sniff. i was expecting to be wowed. to be swept off my feet. to sing its praises however, that will not be the case in this instance. one of our dining companions was underwhelmed as well. she said the dinner was SOOOOOOO much better. she was also a tad disappointed in her lunch. see my photos. btwn the 6 dishes i got to try, i cant say any stood out. service was ok. we ordered the chocolate sampler to share btwn the three of us. they did bring us lots of desserts to sample though.', 'OH.MY.GOD.Food, if it is defuckinlectable, has the power to make one feel all kinds of feelings. When I came out of here, I wanted to run to Cha-An tea house in the village to use the Japanese bidet. Just sayin.....And thanks to Counselor Kitty for the suggestion. I can never repay you for bringing JG into my life.', The dinner I had at Jean Georges is up there with my top 10 all-time meals. From the amuse bouche to the dessert, everything was intriguing, creative and otherworldly. It's one of the only dinners I've enjoyed with my family where nobody really spoke (other than commenting on how good everything was); everyone seemed deep in thought or meditative bliss, savoring every molecule of food on every taste bud. And, not for nothing, but my duck's drumstick had some kind of silver orthothic device attached to it lest I get my hands dirty. And as David Cross has explained, your wine will get a sweet ride., Had lunch at Jean-Georges. One of the best meals I have ever had. The service, ambiance, food, the plating and everything else was excellent. Before our tasting portions were brought out, they brought out an amuse-bouche before hand with with a trio of items. Asparagus soup with raspberry sauce at the bottom, pekoyte crab on a mini piece of bread with papaya sauce, and grilled fava beans on a spoon.My brother and I had ordered a bunch of tasting plates of the Hamachi with pink grapefruit sorbet and chili, some lobster dish with mangoes, and beef tenderloin with wasabi and ginger, gulf prawns wrapped in smoky bacon sauced with a sweet, tangy and spicy Passionfruit- honey mustard sauce, pekoyte crab salad with asparagus and melon juice. (I don't remember exactly what everything was called). Dessert was also a tasting menu where you could choose under the categories of Chocolate, Citrus, Rhubarb and Exotic. We chose Chocolate which consisted of Jean-George's signature molten chocolate cake with vanilla-bean ice cream, and came with a little cup of icy choclate concoction. Exotic had the Flambee banana topped with crispy phyllo and praline ice cream and Passion fruit-mint sorbet. Topped with a coconut foam. After the check, they brought out mini-choclates, and raspberry, pistachio, and vanilla flavored macaroons, and their home-made marshmallows which tasted like coffee, pink grapefuit, and vanilla. Who know marshmallows could taste this good., still --- 7 years later, this is one of my favorite meals ever. despite the fact that it was so long ago, i can remember every dish and every sip of wine. it was truly delectable. take someone you really care about. i am waiting to go again with the right person (don't want to ruin the memory :) ), Truly a special occasion restaurant for those with deep pockets. I ordered off of the summer menu which is $50 more than the regular tasting menu. Food is exceptionally good with several of the dishes perfectly done. Only one of the dishes wasn't great. Decor is good - classy and minimalistic. Service was good although a bit cold and impersonal. The sommelier was outstanding with 3 killer recommendations. Wine prices are through the roof, consistent with other NYC restaurants of this caliber. Great meal that comes with some serious sticker shock when the bill arrives. In this price range I prefer Daniel and Le Bernardin., 'I am afraid. I turn the lights on a little bit more. I stare at the Ouija board, hesitant of what I about to do, but I must. Casting my fears aside, I set my fingers in the triangular planchette.... I try to concentrate, relax. I move about the planchette slightly, letting it glide softly in the MB board to raise the dead. Suddenly, it jolts... my heart paralyzes for a second; Did it just move? -it did. I move it, wishing for the soul of the Yelper that I intend to summon. He must be asleep -I think to myself. Otherwise It won work. Ie done my homework. You can summon the spirits of the living; their unconscious personnas but ONLY, if they are asleep. But there is a danger in this, if you abuse them too much, their silver chord linking the spirit to their bodies might brake.

We ordered a couple of Bellini and our respective lunch appetizers/courses. Without a warning, they brought a complimentary entree, which even under normal circumstances I would consider odd, since we weren particularly charming or trying to make some points. I also saw the exchange in looks between waiter and maitre...strange!

I've been wanting a taste of this restaurant forever!Last night was the night and it was perfect :-)I had extremely high expectations for Jean Georges because of all the amazing Yelp reviews! And i was not dissappointed! Everything from the service right down to the butter was awesome!The waiters/waitresses were very attentive but they were not overwhelming. I hate when they ask you every 2.458734 seconds if everythings alright. Our meal started off with an amuse bouche of mozarella and fig, crispy corn fritters (effing awesome), and cold yuzu soup.We all ended up getting the Autumn Tasting Course because it sounded better than the Jean George tasting menu.Caviar on toast sandwiching slow cooked egg yolks- My favorite out of the whole meal! Hamachi Sashimi with Basil Sauce and Cherry Tomatoes- Fresh fish, nice flavors.Fried Peeky Toe Crab with Apple Puree- Delish! So Crispy on the outside and the apple sauce went perfectly with it!Arctic Char- Simple yet so good... this fish came with a sesame oil sauce. Fish was moist and cooked perfectly!Lobster with Grilled Corn Gnocchi- This was the one dish that i finished off because it was SO awesome! I couldn't stop eating it. There was a lot of lobster meat and the corn gnocchi was sweet and delicate!Lamb with Fig Compote- I usually never order lamb but this was absolutely delicious. The Lamb had a crispy coating... i really didn't know what it was. And the fig compote along with the white eggplant... perfection! It was also cooked to a perfect medium rare.and OMG.... dessertI got the Chocolate theme desssert....The Chocolate cake... period. The others, i could pass up on.... but this cake, OMG. But thats not it. Macarons, Chocolates and Marshmallows! And complimentary take home Chocolates for the ladies....We had 5:45 reservations and left there at 9:15 so expect a nice, long, dinner...., I've only been for the prix fixe lunch special for, at the time, $20.01. I was one of the best meals I've ever had. The menu was cauliflower soup and salmon. Frankly, at the time, I wasn't a big fan of either. Moreover, my date hated fish...And so, with low expectations, we ordered the prix fixe menu. We were both floored. The dishes were exceptionally balanced and subtle. We never had such a refined meal made of such simple ingredients and basic ingredients. I've since been to many high end restaurants and the only place that came close was French Laundry., My mouth was watering after reading the many great reviews in both zagat and Michelin guide many months ago. Unfortunately, reality did not met expectation.The food was good but I was not blown away by the taste nor the originality. The service was good but nothing out of the norm for an upscale restaurant. The ambiance is more business than anything else.I'd have to say though, Jean Georges has the best marshmallow, ever! Jean Georges store these marshmallow strands in a big jar; which make them look like biscotti from the side. The waitress brought the jar over, pulled one of the colorful piece out and cut a few pieces, then pulled another one and cut a few pieces, and she did that until we got a few pieces of each color. The marshmallows are sweet but not too sweet, airy like cloud (I think that's how clouds would taste like if I could taste them), and with just right amount of stickiness. They were delicious. I never expected marshmallow could be so tasty (def. not like those we buy in the supermarket). Mmmm.....I love it! Jean Georges should look into selling those marshmallows by the jar, I would buy them :P, A Michelin rates Restaurant and it isn't that great - I have to say I was expecting more. The food was good but as good as plenty of other restaurants in the city, I suppose it was more for the 50+ category than it would be for myself, but even then I have enjoyed my meal more at neighboring restaurants. Indeed if I had a business lunch/dinner for the targeted age group I would endure another meal here but in the meantime I will steer away. (Too expensive and its not a breath-taking experience)., so the sommelier justin is a good friend of my client's sister....i'd talk about the food, but was more impressed with the selection of wines, aperitifs and dessert wines. as soon as we sat down, there was a decanter of sangiovese placed opposite of me. justin knew we liked our reds medium-full bodied. justin also knew to stop by between every course to check on our meal and consumption of the sangiovese. he was concerned that our hostess for the evening was tasting too much tannin in the wine.afterwards, he pulled a special hungarian reserve from his private collection and poured us a taste. it was to die for. there was obviously the syrupy honey-jammy taste, but what i found most interesting was the sour note. made me reminisce about a great jing-du pai gu (mandarin style black vinegar pork rib dish) i had a few months ago with my family back in san francisco. our amuse bouche of fig/mozzarella, corn fritters and a cucumber/mint gazpacho type soup with yuzu foam was fun, but somewhat boring. i ordered the santa barbara sea urchin with jalapeno atop toasted dark rye bread. that was truly delicious. the sea urchin was clean and accented by the sour nip of the bread and spice of the jalapeno slice. my main course was a duck breast with a roasted pistachio and honey skin sitting atop a light honey reduction sauce. there were 3 cute little sweet white turnips, and a duck confit with a humungous skewer through it. also, there was a nice frisee with chopped chanterelle mushrooms and a chanterelle reduction dressing.it was so rich and SO indulgent. the dessert menu were tastings with a main theme. however, there was additional desserts of assorted chocolates, macaroons, spongecake ribbon slices, and sugar crusted jelly candy. the service was nicely choreographed. i would definitely come back again on someone else's dime. hee...(one word of advice: make sure you spray lots of bug repellent on exposed skin because although i looked mighty fine with my short-black-silk-chiffon-spaghetti-strapped dress, my pesky little six-legged friends also feasted on some tasty rare meat), This has been my favorite restaurant for years. I keep waiting for another restaurant to kick J-G off its pedestal, but it hasn't happened yet. The food is delicious and the serve is impeccable. What more could you ask for?, 'Arguably one the best restaurants in the city. Beautifully prepared plates of food. Impeccable and attentive service. Delicately balanced flavors that will satisfy both sophisticated palates and novices. Unparalleled selection of fantastic wines. AND, the three course prix fix brunch they offer on weekends are under $30 per person (without the wine pairing) so... what the !@#$ are you waiting for??!?!', I think the best indicator for this restaurant is that it's in a Trump building. It, like the man for whom the building is named, is given to gross hyperbole - and that's pretty much the take away that I have from Jean George. A variety of sites have raved about this restaurant (though, no one that I personally know has liked it). The food here is extremely ordinary (and not even well executed). The service is definitely good, but not stellar, and the atmosphere feels more appropriate for a business lunch than for a night out.For the money - there are far better restaurants in the city. I absolutely would not come back., 'First thing first,I didn see the Donald.I didn see Chef Vongrichten either.So how do I make this latest review of the world famous Jean-Georges restaurant really stand out?I saw a HUGE unicorn trot across the dining room!!! And it was eating marshmellows!!!Well, not really. But I did see marshmellows.Located in the lobby level of the Trump tower on Columbus Circle, this restaurant is one of the few Michelin 3-stars in the US. Being one of the elite 3-stars, it is also the target of every nutjob, hack, and wannabe foodie with a credit card and food blog. Tough crowd...As a fellow nutjob food blogger, I think I owe my loyal fans at Yelp my two-cents about this iconic restaurant. Some observations first. Other than the food, you could learn a lot about life here at the Trump Tower:- The separation of social classes is perfectly illustrated as you walk past the heathens dining at the Nougatine room on your way to the main dining room. Our snooty hostess told us not to stare...- Everything probably tastes better if youe surrounded by gold. An age-old fact confirmed by dragons, king midas, and leprechauns. Gold seems to be the dominant decor theme ound these parts.- ESP is for real... servers here at JG knew I wanted to take a leak even before I moved a muscle. They muste sensed the strain in my bladder.Wifey chose Chef Vongrichten signature menu (one that hasn changed in over 10 years since the restaurant opened). While I opted for the autumn menu with more seasonal ingredients.The food is excellent and nicely presented, but there were some side dishes and accompaniments that were misses for us.I think the timing of our decision to dine at Jean-Georges plays a key factor in our less than perfect score. In any other time, Jean-Georges would have been an easy five-star for us. But after dining at more innovative places like Charlie Trotter and Alinea in Chicago, wifey and I just couldn justify the extra accolade.Did that sound snobby and conceited?It would to a heathen...', I know this is a cheap review. But I swear I'll be back later., 'Johnny is my most favorite Pastry Chef ever! His food is amazing and uniquely creative!', Do I really need to reaffirm the popularity of Jean-Georges by writing another raving review? Probably not. For me...The chef's dinner tasting menu with plenty of wine = 5 starsThe lunch tasting menu with a glass of wine = 4 starsAverage = 4.5 starsI do believe that the food here is phenomenal. You expect every dish to be perfectly prepared and presented, and so far, I have not been let down. At least, there hasn't been any bad surprises.The service is impeccable. They must assign each staff one single task - like pouring water, delivering butter, exchanging utensils, folding napkins, etc...because you keep on seeing new faces at your table.But when will I go back again? Probably not for a very long time. There are too many other restaurants in this city (just around Columbus Circle alone) to keep up with!, 'JEAN GEORGES? Not one of the best in the world on THIS night... Posted on 12-31-2007 John George Vongerichten flagship restaurant was on my list of resolutions for 2007. Having dined exquisitely at JoJo and Perry Street this year, my expectations were extremely high for my holiday treat to JEAN GEORGES. We arrived on time for our 10:30 seating..but found ourselves trapped in limbo between the main dining room entrance and the bar at Nougatine. I had to dodge the servers that rushed by in order to avoid a collision. Once seated, I found the room not all that impressive. It looked like a glorified conference room. The colors are too muted and didn provide any noteworthy atmosphere. As far as service goes, no complaints, what one expects from a 3-Star Michelin rating. All the glasses were refilled promptly, the silverware replaced after each course, and the staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. Our sommelier was especially impressive and engaging. We ordered the 4-course prix fixe menus. Sadly, there were a few misses. Our amuse bouche was unextraordianry. The garlic soup was runny and bland. The squab tasted good but was a bit rubbery and hard to cut. There were some strong, positive highlights.The signature scallops with caramelized cauliflower and raisin caper emulsion were as advertised..scrumptuous. A luscious foie gras brulee with dried cherries lived up to JEAN GEORGESreputation. The roasted sweetbreads with grilled pear and lemon puree was a great dish but the pear somewhat overwhelmed the overall taste due to inadequate seasoning of the sweetbreads. The wine list is very expansive and many bottles are reasonably priced. We chose a very nice Portuguese Blanc which complemented our dishes well and lasted all the way to dessert. Pastry chef extraordinaire Johnny Iuzzini (formerly of Daniel) showcases his talents on a choice of well presented, expertly crafted, four course themed dessert menus (winter, apple, chocolate, citrus). On departure, I perused the accolades in the lobby and shook my head, No, missed the mark tonight. Pros: precision service, excellent wine list, intriguing dessert menus.Cons: an occasional weak dish, no clear waiting area, uninspired decor.', I must say this is one of the best meals I've had in a LONG time. The food, service, and staff was impeccable. Upon arrival, the hostesses took our coats and directed us to the double doors of the dining room. She told us to wait a second for the draft to pass through. How great was that. The server was very pleasant. Now onto the food...the soup I had was nice and full of great detail and ingredients. The filet mignon with herb fondue was mouth watering and the sauce had this wonderful flavor. I am still thinking about that filet. I'm usually not a huge salmon fan and the crackled salmon was just perfect. Desserts were good, but I've had better. I would definitely come back to Jean Georges! The best thing is that we saw Jean Georges there that day. What a treat!!, 'Jean-George is such a charmer. Have you seen his eyes?My boyfriend and I flew in to NYC for the weekend. We are huge fans of du Monde, Relais, and Michelin. So, it was no surprise that we made reservations at Le Bernadin and Jean-George, on this short trip to the island. I called Per-Se, but they were on a winter break.Nonetheless, the food was delightful at both of these places. The ingredients really shined with each bite on each plate.But, what made Jean-George even more special was the staff. They were the most hospitable group... And, without any instigation or regard, one of the hostess informed us that Jean-George wanted to met us. (Yes. Us! we thought, whom are we?) That was a pleasant surprise!'|3
23|jungsik-new-york|This newly open modern Korean restaurant serves only 5-course 'contemporary Korean cuisine'. I am a fan.Each of the 3-4 options in each course and the tasting menu all sounded great. Since the prices were the same ($125), our waiter told us we could choose from tasting menu as well.We started with a trio of complimentary amuses - foie gras with raspberry gelee, horseradish cream with salmon, and a nugget of korean fried chicken; followed by a delicate soup with a square of homemade tofu.Our first (salad) course included the Four Seasons, a small landscape of food including green beans, carrots, beets, grilled zucchini, egg; and Bibim, which includes mozzarella, tomato, arugula sorbet, crispies, which then you mix it all up. The Bibim was more successful.The second (rice/noodle) course was Sea Urchin with seaweed and quinoa (mixed) and the Champs-Elysees, which includes foie gras, kimchi, peppers, rice and egg yolk (mixed) -- both of these were amazing.We had the Crispy Red Snapper with mushroom puree and Mom's Scallops which includes a square of homemade tofu and a piece of halibut for our third (seafood) course. Delicious and cooked perfectly. At the same time, they offered us three types of bread: black olive ciabatta, sourdough, another one with raisin; all were good in their own way, and I believe baked in-house.Our fourth (meat) course was the Five Senses Pork and the Classic Galbi. The pork was good, though with all the flavors and textures, it seemed a bit confused in what it wanted to be. The Galbi (korean short rib), with pureed eggplant, roasted rice balls, and topped with cucumbers, was amazing.Then came a palate cleanser of grenache and apple ice.For our fifth (dessert) course, we chose pumpkin panna cotta and the tasting menu dessert which included pound cake, cream, crunchy bits, and some apple ice. The panna cotta included pumpkin puree with cream on top and was garnished with an acorn squash chip. Both were quite delicious.Overall, we had a good time, the food was good, interesting, new and the service was right on point. My only complaint was that the price is a bit steep and I left feeling not hungry, but not full.A good place to impress your date., granted they're playing to the home crowd in my case, but i found their blend of traditional Korean flavors and modern preparation/presentation to be pure genius. it's not forced or unnatural -- instead, they are bringing a whole new axis of flavors to modern dining. that limpid consomme with the bright aroma of chrysanthemum greens was stunning.the comparisons to David Chang will be inevitable, but this is at a different level entirely. more nuanced and subtle, this place gives you pause and at times makes Chang seem heavy handed. each has its place and purpose, though, and scratches a different itch.there were some minor service issues as may be expected within the first 2 weeks of opening, but all is forgiven!i haven't been to Seoul in over 10 years -- after this, i can only imagine what's going on over there...., SUBLIME! Can you equate Van Gogh's starry night to a dining experience? Definitely not, but at Jungsik, the emotion came pretty close. From the moment, I ate the trio of amuse bouches, I knew I was in foodie heaven.Service - impeccable but not pompous. Ambience - sophiscated. Romantic lighting and none of that funky music so adult conversation is possible. Seating - Luxurious, which is such a welcome treat from the 'ye got to suffer to eat' knee to knee dining trend. Above all - the FOOD! I shall frequent till I have tried everything on the menu. Actually, Chef - just adopt me!Long time member, first time yelper ......., 'It nice to finally see a different type of Korean restaurant come to NYC. I find the cuisine identical to noveau American although the dishes all feature Korean ingredients and since the chain started in Korea that qualifies it to be called Korean; so tired of all these bloggers cracking down on what authentic and what not. The concept of experimental/fusion cuisine is more novel in Korea than here so I doubt they will reach the same level of success; that being said they are on par with their peers and should be able to compete with similar mid-high end options.Menu is set- simple descriptions, pick one dish from each column totaling 5 dishes in Eleven Madison Park style. Started with the amuses: chicken nugget, horseradish cream, and foid gras gelee with raspberry reduction. Not a fan of horseradish or the chicken but the fois gras was perfection and made up for the other two. If you are a fan of the fois gras/riesling at Ko you will love this one too! They should turn it into an appetizer option. A delightful seasame tofu soup with shitake mushroom followed. Seafood salad with lobster and apple jelly was beautifully presented; a refreshing course. Unlike most restaurants where you choose a piece of bread here you are given one of each of the three rolls; all well done especially the raisin was excellent. Uni rice was great; particularly the rice part was impressive. The salmon was labeled OMG Salmon so obvy I had to try it although the waiter suggested the halibut. Particularly the accompanying vegetables were mouthwatering- they had that distinct locally sourced taste a la Blue Hill. I selected chicken for the meat dish; it was the only dish I wasn fond of- chicken was rather bland and the flavoring dull. The classic kalbi was a better bet; similar to kalbijim. Next time I will try the Five Senses Pork. Palate cleanser was slightly too capari-esque but otherwise revitalizing; served as a granita in a shot glass. Raspberry creameux dessert was scrumptious; served with white chocolate sorbet and spinach sponge cake. Dessert is followed up by petit fours- macaroons and mini spinach sponge cake bites; both had ideal textures. They are still working on their cocktails; was sent over a complimentary Purple Lady; gin mixed with bokbunja in a martini glass and topped off with egg white. A good drink but woulde been better with some simple syrup. Professional service and clean white space. They will be starting lunch and 3 course menus in the near future. I eat in Tribeca a lot and will probably come back.', I wasn't expecting a lot because I don't like Asian fusion food. I was blown away by the food and service. It was nothing like what I expected. Every course was a surprise. I tried the chef's special tasting menu and the salad was so amazing. There were three of us and we tried different menus. It was seriously the best meal...ever!!!, Junsik is a new addition to Tribeca restaurant fare, and after my first experience there for dinner, it is quite a welcome addition. This place was once occupied by Chanterelle, a French restaurant. Now this place has turned into one of the finest looking interiors for a Korean restaurant that I have ever seen with prices that match the upscale feel of the restaurant. Yes, this isn't your mom's Korean restaurant in K-Town boys and girls. This place is the creation of four Koreans who apparently met while attending the CIA in Hyde Park, with each possessing a different area of expertise. These four Koreans now make up the Chef, Sommelier, Pastry Chef, and the General Manager of Jungsik. What they have created, I believe, is a redefined version of Korean food, fused perfectly with elements of other fine tastes from around the world. Other Yelpers have already mentioned the Eleven Madison Park type of menu selection process, which I actually like very much. Since other Yelpers have already talked about the menu items, I will point out the items that caught my attention the most. Believe it or not, the bread was the best bread I ever had in a restaurant. It was so fresh, warm, soft and had me thinking when the last time I had bread in a Korean restaurant :) As far as the dishes that left a very favorable impression were the barley rice with miyeouk and octopus. This was absolutely to die for. I could've just orderd five of these! Everything else served was quite good including the desserts which we shared as a table. Also, while the rest of my table all had teas, I had the Americano which was quite good and even better was the presentation of the Americano's separate milk and sugar container which was unique in and of itself. Unfortunately, the only negative reaction we had during the dinner was the teas which tasted very metallic for some reason. We got to actually meet the Chef at the conclusion of the dinner and he was very gracious and nice. We will definitely make our way back to Jungsik., Jungsik means full-course meal in Korean, and that's exactly what you get at this new, upscale Korean fusion restaurant in Tribeca. You can choose each dish in a 5-course menu (there's also a tasting menu, but any of the courses can be substituted so you can basically customize your meal anyway you want). The presentation, food, and service are all outstanding, with the 5-senses pork being the standout (I loved the kket-nip puree). There are also complimentary amuse-bouches, petit fours, and tea! The free tea at the end really sealed the deal :)I would recommend checking out the website beforehand as they have high-quality pictures of every dish, that way you can know what to order beforehand. I think it's worth doing because it IS expensive, but as much as it was I felt the price was justified because it's one of the better meals I've had in a long time. My only suggestion for this restaurant would be to work on the interior design as currently it's a little boring and bland., At first glance, I honestly wondered how a Korean prix fixe dinner could warrant the high per person price tag Not to dismiss Korean food by any means, typically, you see a la carte servings and if at all a prix fixe, the prices are much more affordable. But certainly at JungSik, they've turned the table around, raising the bar to Korean (French-influenced) food. As a non-fan of fusion food that more often than not turn out to be a structural collapse in flavors, this place surpassed all expectations and was far superior than my initial impression. I was very pleased with every course....all traditional Korean dishes but so creatively reinvented that it blew my mind (ok, maybe a slight exaggeration =) ) Beyond the flavor notes that blended characters of the East and the West, the texture to all of the dishes served (meats and fish- and I am very particular to praise the latter, being a seafood person) was not a minute over or under cooked and melt in your mouth perfection.My only concern would be that I couldn't go there everyday as my favorite restaurant, given the price pt and the menu being a prix fixe. If they went a la carte, however, I could dote it as one of my usual spots. Even irrespective of the price.Note to caution - It's a bit on the stuffy side, but I'd highly recommend you try it out once. Perfect for a date. And even the play-on-words restaurant name is genius. =) (chef's name is JungSik = also means a formal full course meal in Korean). All in all, it's definitely worth the experience., 'I had dinner at Jungsik last week. It looks like the restaurant had made a number of tweaks, all for the better.1. The 5-course prix-fixe is now $115, down from $125. They have also added a 3-course prix-fixe option for $80. The 3-course prix-fixe consists of Salad, Rice / Noodle, Seafood or Meat.2. The service had gotten quite polished. The management is also encouraging diners to give feedback and it seems to be taking the comments very seriously.I ordered the tasting menu since it seemed people favorite dishes were mostly from the tasting and the server billed it as a menu of the chef signature dishes. I can say that every single item, every single bite I had was fantastic, but the special stand-outs were:Amuse Bouche #1 - Foie Gras Mousse with Black RaspberryWOW. This was even better than Jean GeorgesFoie Gras Brulee. The terrine was wonderfully creamy and smooth, yet the raspberry sweetness and acidity perfectly countered its rich earthiness. I get foie gras fatigued rather easily (once I couldn even finish the foie terrine at Per Se), but I totally could have had 3 more of these. I think this is my favorite cold foie preparation ever.Egg White Bread RollOh my god, this single bread roll was heaven. It was coated in an egg wash and tasted very Asian in that the roll was super airy and had a light hint of sweetness. You can get similarly sweet-flavored bread at Asian supermarkets anywhere, but this was the lightest, fluffiest, loveliest bread Ie ever had. I couldn quite understand him when the runner bearing the bread tray named the bread, but I think he said it was an Egg White Roll. I also tried the Olive Roll and it was delicious, but the Egg White Roll was the supreme queen of breads.Bibim - tomato, arugula sorbetThis is Jungsik version of the caprese salad. Ie read a couple of comments singing praises for this dish and I do admit I was still skeptical. It just a salad. How good can it be? I probably swooned (quietly) at my corner of the room when I took my first bite. The arugula sorbet lifted the salad to a godly level by lending a cool, bright, refreshing note to the medley of greens and mozzarella. Extraordinary. Favorite salad of 2011 thus far? Definitely.Crispy Snapper - shiitake mushroom sauce, oyster mushroom pureeI stared when the dish was brought in front of me. My, the snapper looked quite... prickly.... My server explained that in order to achieve super crispiness, the chef seared the snapper with scales on over extremely high heat until the scales crisped up and stood on their ends. I proceed to ask the dumb question of Do you eat the scales? He assured me that yes, you do eat the scales (that the whole point!).The fish crackled as I sliced a piece off. Upon taking the first bite, the roof of my mouth felt a brief tingly sensation from the prickle of the scales, then all of a sudden, the crispy scales shattered as my teeth bit through. I wasn quite dumbstruck, but definitely had a OMG, this is the most brilliant thing ever moment. It elevated the concept of crispy to a new height. I don think Il ever forget the experience of eating this dish. Just reliving the memory sends me reeling all over again.Like I said, the entire meal was wonderful. I know that a lot of people are skeptical about Jungsik menu pricing. However, now that Ie experienced the cuisine, I can honestly say that the $115 price tag for 5 courses is absolutely reasonable. In addition to the 5 courses listed on the menu, you also receive 4 amuses, 1 pre-dessert, 1 post-dessert, and petits fours. The chef is cooking at the highest level and can compete with the best in the city in my opinion. I certainly enjoyed my meal at Jungsik even more than the ones at the likes of Jean Georges and Le Bernardin.Jungsik is doing something truly special. Please don let the notion of the restaurant Korean influences and the chef Korean background pigeon-hole your thinking that Jungsik cuisine is over-priced Korean food. The refined, high quality food absolutely is not over-priced, nor would I call the cuisine Korean really. It about as Korean as Momofuku Ko is.I really hope Jungsik can flourish in NYC. Let go of your preconceived notions and give it a fair chance. Jungsik deserves more recognition. :)', I have been to the original Jungsik that first opened in Seoul, S. Korea. It was a stunning experience. It was stunning because Korean cuisine has always had the tendency to stubbornly stick to 'traditional' ways, and to respect the tradition, but Jungsik has boldly decided to express the Korean cuisine with a contemporary approach, allowing other foreign diners, who has never had experienced Korean food to better appreciate the elements of Korean culture. When I heard that Jungsil was opening in New York, I was concerned. Because if the Jungsik that opened in New York was not on par with the one in Seoul, fans will be very disappointed. I was half excited and half worried as I was making my way to the restaurant. But, I was glad to find out that it was needless to worry, because the experience was on par and I would even go as far as to say that it was better. The service, interior, and food was impeccable.The dinner menu is divided to 3 course menu, 5 course menu, and tasting menu that is fixed. I would highly suggest for the first timers to go with 5 course menu, because 3 course menu is very limited and does not allow you have the full experience that you need to fully appreciate this wonderful experience. I would recommend the 5 course menu, so that you can choose from the variety, which is divided into Salad, Rice/noodle, Seafood, Meat, and Dessert. Reading through each section is a journey itself and choosing your combination of courses is quite exciting, so in that sense I recommend the 5 course menu.Jungsik seems to take the presentation of food to be one of the most important elements of fine dining. Every dish is an art in its color, presentation, and form. All of their dishes are creative, and surely an innovative way to express the traditional Korean cuisine. And of course, presentation is not all there is to Jungsik. Taste is definitely a priority and they are proud to say that every one of their dishes are excellent. And it is true. Everyone has a different opinion and taste. But, if I were to recommend a combination of what is possibly the most representative of Jungsik, I would say go with Bibim or Four Seasons from Salad, Sea Urchin or Anchovy from Rice/noodle, Crispy Snapper or classic fish from Seafood, Five Senses Pork or Classic Kalbi from Meat, and I leave the dessert to you. I am not saying that this is the absolute way to go, but these were the dishes that made Jungsik become so successful and popular in Korea. My experience at Jungsik was an excellent. The staff is so friendly and services are prompt. I am very glad that Korean cuisine has finally entered the mainstream of fine dining and I am certain to say that Jungsik will enter the contender's list for next year's Michelin Starred restaurants., 'I ate here last night for my wife birthday and was very, very impressed with this high-end Seoul-based restaurant new incarnation in the old Chanterelle space.The presentations are delicate and exotic, as are the flavors of the cusiine. Korean food is of course known for its heavy use of red pepper paste, garlic, and pickling, but Chef Kim has done a fantastic job of evolving those flavors to high-end cuisine, rather than simply dumbing them down or making the food bland.We started with the Four Seasons, an artfully compoosed salad, and the Bibim, which, although you mix it like a bibimbap, otherwise bore no resemblance to the traditional understanding of that dish. Rather, it is a deconstructed Caprese salad, and it mostly works, with piquant flavor but a somewhat unsettling icy texture at times.We loved the rice course - both the Sea Urchin and the Kalguksu were impressive, the latter being surprisingly true to the spicy original.The fish course may have been our favorite - it hard to argue with butter poached lobster, this one with Korean mustard in the creamy sauce. The crisp red snapper from the tasting menu was also flawless.Of our two meat dishes, I would skip the Five Senses Pork Belly, by far the most heavy-handed and unworthy of the dishes we tried. The only sense I got from it was an overwhelming dose of pickled peppers. The Galbi, or their version of it, fared much better.The wine program is surprisingly robust and well-matched to the cuisine; the sommelier, apparently imported from the original, knows his stuff and has chosen the wine pairings expertly. Non-Korean folks may fear they are spending a lot of money on Korean food, but really, this bears no more similarity to the peasant food of Korea than spaghetti and meatballs do to the offerings at Babbo. Jungsik is a more adventurous choice in the high end dining scene, and it should be rewarded for it.', Exquisite nouveau Korean cuisine. Surprisingly different to modern Japanese (think Nobu) and Chinese. Never tasted anything like it. Highlight for me was the Birthday Meal, like the Korean equivalent of a risotto. We went for the three course menu and got an amuse bouche, consommd9 and petits fours in addition.One criticism was that they forgot to bring my second glass of wine until I prompted them. The maitre d' looked devastated and gave me a second glass on the house. Other than that service was flawless.Highly recommended. Would expect a Michelin star in next few years and will be on Zagat top 30. Get in while you can still get a table., Jungsik has a great idea; but falls short in the end, in terms of execution.It's been a few weeks since I ate here. The dining experience is fantastic. The wait staff is top notch and explains everything you're about to consume. Even the cocktails were terrific. I just have two bones of contention: #1 The cuisine they put out isn't 'modern Korean cuisine', it's more like new American cuisine with various Korean hints and touches. My party went with the 5 course tasting menu and it was delicious, they just need to reclassify their culinary goals. Even the Korean couple I dined with made a similar comment. #2 I know this is high end dining. I'm not expecting prices or quality that I get in K-Town. However, their 5 course tasting menu is a bit overpriced, especially since the food is barely Korean. With the 3 course tasting, they have way too many limitations as to what you can mix and match. I had a great time here, but between the high prices and confused menu, I'd only be back if someone was treating!, 'Just got back from one of the best dining experiences of my life at Jungsik. My fiance and I both did the five course menu. I had the Four Seasons for my salad, Spicy Kalguksu for my rice/noodle dish, Crispy Snapper, Classic Galbi, and ended with the Pumpkin Panna Cotta. The flavors and textures of every course were outstanding. Also, the service was great. Make your reservation now!!', 'Three cheers for Jungsik as it immediately joins the pantheon of NYC very finest dining establishments! Jungsik is a knock out, home run!My wife and I went for dinner on Saturday night and we were blown away. One of the best meals wee ever had. The service, the food, the presentation, the brilliant way the menu has been constructed, the ingenious and endless Amuse Bouches... it was a dining tour de force. We had the five course menu. Everything was delicious. The portion sizes were nice, more than just tastes. The pacing was excellent. Ie nearly fallen asleep trying to get through a multi-courser at Bouley or Daniel. But, at Jungsik, the pace moved along just right. Not hurried, but never lagging. (And, yes, Jungsik is in that league.)We had a waiter that deserves his own review, if not his own restaurant. He must have gone to English butler school or something. He was a hoot in a really good way. If you get him, youl know exactly what and who I mean. We loved him!Only a few things you should know in advance... - The tastes are very korean. Some times hot and spicy. Sometimes with tastes of sea weed, oysters, etc. Be ready for that.- The atmosphere is beautiful, but in a very understated, minimalist way. Think Perry Street, not Bouley. - The wine list by-the-glass is a bit lacking. We can wait to go back! Bravo Jungsik!', Michelin grade quality and stunning presentation. It's the kind of molecular gastronomy you'd expect from WD~50 but with wonderful & surprising Asian overtones. We tried 5-course tasting menus and the most impressive dishes were: Spicy Kalguksu, Tribeca Lobster, Mom's Scallop, Five Senses Pork Belly. Very pricy but that's expected for this quality., Wow Wow WowI have been wanting to go since I heard it opened and finally did last night. To my and my family's amazement from the begging to the end it was amazing. From the presentation to the execution of the food it just outrageous. We went with wine pairing and we were so glad we did cause to the contrary of my thought that wine does not go with Korean food it was amazing. Must go and experience., My visit at Jungsik was AMAZING!!!! I came here with my mom and dad for New Years and for fun. We each had a five course. The appetizers were the perfect bite size and all of the flavors were balanced. I also had the potato soup with prosciutto and brioche crumble. Their bread was light and tasty and the butter and salt was a perfect compliment to it. Out of all the soups, my favorite was the Kal Gooksoo and the Foie Grass with Kimchi. For the seafood, I had the lobster with butter. It was blissful and sweet. When you finish the lobster, there's these little bubbles that are chewy and sweet. It's a diced orange pimento. For the meat course my mom and I had a Five Sences Pork Belly. It was fatty and crunchy at the top with either the sweetness and coolness of white kimchi or the spicyness of kimchi. Before the dessert, we had a palate cleanser. It was acidic, sweet, and cleaned all of the after tastes from the previous courses (I suggest you mix the omija berry with the Asian pear purd9e to balance the flavor). For the dessert course I had a Raspberry Cremeux. The whole plate was light, tasty, and sweet. I loved the lychee pured9 (I personally love lychee and was surprised to taste a lot of the fruit in it. My mom and dad loved the wine paring. I had a uzu and it was very sweet and pleasant., 'After hearing my sister tell me how much she loved this place, I had to try it. Korean food but with a modern touch, Jungsik does it well. The ambiance is very much Tribeca. I forced my sisters to get the five course tasting menu. My sister kept saying: that going to be a lot of food! I didn agree, and after the third course I realized it was a LOT of food. Our tasting menu started with a delicious amuse bouche. One of my favorites was the Kalguksu, loved it. The pork belly was crispy from the oustide and tender in the inside. We order a bottle of wine, and who knew that after our dessert they offered you some macaron, a little bread pudding, and chocolate? I suggest you stick with the three course, there will be a lot to eat. Jungsik is the type of restaurant where you will spend about $100+ per person. That is, if you decide to order drinks, plan to spend $200 pp. If you stick with tap water then you will spend around $150. Yes, it is pricey. We took my sister for her birthday, so we didn mind spending that much. It is on the quiet side, and kind of a romantic place. Service was very friendly, and our waiter did an amazing job explaining every component on our dish. They give you bread, but skip it. The food is too good, you will not need it.', 'The tasting menu was FABULOUS. I just sung that.', 'I was a little apprehensive to try this place because I felt that I was gonna leave hungry but boy was I wrong. We tried the 3 course option (app, noodle/rice, and main) I really enjoy places that give a couple amuse bouches and that they did! We had 3 tiny bites and some amazing soup and bread. The earl gray bread was tasty. I started with the mushroom and poached egg app which was fantastic. Then I had the Uni rice with toasted quinoa and vegetables (execelente!) The boyfriend had the noodle special in green broth (delicious). For our mains, I got the pork belly and he had the braised short rib. We wouldve probably enjoyed our mains more if we werent so stuffed. Unfortunately, we didnt have room for dessert. Hopefully, Ill go back and skip my earl gray roll so I can eat dessert.', A good attempt at Korean fusion. One or two dishes were quite successful at it (the most memorable being the potato soup in the amuse douche), but the majority were just good attempts. They veered either too much towards Korean or towards Mediterranean, and the philosophy of a new kind of Korean food wasn't presented well at all.I'd prefer to take the amount I spent for the 5-course to eat 2 separate meals of traditional Korean, and Mediterranean cuisine., Very elegant and stylish decor and has a very exquisite air. We had the five course choice menu where we chose appetizer, rice/noodle, fish, meat, and desert. Each dish sounded more interesting than what it actually was. I know it's supposed to be modern but to me the food lacked the intense flavor of authentic Korean food, and did not have the consistency/flow as a course. It does not compare with the French restaurants of the same price range. The best part was the amuse bouche. The cocktails were very unique and refreshing. I would probably not go back., A truly unique experience! I can't offer a detailed critique of each course we received tonight, but each was a wonderful experience of different tastes and texture combinations. If you go, and you can afford this, do the 5 course tasting with the wine pairings. Each wine complimented the course beautifully. We had a birthday dinner tonight for six people. The wait staff was spot on in attending to our needs. Never obtrusive, but always observant and offering detailed explanations of each course and wine pairing. Overall, an excellent evening. Expensive, true. But worth it. We will be back when we return to New York., This place is excellent (4.5 stars really). The food was top notch, creative, rich flavors, friendly service, FANTASTIC wine list (and very helpful sommelier). We loved the amuse bouche(s) specifically the smoked potato soup. The menu is beautiful and I think it changes a lot. The 5 senses pork belly was rich and crispy, but the garnish was a little weak. Overall great experience, BUT have to question some of the pricing here - the bill for 2 people with 5 course menu and reasonable bottle of wine will be $200+pp. Cons were the decor (boring) and ambient music (didn't really fit the concept or mood)., An amazing dining experience. The wait staff was attentive and helpful. Their cocktails were outstanding and I highly recommend their signature martini. The Foie Gras mousse and kimchi were out of this world! The Five Senses Pork was quite possibly the best bossam variation I'd ever had. A friend of mine asked me if I'd ever take my parents (who are also Korean) to this place...my answer is yes. And they would love it., 'Cutie Patroller is always on the prowl in downtown NYC for cute places and great foodFancy Pants Night with my girl Kim!! This is a 3 courses tasting that was $80 each plus wine pairing $50/$75Overall - 3.5 heartsFood - 3.5 heartsAtmosphere - 3.5 heartsPrice - $$$$Full patrolling report coming soon........', 'quite the experience!Loved everything, but thankful it was a business dinner... It certainly was not cheap.The concept was intriguing, but I can say I noticed a ton of Korean influence - they said there was kimchi in almost everything haha, but honestly it didn differentiate from your standard New American upscale establishment.', Food is a passion of mine, but taking amatuer pictures of life and food is also another passion. This is paradise for taking picture of food art. Beautiful!Venue (4/5): This place is asthetically beautiful, the ideal 5 star restaurant with white table clothes, waiters in black and white catering at your every need, beautiful silverware. Only PROBLEM, we were the only people there on a Monday night at 8pm. Perfect for a date place that provides 5 star quality but not trendy by any means.Food (3/4): The food was beautiful and tasted good. The textures and tastes were carefully though out. Bibim - (3/4) Good. Unfortunately you pay for the beauty, because it tastes nothing different then korea town. Is the price worth the food, depends if you are like me that likes to take pictures.Sea Urchin (3/4): Great textures, but not the freshest Uni I've had. This was ok.Pork Belly: (4/5): Clearly the winner, delicious crisp on the top great fat on the bottom. YUM!Overall I enjoyed my EXPERIENCE, but it is not worth the value. I got my pictures, my experience... and I am happy BUT not a repeat., I am so happy that someone finally turned korean upscale. Yes, it's more new american than authentic Korean, but whatevs, it's sooo yummy.If I were to go back (hopefully soon) I would get:1. mushroom soup2. kalgooksoo --i totally grilled the waiter about this and was a skeptic until I actually tasted it. the noodles were sooo yummy and the broth was very unique.3. pork belly!!!!!! we also tried the four seasons, and other stuff, but I wasn't as into those as i was into the perfect trio above. Also, LOVED the malkoli/soju/bokbunja combo. yumyum., Very fine French-Korean dining, with very good flavors and oh so many amuse-bouches. We had dessert 4 times over, and plenty of appetizers. Among the 4 of us, for Appetizer we had the Bibim (very light and refreshing), the Apple (very rich); for Rice/Noodle the Champs-Elysees (rich but not well textured), the Sea Urchin (better but still not that good); Seafood we had lobster, cod and snapper (lobster was sensationally tender and flavorful, with korean mustard seeds, cod was very tender and sweet)' Meat we had the pork belly and duck (pork belly needs no embellishment, duck some of the best I've ever had); dessert the strawberry, green tea ice-cream, and apple baba. All very, very good. Value for money? Really hard to say. The drinks were also very well received. My wine sommelier was also exceptional, as was my pinot noir. Warning for those who hate surprises- when they offer you tea, it's not part of the set and can cost you $18 for the nicer green tea. We came on a Friday at 8:30 and were one of only two tables left by 11. I think this place deserves to be packed!, 5 courses and perhaps 3 hours later, our party of four strolled out past midnight, completely satisfied. Five courses - you get an appetizer, something deemed a noodle, seafood, meat, and dessert. The seafood dish is significantly smaller than the meat dish for those that choose the three course - since its either seafood or meat. There are four dishes to choose from from each course and a special menu on the back which you are allowed to pick from as well.The food here has a bit of french influence so very pretty, sauce heavy, nothing like your typical korean restaurant.The duck (minimum of two orders) was probably one of the best dishes. The lobster was buttery and oh so good. The cod was delicious, but it seems like every Japanese place can do cod pretty well so not that special but ordered it just because I like cod. I would say that the fish was extremely tender though. Apple - very interesting foie gras dish. The noodle course was probably a waste although the dishes were very light and refreshing - we could have probably done without it. It was a shame that the place didn't have more guests on a friday evening. This is truly a unique place.---------------Yippee! I was here before it got a Michelin 2013 star!, I brought my family here to celebrate mother's day. (The restaurant is closed on Sundays so we actually came for dinner on mother's day eve.) It was my first time visiting this year (prior visit was in December) and I found that they had adopted a new chef's tasting menu. Now there actually is an 8+ course tasting menu, hah! Technically 10, it's more like 16 courses if you count all the extras (amuse bouche, palate cleansers, multiple desserts...). The choice menu is still available, which allows you to choose one from each of the five courses (appetizer, rice/noodles, seafood, meat, dessert). Like mother, like daughter though. Mom didn't want to fuss with looking at the menu so we went with the tasting menu... and it was, seriously, a lot of food. And it lasted, seriously, 4 hours. I think it wore my mother out, poor lady ;p (We probably could have had just as great of an experience sticking with the choice menu.)Kierin (I think that's how you spell his name) was a delightful server... although he didn't speak any Korean so another server came by to describe the various dishes in Korean to my rents. It was tres cute and very much appreciated., 'We went here for our wedding anniversary, and it was a truly unforgettable experience. Right from the little starters to the bread to the stunning three courses, the food was sophisticated and flavorful. The place had a relaxed ambiance, and the staff and waitstaff were extremely friendly and informative, especially describing each course and suitable wine pairings. They also poured us some nice complementary champagne when we mentioned that it was our anniversary. The place was recommended to us by friends, and we certainly recommend it to everyone else, wonderful special occasion place.', 'I loved the food here. It was the perfect blend of Korean food and high class dinning. We came for anniversary and they treated us like rock stars. Champagne glasses, personalized menus and a special dessert plate. What a wonderful experience.', 'The foie gra risotto is the best thing i have ever tasted in my life, what a thrilling experience tasting the 5 course tasting menu!!! It was a culinary adventure, what a mix of flavors, and on top of that the service was perfect, this is my new favorite restaurant.', The food is outstanding here. One of the dining highlights for us this year. We had the 5 course with wine pairing.mThe highlights were the amuses, champs d9lysd9es, lobster and duck. Its not cheap but I'd say for price to quality ratio it is a bargain. We are looking for an excuse to come back. The wine pairing was inventive and service courteous. Overall excellent experience., AMAZING service and food! the server was so accommodating to our group, which included a vegetarian and my preggers friend, and the food was seriously probably the best contemporary korean food i've ever had. i never knew korean food could be prepared in such a unique way. i usually stay away from fusion type of restaurants, but this restaurant is at its own level. i will definitely be coming back here whenever i want to treat myself in the future. so delicious!, 'Excellent food, excellent service and sooo worth the tasting menu option! We celebrated our joint birthdays, Hubbie and me, and what a wonderfully mouth watering experience, and please go very hungry as there are so many beautiful little inbetween dishes, our six course was more like 16 courses! We loved it so much we are heading back for our anniversary celebration.', 'AMAZINGGGGGGGGG FOOOOOD! the best fine cuisine I had in NYC. I walked in with my friend and there was only two tables there so we wanted to walk back out but decided to stay because of the reviews. If you are a foodie, this is your heaven! the most interesting mix of korean and french flavors. they need to market this restaurant more and get some traffic because I have never tasted food so delicious!!!!', OMG... WOW.... This is serious business. Food is amazing, menu overwhelms (how do I decide!!!)' and service is IMPECCABLE (but approachable.) We were a little skeptical but quickly convinced by the service team's earnest (and successful) efforts. Every question was answered and every request provided and we were never left wanting. Somehow, no matter what we wanted they managed to exceed our desires. The food is both creative and remarkable; Korean traditions paired with Western execution. The presentation is BEAUTIFUL, our dishes looked like miniature pieces of art. Highlights included:- A pork belly bossam (confit over-night and crisped to perfection) - a MUST!- TriBeCa lobster with Beurre Blanc- Skate with chorizo and clam consommd9 - Crispy Seoul duck with apple-rosemary sauce- Wagyu short ribs with crispy rice cakes- Lychee-rose mousse with plums and rose petals with Sabld9 crumble (Paris meets Middle East meets Seoul - a love triangle made in heaven!)- Strawberry cremeux with spinach sponge cake and bay leaf sherbet (soooo daring and decadent!)- Ginger macaroon (part of their petits-fours plate)They also offer a very sophisticated wine list and excellent pairings. Do try the amazing Pinot Noir from Willamette Valley as it goes down marvelously with the duck as well as the pork belly.I'd suggest you trust the service staff with recommendations and wine pairings, and you are all set for a wonderful night. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a wonderful dinner at Jungsik. I can't wait to do it again.PS: They are right near Terroir TriBeCa - a great place for a night cap., 'Truly some of the most exciting, artful, and downright delicious food you can find in NYC right now. Not to miss dishes include the octopus, pork belly, sea urchin, short ribs, and the tabasco chicken. The piece of fried chicken included in their sizable amuse is worth the price tag in and of itself.', 'Although Korean cuisine is not one of the most exciting aspects for foreign tourists in NY, I really recommend this place. Food was great and the service was fantastic!', Thinking about my dinner at JUNGSIK brings a big smile to my face. Like a great first date, I can't stop going over every detail of the night. The harmony of great ambiance, service, and food left me blissfully satisfied and yearning for more. I entered the restaurant with a bit of skepticism because I've never had great 'Westernized' Asian fare before. Also as a Korean, I feel like I have the right to be a Korean food snob. So, I came in prepared to bite at the slightest sign of faltering, but left humbled and amazed. The most impressive aspect was certainly the innovative mind of chef Yim Jungsik. (By the way, the name of the restaurant is a pun on his name sake. Jungsik is his name but it also means 'fine dining' in Korean.) Every dish is carefully thought out and prepared. The authentic Korean flavor is still there yet enhanced by French culinary influences. Who would've known Kimchi and Truffle tasted so well together? We didn't do the tasting menu but ordered a good variety from the choice menu. I think we ended up eating almost everything they offer. I don't want to go into detail of each dish we've tried but will give you a list of what we ate and highlight the most memorable dishes. The CAPITALIZED ones are 10/10 and other dishes are all in the 7-9/10 range. It is definitely something you need to experience to appreciate. Amuse (Small bites packed with huge flavors)NENGMYUN, spicy chicken, cucumber cilantro gazpacho, mini bulgogi slider with DOUGHY FRIES and carrot ketchup, HOUSE MADE TOFUBread + BUTTEREARL GRAY RAISIN ROLL, rice sourdough, black olive ciabatta AppitizerOCTOPUS WITH SSAMJANG AIOLI Entreemiyuk risotto, bossam rice, herb soojebi with crispy snapper, champs-elysees, BRANZINO WITH MUSSEL BROTH, seoul duck, TRUFFLE RISOTTO, classic black cod, jjam pongDessert (Wowed by the entrees and blown away by the desserts!)STARWBERRY CREMEUX WITH SPINACH SPONGE CAKE AND BAYLEAF SORBET, plum lychee rose mousse with sable crumble, chestnut cream milk sorbet, green apple shaved ice with rice wine babaExtras (Something to walk you out the door)yuja macaron, dark chocolate truffle with barley puff inside (fancy crunch chocolate), SSOOK FINANCIERI know, it was a big meal and certainly a great one. I told you we ate most of the menu! Our server Kieran and general manager Jin were so attentive and helpful in facilitating this wonderful experience. Their service was excellent and no snobbery to be found. This is what I suggest you do now. Just open up your calendar, see when the next special occasion is, and call Jungsik to make a reservation. I am most certainly doing the same. Happy eating~!, 'Neither here nor there...the quintessential problem with fusion cuisine.Disappointing; the worst is when the sea urchin stinks. Color me an uni snob!Highlight was the palate cleanser...bad sign? You better believe it.', 'Tasting menu was excellent and there was only one traditional Korean dishAmuse bouche had like 6 things and the mini Korean burger and fries were cute.Earl grey bread delicious and why can one get good bread only at fine dining restaurants?The best was the new dish seared scallop with panko, shellfish curry sauceWagyu Kalbi short ribs steak style with Kim chi juice and sesame oil - excellent texture', Wow. Wow, Wow, Wow.This place is far more stronger in its Salad and Rice/Noodle courses than the main dishes (seafood/meat). I thought the service was excellent (though I could sense they were trying really hard). No complaints about the interior either. On to the highlights of the night...Rose of Sharon (Cocktail) - Definitely something different and finally a cocktail that isn't a simple soju-fruit mixer. They used to make this with egg whites, not sure if they still do because their drink menu seems to have changed. Bibim - This dish is an adventure in texture. It's cool, refreshing, and makes you wonder if you're enjoying salad or shaved ice (in a good way). I absolutely recommend this dish. 5/5Spicy Kalguksu - I enjoyed their reinterpretation on a classic Korean dish. Nice kick to the dish. I was tempted to slurp... 5/5Sea Urchin - The best Uni is always fresh, and it passes the test here. The crispy quinoa pairs well with the uni. If you enjoy sea urchin, this is a must dish. 5/5Summary:The main dishes (both fish and meats) were weaker than the appetizer and rice/noodle dishes. But it was probably because our table enjoyed the beginning courses so much that our expectations were raised to unrealistic levels. It's not that the main dishes were executed poorly, it's just that there wasn't anything special compared to what we were served. We enjoyed the amuse bouche (they serve a TON). Jungsik is worth the visit simply because it's cuisine and style is so different (in a good way). It's been 9 months since my last visit (this review is long overdue) and I find myself craving for their food. It's left a lasting impression and that's hard to do for someone who's dined at most of the Michelin starred restaurants in NYC., 'fabulous dessert!! nice setting, better tastes and warm atmosphere!!! but price is not right. good to try and to enjoy if your wallet is fat.', 'This is my only five star rating for Jungsik. A very high end Korean fusion place in TriBeCa. The tasting menu couldn have been better with outrageously creative dishes made in classic French culinary style using Korean and other Asian influences. Superb ingredients fantastically assembled with a true artists hand. This included a dessert tasting as well. Aside from the cuisine, this restaurant has an excellent in house bread facility offering exceptionally creative items executed as well as Ie ever seen. And the pastry chef is a master as well all with the same dazzling artistic flair as the main menu. VERY pricey and very classy, subdued modern decor, highly polished up to the highest NYC standards but nit stuffy - young and vibrant.', 'Excellent food. Great service (if a little too talkative). Nice cocktails and pinot.Great - Initial appetizersB, ibim, ongshimi. Rose of Sharon drink.Good : Shortrib entree, Pinot from Willamette by the glassOk : Octopus, pork belly, deserts', The food was amazing. A great combination of east meets west. We go the tasting menu which left us full and satisfied. My only complaint is that this place closes quite early so you can't really enjoy the place with an after dinner drink since they wrap up early., A full review of my experience can be found on my blog listed on my profile, but I wanted to give this place 5 stars on yelp too. The 10 course tasting menu is out of this world good and elevates traditional korean flavors to another level. The service was exceptionally friendly and the ambiance was quite classy. For standouts, I would absolutely recommend the Jungsik steak (cooked to tender perfection, with a very creative kimchi sauce), braised octopus (the most buttery texture that meat could have), and the wagyu tartar. If you also love perfectly satiating pork meat with a crispy outside layer hiding the tender juices inside, order the smoked pork jowel. It'll blow your mind., FANTASTIC! We had the tasting menu. The dishes were beautiful, delicious, and interesting. My only criticism would be the atmosphere - dim the lights, light some candles, whatever. But honestly, when the food is that good, it really doesn't matter that much (thus the five stars). Also, service was so wonderful and friendly while maintains the professionalism you would expect at a fine dining establishment. Treat yourself with dinner here., came here for a company related dinner eventWe ordered from the pre-fixed menu. I had the grilled octopus for appetizer, and the sea urchin, and the lobster for entree.Everything was DELICIOUS and prepared just right! and you can tell they use superb quality ingredients. when the octopus came out, I was thinking, the portion is tiny! but after all the food, I was stuffed! The octopus was grilled so tender and soft and seasoned nicely. The sea urchin was served with seaweed, sesame seeds on a floor of sticky rice! delicious! The lobster was fresh and tender and cooked to perfection in this creamy sauce Everything was great! including the ambiance and the service! I don't mind coming back here to splurge a bit!, Outstanding! The food will absolutely not disappoint - tasting menu plus wine pairing was $260 pp so it's a splurge.... But I can now say I've had the best meal of my life... Waygu tartar, truffle risotto.... Amazing!!!!And - visit the bathroom - Japanese style toilets are delightful - haha, 'Really enjoyable experience. The food was great - very different and unique compared both to normal Korean food and to other high-end restaurants. Seemed evenly split between modern takes on traditional Korean dishes on one hand, as well as more continental dishes with a Korean twist or using Korean ingredients. All the dishes were very inventive - pretty much all of them were done in a way I had never tasted before. Service was top notch. Attentive, with close attention to detail. In passing we mentioned it was my mom birthday and they brought out a special dish for the occasion. The space is very sleek and modern as well - it where Chanterelle used to be. The only two minor drawbacks come to mind: First, it was a very long meal. Granted, we got the 10-course tasting, but our meal ran over three hours. Not sure if the kitchen was backed up or what. Second, it a bit on the pricey side ($155 per person for the tasting menu). That said, well worth it and highly recommended, mostly because haute-Korean is rare, and it will be unique and interesting compared to most of the other high-end restaurants youe been to.', I thought this was going to be a 5-star place but the a la carte food just didn't live up to the expectations in terms of taste and each plate was tiny for the price that you're paying. I would have gone with the 10-course but someone in my group correctly pointed out that 155 for (fusion) korean food is ridiculous. The decor is beautiful and the wait staff was amazeballs. Food:Amuse of sesame chip with yuzu compote, tofu, fried chicken, slider - nothing really stood out. The slider was awful. The sesame chip with yuzu was decent and the fried chicken was OK but a little soggy for meEarl grey tea brioche - pretty good Octopus - just a few bites of vegetables and a few small pieces of octopus that were slightly fishy Sea urchin with seaweed and rice - sea urchin wasn't of the highest quality but it was good but the seaweed and rice underneath was a bit bland Bouillabaisse with regular shrimp, octopus, enoki mushrooms, fish, scallop, mussels - $45 for a couple of scoops of seafood? Overall, it was decent but this isn't something I would order again. Lobster with raspberry sauce - good lobster but nothing special; the sauce wasn't overly delicious or anything Wagyu (1/2 portion - 3 little pieces) - the marbled pieces were very chewy and actually good but the kimchee sauce did not complement them well Galbi (1/2 portion - 4 little pieces) - very chewy but decent Ginger with fruits palate cleanser - this is one of the best parts of the meal Strawberry cremeux with spinach sponge cake - this was very good, 'Without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants in New York! I live a few blocks away from Jungsik and kept walking by it and wanting to go in. I went for the first time last Spring and just fell in love with the interesting and new tastes and the really fresh, clean and quiet space. I went tonight with my whole family for my mother birthday (she was visiting from out of town) and it was just above and beyond spectacular. We let them know it was her birthday and they had specially printed Happy Birthday! on the top of the menus- maybe the sweetest thing Ie ever seen a restaurant do! Each course is so delicious and the perfect size for sampling lots of things and sharing with everyone at your table. I a little obsessed with their lobster (the most delicious thing ever) and loved the scallops, which I think is a new menu item (or at least new since the last time I visited). Everyone who works there from the manager to the sommelier to the waiters are so friendly and explain really well what youe eating and the different fusion aspects of traditional Korean dishes with other influences that make the food so unique and delicious. Ie been lucky enough to eat at some of the best restaurants all over the world and it pretty hard for me to leave a restaurant saying Ie never tasted that before but I do when I leave here! It the perfect place to go for a special occasion where you know your going to have a great experience and consistently amazing food! I love also that it feels very serene and quiet inside, which is hard to find in a downtown upscale restaurant. My mother is very sensitive to noisy restaurants and it is very hard to find a great downtown place that doesn have loud music or too close tables. Can wait for my next special occasion to go back and enjoy everything again!', When Jungsik first opened in New York, named for Mr. Jung Sik Yim, and a play on Korean for 'fine dining', it was both appreciated and lampooned. The decision to price its tasting menu at the level of EMP was derided as unreasonably bold, but the major reviewers noted that Mr. Yim's cooking was not as far off from that mark as one might expect of an upstart. Having had several months since then to further develop the dishes and incorporate the major critiques leveled against his endeavor, I was eager to see the extent to which he had adapted.Most notably, the three and five course menus were gone, much to the shock of the women dining to the left of Tiffany S. and I. They were instead replaced with an a la carte selection, which in my opinion seemed something of a fool's errand. The prices seemed a touch too steep, so attempting to pick a mere one or two exciting dishes would be akin to buying a third of a box of macarons at four-fifths of the price. As such, the two of us opted for the tasting menu. I mentioned my shellfish allergies, and was given a stunningly generous list of substitutes to choose from. As we confirmed our intentions with our waiter, the general manager, Jin Ahn, welcomed us, sincerely apologizing at the cancellation of our earlier reservation due to the storm, and graciously and unnecessarily offering us champagne on the house. In a sign of the flawless service to come, our amuse swiftly followed the pouring of the champagne. A sesame rice chip, a potato puree, a cold gel of chicken stock, and a smoked tofu tower, which in turn begat bulgogi sliders, with the final amuse being Mr. Yim's take on Korean fried chicken, were placed delicately before us. If it sounds overwhelming, it was. Not that the excitement of the kitchen should be chastised, as it served to showcase some of the textural nuances and truly creative flavor combinations we were in for. Sadly, the bulgogi sliders served more to lull us to sleep, and were underwhelming. Before our first true courses, the sommelier, Kyungmoon Kim, asked if we'd like to see a wine list, and at telling him that we'd be partaking in the wine pairing, grew visibly excited, hurrying (though not unbecomingly) to procure our first bottle. In the meantime, our first course arrived. Tiffany received a silky clam chowder, and I a rich, buttery chestnut soup, along with sumptuous earl grey infused bread, made in-house. As Mr. Kim returned, we were given detailed but interesting rationales behind our selections of wines; a pattern that continued appreciably throughout our meal. The wines that we had the pleasure of being served were all matched to our food immaculately, my substitutions included. Mr. Kim has compiled an incredible list, and has gone to great lengths to alternately balance and enrich Mr. Yim's cuisine. What followed our soups was a foie gras with an apple gelee that left the two of us bewildered. What a simple idea for needed acidity, and what wonderful execution. Execution which was rivaled in the fantastic wagyu tartare, with its interplay of somehow opulent egg yolk and firm, savory beef. My mushroom dish, submerged under a beautifully poached egg and Parmesan crisp sung of dashi, kimchi, and umami. The octopus in ssamjang aioli was tender perfection, and with the slightest hint of salinity. The bossam that followed was the opposite extreme, nearly disturbingly crunchy, but equally delicious, interspersed with lettuce and negi, though thankfully forgoing the clumsy wrap structure. Though my Classic Fish was a fine take on black cod, in a moat of smoked red pepper, I much preferred my partner's snapper, sitting in a bed of cilantro and jalapeno puree, though I couldn't enjoy the clam broth below. The scales had been left on, and fried in oil, leaving them delightfully crisp. The kimchi steak jus, sadly, had a bit too much heat for the wagyu, and was the first and only true miss of the night for my palate. In a meal of so many dishes, that is quite a showing. The desserts quickly redeemed the minor misstep, with the omija granite serving as a perfect palate cleanser before the stunningly rich pumpkin cheesecake. The artfulness of the plating of Jonghun Wong should be commended. Crystalline leaves evoke fall as successfully as the pumpkin cheesecake itself.In truth, though it be high praise, Jungsik provided one of the finest meals I've had the pleasure of enjoying. Along with that, the staff are truly exemplary to a (wo)man. It has truly earned its Michelin star, and I felt a creeping sadness at the half-empty dining room. In an era where a Michelin star does not have the cachet it once did, given some of its more questionable recipients(Rouge Tomate), nor does it ensure continued success(Picholine), word of mouth once more returns to the forefront of generating excitement in fine dining. I cannot urge you any more vociferously to go to Jungsik. There are extraordinarily few restaurants more deserving of your time and attention., At first, I was excited to go to the only Michelin rated Korean restaurant in the city, but I started getting a little nervous after reading some of the reviews from the NYTimes and NYMag. Do not listen to them! Yelpers would never steer me wrong. This place is fantastic - truly one of the best, most enjoyable and fun meals I've had. I would highly recommend this place to others, and more people should be going. Do not let this place slip out of our hands!We got the ten course tasting menu. Being Korean, every dish was new and familiar at the same time, which I absolutely loved. Memories of childhood collided with brand new tastes and sensations. The few standout dishes include the foie gras, which was so creamy it was like ice cream, the octopus, which was cooked to the perfect texture, the red snapper with its perfectly crisped scales, and the truffle risotto with the unexpected crunch of kimchee. In terms of dessert, my husband thought the omija granite was the main dessert because it was so good. But the pumpkin cheesecake followed and it was every bit as delicious as it was beautiful.Our service was impeccable. Waiters were friendly, attentive, and accommodating. The manager immediately made us feel at ease. It was certainly a very special experience. In terms of price, the restaurant would probably do better (ie, get more patrons) if the price point was $10-20 cheaper but we are most definitely not complaining. My friend said it was better than some of the Michelin 3 stars he's been to.It's a little bit of a trek, but it's worth it. I hope I get the opportunity to come here again!|2

I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of my experience at this restaurant. The service was impeccable. Both Charles and Dave were very professional and knowledgeable. Dave did a fantastic job on the wine pairing. We were pleasantly surprised with each pairing.Overall, our experience was really amazing.I highly recommend this cozy and very charming restaurant and I will go there again myself.Definitely worth every penny.Bon Appd9tite!I hope your experience will be as lovely as ours.', 'Don you feel sad because it getting close to the end of the meal? That when you know it a good meal.A-mazing.I found out about the opening via eater/grubstreet. Chef Keiko Takahashi and husband/sommelier/wine connoisseur Seigo Takei sold Michelin starred El Paseo last year and opened their current place yesterday! I am beyond happy that this was my last dinner in San Francisco.The restaurant is located in the ground floor of an apartment building, across the street from my former abode. I wish I could stay here forever and try everything they have to offer. The 8 course meal was mind-blowingly delicious for $88. The wine pairing was equally impressive. My favorites from the tasting menu were the lxtravagance de fermiersalad and the brioche au fromage. The sweet and salty taste, crunchy and melted textures waltzed on my tongue.I will definitely come back to SF for another meal at Keiko.', 'An outstanding experience. One of the better fine dining experiences of my life. My friend and I had a great all around experience. The 8 courses were all an event within themselves and Dave (Sommelier) made the experience perfect by bringing out a unique 1/2 glass-of-wine for each of us to pair with our courses. I live 1/2 block away and will be back for special occasions for sure. The bill was not for the faint of heart, $300 all-in for the two of us.', We had the chance to check out the newly opened (one week old) Keiko d6 Nob Hill and it was superb. Considering the short time they have been opened you can tell the staff, Chef and Sommelier are all seasoned professionals with great pedigree. Every thing was as close to perfection as one could expect for this newly opened creation from Michelin-starred Keiko Takahashi. The Contemporary French Japanese inspired food was fresh and expertly prepared. This is not traditional style French food, this has a very healthy California Fresh approach with very light sauces that are drizzled or dolloped artistically around the Farmers Market fresh ingredients'. A few favorites of ours on the Chefs tasting menu were the lightly Pan Seared Foie Gras w/ Espresso Sauce, Pan Seared Scallop and the melt in your mouth Rib eye steak. Wait it gets better, the flavors of each dish, were exquisitely paired by Seigo Takei with his amazing wines and were perfectly matched to our palettes. If this gem is so perfect just getting started we can not wait to go back once they have some more time to practice. In a word, fantastic!, 'The food is outstanding. If you are not up for a full tasting menu you can order a la carte at the bar. The wine list is OTHERWORLDLY and ridiculously reasonable in pricing. If you can splurge on wine your money will get you thrice the buying power. The precision you find in the food is exceeded only by the taste.Friendly staff - not stuffy and truly happy to see you there.So happy to have something so nice back in the neighborhood.', 'a new restaurant, on par with gary danko and benu. tasting menu with eight courses is 77/person, wine pairing is an additional 78/person. we opted for a bottle instead, at the recommendation of our sever. a 1983 french burgundy.the food was delicious, the service was outstanding, the wine was delicious. the highlight of the evening was definitely the last course, that connele thing made with the french beeswax....soooooooo delicious!', 'One of the best meals Ie had in a long long time. It $77 for 8 courses, and a relative bargain for this level of sophistication. Flavor-wise I found the food more French than Japanese. But the Japanese influence was more evident in the crispness and lightness of the dishes. The Extravagance de Fermier Salad was simple, fresh, and beautifully presented. The foie gras with espresso sauce was rich and delicious. And the scallop with uni was oceany and wonderful. Wine pairings were perfect.The staff was also very friendly and Keiko and her husband were very nice as well.', Went here for our bday dinner with some close friends. The restaurant is charmingly located in a old Nob Hill residential building. Not a place you would normally expect to find a restaurant in this exclusive enclave of SF. Decor is contemporary and French. In fact, this was the highlight of the restaurant. The restaurant gets 5 stars for decor alone. This is a perfect place for a quiet, intimate dinner also very accomodating for business meals.Keiko is the chef. She is a young Japanese woman. All of the dishes were well executed but nothing wowed me to the bring the rating to 5-stars. Great service as well. Best of all, I think the price is very reasonable. They've just opened so I would definitely recommend everyone to try this place. It was definitely one of the better dining experiences I've had in SF this year., I'm at a loss for words.Those of you who read my reviews will know that is ODD. The best meal I've ever had was at Bernardus Lodge in Carmel Valley - this meal was equal to or topped that dinner. To be more specific, my Bernardus experience was almost 4 years ago and was my HONEYMOON; so, pretty hard to beat. This meal was succulent, fresh, inventive, balanced, purely top-notch. Although the fare is an eclectic mix between Japanese and French fusion, one can find purely French (foie gras) and purely Japanese (big eye and yellow-tail sashimi) fare on the menu side by side. Desserts are just as interesting. The ginger panna cotta was surprising. Balanced to such an artful level that no one flavor was overriding the other. Plating was divine and offered hints of flavors that delighted the palate. Great service. Great wine selection. Great GREAT GRRRRREEAT!!!!!!!!, I cannot help but gush like a small sailormoon-like schoolgirl.Perfection. This place is absolutely perfect. The dishes have that je nais se quoi of French flavors and that assari quality of Japanese cuisine. This is a place I will come to every 2 weeks, it's THAT amazing. Foie..with ESPRESSO! It's not some boring candy-like crap. It's unique and working out the forlorn bitter tastebuds in our mouths!The service is impeccable and Seigo, the husband/sommelier is so knowledgeable and charming. You can feel that everyone really wants to attain the very best at whatever they are doing here. The crowd is...wierd. Maybe I went on an off night, but of the 3 tables, 2 were filled with the VERY GROTESQUE pairing of a young asian female and an white male twice her age. NASTY. The other table was filled with extremely dapper octogenarians. Pocket Squares so hip. Jackets are not required but suggested. Parking is a massive massive pain in the butt, but its really worth it to dine here., Food was good, but not sure if it was quite as good as they are aiming with the pretense and environment. On the other hand, it's only $77, so...expect enjoyable, competant, but not earth shattering flavors or creativity. What does stand apart is the wine. They really know their stuff. The owner (husband of the chef) is a sommelier, and it appears that half the people working the floor were also sommeliers. Sat at thebar and chatted with one most of the night, and he turned me on to the best Pinot I have ever had. The experience and knowledge gained alone was worth the check, which was pretty hefty. Would definitely recommend this place to oneophiles., I came here with my girlfriend for Christmas Eve. They had a special Christmas menu and I can't recall all the courses we had but all I can say is that every single course tasted heavenly. It is an intimate quite space and the tables are far enough from each other for you to be able to speak freely. Really nice ambience.The service is great and we got to meet Keiko (the chef) and her husband/sommelier . Super nice people. I'm certainly going to come back here. I'm also looking forward to check out the lounge menu. The restaurant just opened four weeks ago, definitely worth a visit.Street parking is a pain but there is a parking garage close by on washington between leavenworth and jones., 'My husband and I have been anxiously awaiting the opening of Chef Keiko & her husbands latest restaurant. We were huge fans of their previous establishment, El Paseo, and couldn wait to make reservations here. We decided to treat ourselves to an early Christmas dinner a week early. Be sure to get the Grand Wine Pairing (Chef Keiko husband, who is also the Sommelier will wisk you away on a journey on world wines & include a tasting from his own collection) & after the truffle presentation you won want to miss its addition to the Hokkaido Scallop-higokuOyster Soup: Oyster, scallop stock, leek and potato-(*)Extravagance de Fermier Salad Golden beets, red beets, artichoke, brussels sprouts, sugar peasgreen pea hummus, red bell pepper puree, caramelized almonds, curry mayonnaise-(*)Pan Seared Artisan Foie Gras with Espresso Sauce : Chef Keikos signature dish: accompanied with artichoke and Japanese sweet potato puree-(*)okkaidoScallop with Sea Urchin: Hokkaidos cold water makes scallop more complex flavor-Black Angus Rib Eye Roti: Lightly dry aged rib eye served with gratin daffinois-Brioche au Fromage with epoisses espuma-Gateau Chocolate with chestnut ice cream and passion fruit caramel sauce-Cannele Bordelais: A cake with a rich custardy interior enclosed by a thin caramelized shell (*) = Favorites. $77ppThey also offer a bar menu, but we highly suggest the course dinner. We loved Chef Keiko preparation of the pork belly a few years back (no other restaurant has been able to prep a pork belly dish that can even compare), so wel be back to try the kakuni on the next round.', I can't think of anything better than my two favorite cuisines fused together....Japanese and French. Keiko d6 Nob Hill was a dining experience that gave my palate and heart a joyous and wonderful feeling. I dined here for the first time on New Year's Eve and I can say with utmost confidence that every single course in the 7-course tasting was absolutely delicious. The special holiday menu consisted of...- Amuse-bouche- Truffle salad 'Le Terroir'- Pan seared foie gras with espresso sauce- Lobster yuzu-miso Gratin with shigoku oyster and Hokkaido scallop- Two styles of preparation of dry-aged Black Angus beef- Mimolette and cream cheese 'Gateau au fromage'- White chocolate bavarois with truffle ice cream - Canneld9 BordelaisEach ingredient in every dish was perfectly fused to compliment and bring out the best in every bite. Chef Keiko is truly master at creating a dining experience where her food tantalizes the palate. Not only is the food superb, but the service was also top notch. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys fresh food created from the heart of a chef who truly enjoys her work., 'I came here on new years eve eve and enjoyed their special 7/8 course holiday meal. The food and presentation were very good and met the expectations I have of a 1* Michelin chef. I especially enjoyed her signature dish, foie gras with espresso sauce.Seared foie gras, artichoke puree and espresso sauce. Each individually was good on their own, but together, blended into a wonderful tasting mouthful. It was clear that Keiko, the chef and co-owner, took great joy in developing her menu and the presentation of each dish was very elegant. The restaurant has only been open for about 5 weeks and their service still had some bumps to overcome. The sommelier was very knowledgeable about his craft but lacked skill in getting us excited about the different wine pairing options. For example:Wife: what types of wine are in the pairing?Sommelier: well its not set, it based on how we feel the meal is going and your preferencesWife: what the difference between the regular pairing and the grand pairingSommelier: well the grand is more expensive and you get older wines...All true, but we were probably looking for a little more detail to get us interested in the upsell. Overall, though, a pleasant experience.This was a cozy restaurant that I intend to revisit the dining room for special occasions.They also have a bar area to enjoy a less formal meal that I am looking forward to trying soon.', Top shelf birthday dinner with the wife! It's a beautifully designed, small, romantic dining room. No expense has been spared, from linen to flatware. As soon as you get in the room, you know that this place is a Michelin star waiting to happen.We (predictably) ordered too much food, then proceeded to eat ALL of it. We started with a quick bite of sashimi at the bar, gorgeous presentation of exquisite raw fish and healthy portion. Went to the dining room where Bradley, Dave and Seigo took us through the tasting menu along with the grand wine pairing. The service was perfect, the food was fantastic and Seigo is a tremendous host. The highlight was a lovely aromatic mushroom rice dish, ABSOLUTELY COVERED in freshly shaved black truffle. Tremendous. Mrs. C isn't a big steak eater, but the cut of beef was gorgeous and savory so I didn't get to finish hers like I assumed I would... Most important for wine lovers, Seigo's wine list is porn for francophiles, with an amazing array of VERY well priced selections, most notably from Bordeaux and Burgundy. I will definitely be back for Chef Keiko's cuisine, and another pass at that killer wine list! Also, if you're not ready for the full tasting menu only treatment in the dining room, Bradley has a selection of appetizers available in the bar/lounge. Perfect for a week day drop in!!Find a special occasion (or make one up) and get in there!, 'My my, what a treasure this place is.I have my best friend living in SFO and he is one savvy guy. He knows the only best, and he took us here for special dinner with his other friends.I didn even know what this place serves, as I haven been in Bay area/SFO for years. I just knew that it was Japanese. Well it is, but it isn. You know what I mean? This place is OLD SCHOOL french meets hard working, passionate Japanese couple. One female chef and male sommelier who marriage created a one in a lifetime miracle in dining. Keiko is only female chef to be given a Michelin star. And she pretty darn young too!That bad ass!Seigo san knowledge about wine is par to none. Wine is his life. You get the idea.My friend and Seigo san had been carefully crafting the wines we were going to pair that night. I also had a chance to taste a very rare spanish beer that had no label. It was very fruity with a hint of malt. Wonderful. The whole layout of the meal was just....I lost for words really.Perfection doesn exist, but this was pretty darn close. And you know I am one picky guy. We had 1970 Burgundy that tasted like if you get a liquid gold. It started light and playful, but in 10 minutes it turned smoky and deep. This thing is living creatures I swear! What a incredible wine.Foie Gra with espresso sauce was great. I am usually bad with Foie Gra because not many places cooks this well and the fat almost always overwhelms the palette. She nailed with this sauce. I cleaned the plate. 2 thumbs up!I love it that her cuisine carries such old school french but there are touches of Japanese in it. You just don get this anywhere in the world. As my friend says, This type of old school cuisine is almost extinct. Well I hope she continues to thrive. This is one of the most rare restaurant in the world in that sense. She offers some Japanese dish on the side on different days so I will swear I will fly back to try them. Pretty close to perfection!', 'This is up there on one of the best restaurant I have been to list. Seven courses of pure heaven. This is a new restaurant so as the word gets out, be prepared to make reservations far in advance. The owner is charming and sweet, every course was beautiful and delicious, the dining room is beautiful. The ambience, the wait staff and the food are incomparable. We have made our reservations to return again.', One of the joys of living in San Francisco is the myriad of wonderful restaurant options that we have. I definitely have some of my favorites, but Keiko a Nob Hill has risen quickly to the top.I went right before Christmas for appetizers and wine with a friend, thinking of a more casual meal to whet the appeal for a return visit in the dining room. Boy was I underestimating the experience. It was a sensory treat, from the elegant decor, to the delectible scents, to the hushed environment.After several modestly sized yet flavor-explosive appetizers, coupled with silky wines by the glass, I relish my next visit, this time to enjoy the full culinary experience of Keiko and Seigo's abundant talents., For a foodie, this is an interesting experience. On the plus side, Keiko-chan is creative, serious, intelligent in her dishes. She used some ingredients and pulled off some combinations that were unique and surprising. The quality of the ingredients is exceptional. It seems as if she personally does everything in the kitchen, each dish is carefully presented with flair. When we were there, we happened to be sitting next to her mother and some guests, and she came out to say hello -- very charming. The portions in each course are small, and sometimes you wish you could have another bite to confirm the flavor or try a different taste combination (you get only one tiny golden beet, for example), but cumulatively there's plenty of food.On the negative side, two desserts isn't necessary. Adding truffle (and they added lots of truffle) to the signature dish of Hokkaido scallops with uni was probably one strong flavor too many and overwhelmed the scallops. It's very much a family operation but kind of masquerading as a fancy French restaurant, Mr. Keiko acts as the sommelier and chief waiter and is a bit on the stuffy side, as is the dining room. The service was sporadic -- courses were not evenly paced, we waited 20 minutes for the first dessert course. I think it would be more charming if they took the pretension down a peg, but as it is pricy maybe they feel they need to make it seem fancy. It's not Masa, and shouldn't try to be. It's a great place to try and we might go there again in 6 months but it's not a place you find yourself saying, let's go back soon to try something else -- the menu is what it is.Parking is very difficult up there., This new restaurant in the Clay Jones building in Nob Hill has exceed my expectations. I was pleasantly surprised to find an elegant, yet light and beautifully prepared meal. I haven't tried the prix fix, but rather just the bar menu and that was fantastic. The risotto was absolutely incredible as well as the restaurants take on beef stew. Not to mention the exhaustive wine list. Fantastic wines! The staff was very friendly. If you're in or around Nob Hill and looking for a delicious meal, you should definitely try Keiko...they will be a Michelin rated restaurant., 'I used to live down the block from Keiko back when it was the pseudo-classy-but-sort-of-creepy Le Club. The new owners have managed to create an experience that is actually classy, not at all creepy, and was one of the best fine dining meals Ie had in San Francisco.When we arrived, we were greeted by the friendly hosts who took our coats and whisked us to our table, inferring who we were by our arrival time. The dining room has a hushed intimacy to it. Imagine walking into a stately residential dining room but one where everyone is eating at separate tables. The ceilings are low, the clientele is a bit older and the waiters are quieting moving around in nice suits. The tasting menu was presented to us, the epic wine list opened then almost immediately shut (I always just trust recommendations when the list is this serious) and the service began. Each course was incredible with a couple standouts: the espresso foie gras and the scallops. I sprung for the fresh truffle upgrade on the scallops which I would highly recommend; it not often you get to try truffles of this quality and shaved onto your food with this gleaming gold truffle shaver. The pacing was great and after about 3 hours and 9 courses, we were full, tipsy and happy. We ended our meal with a nice conversation with the owner about his other restaurants, his wine collection and some of the dishes they prepared. Normally the business owner chit chat feels a bit forced and pretentious, but at Keiko the guy was casual, interesting and friendly. The final bill here puts Keiko squarely in the special occasion category, but I would definitely recommend the splurge.', 'right to it.yes.yes.and yes.this place is all about french japanese influenced yes.tasting menu, 2.4.12.... Yesdelicious? Yes.three wine pairing levels? yes. i went with the grand pairing. interesting delicious fun.outstanding wine list with a very personable sommelier? yes.would you like some shaved perigord truffles with that nearly perfect seared hokkaido scallop with uni dish? yes.will we be back! yes.the dining room is small, the menu was outstanding, interesting and fun.i can wait to come back and dine off their bar menu.great addition to the sf food scene. go before this becomes the next impossible to get tables joint.and dude, bradley from the ana mandara days works here now! awesome.', I brought my s.o. here just last night for our Valentine's Day dinner. The tasting menu is amazing. The setting is perfect for a calm, intimate dinner for two. We are thinking of coming back here for a treat in the lounge. The staff are fantastic and welcoming, the atmosphere is decadently elegant and the food is so delightful, you'll already be planning your next trip here before you leave. The food is delicious beyond description. Chef Keiko has a way of highlighting the most subtle flavors in her dishes, and the flavor progression is pure art. I recommend savoring each bite slowly, as that is the way to really experience the flavor progression. We are going to recommend this lovely restaurant to our friends for their special occasions., Yumtastic. Loved their foie gras with espresso sauce, Keiko's trademark dish. Gobble it up before the insipid law goes into effect July 1, 2012., 'RUN HERE, don walk. Go now. Before they blow up. Actually please don. I want it to remain accessible for the time being. For I know that soon this place will be packed. So, STAY AWAY! I think I am bipolar. NO, I not.I heard about this place when it opened in November. This Japanese inspired French cuisine restaurant was opened by a married couple who were former owners of El Paseo before they sold it off to Tyler Florence. Keiko, the wife and the chef, is said to be the first US female chef to earn a Michelin star back in 2010. She small in stature, unassuming, and very humble and nice. The husband Seigo is equally nice and runs the front of the house, is the sommelier, and also makes wine for the restaurant. My buddy and I met both of them as we spent a few hours in their bar area continually eating off the bar menu. And when I say bar menu, it is not your regular bar menu. The soft boiled egg that accompanies the oh-so-tender pork belly has a meticulous 3-step process. And yes, it tasted damn good. Everything from the Oyster Gratin which is like an Oyster Rockefeller (but better) to the Cow Tongue (yes, tongue!!!) was simply amazing. I don use amazing when describing food too much, but this one was deserving. The dining room menu is different. An 8 course tasting menu for $88, and I hear it amazing as well. Though it sounds like a fancy place, it not too stuffy or pretentious. Very warm and inviting. GO NOW! No, please don...', 'This place is simply wonderful. We had the pleasure of sitting in the bar area and were treated with incredible warmth. The entire staff was wonderfully knowledgeable about the food and fantastic wine list. The owner himself, who touched base with us throughout most of the evening, has this restaurant in San Francisco; as well as, one in Tokyo. He had immense knowledge of the wine list, as he has collected them over the past 30years, and of the unqiue Japanes-French fusion food he served in his restaurant.  It would be important to note that we are quite particular and with that being said we would happily recommend this place to anyone!', Ooooooh la la. What a jewel Keiko is! We came here on Feb 15 for our date night, wanting something new and good. From the intimate dining room -- 7 tables -- the effusive service, the amazing food and inestimable wine pairings, and the romantic ambiance: the evening was nothing short of the ultimate dining experience.We can't wait to come back with our gourmet friends., 'Once in awhile, a restaurant comes along and you wonder where has it been all your life. Chef Keiko Takahashi and her wine connoisseur husband, Seigo Takei, opened this quaint Japanese influenced French restaurant hidden inside a San Francisco old world Nob Hill building back in November 2011. The couple credential is impressive, former chef and owner of El Paseo who later sold the Michelin starred restaurant to Tyler Florence. The six-course tasting dinner began with a glass of champagne and an amuse bouche presented in a simple wine glass. A carrot and sorbet that is light and refreshing, the amuse bouche immediately set the tone for the rest of the dinner. Simple, fresh ingredients paired in ways to highlight the best quality they have to offer. (yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_)The Extravagance de Fermier Salad began our coursed dinner. Golden beets, red beets, artichoke, brussels sprouts, sugar peas, green pea hummus, red bell pepper puree, caramelized almonds, and curry mayonnaise decorate the plate like art. The dish well deserves its name, an extravagant salad executed flawlessly. (yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_) The salad was paired with a 1991 Chateau Woltner Chardonnay. Chateau Woltner used the first vines grown in St. Helena and the winery is no longer around. (yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_)Chef Keiko signature dish, Pan Seared Artisan Foie Gras with Espresso Sauce was the highly anticipated highlight of the menu. Accompanied with artichoke and Japanese sweet potato puree, the foie gras was accented with a lightly espresso flavored sauce that complimented the buttery, fatty flavors of the foie gras. (yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_) Paired with the a Cabernet Sauvignon from the couple private winery and not your usual sauternes, the pairing was surprising and more than complimentary. The owl graphic on the wine label was commissioned by Harry Potter illustrator, a close friend of the couple and the wine is not distributed to the public.okkaidoScallop with Sea Urchin, our third course of the night, was a perfect pairing of scallop and uni. The Hokkaido cold water gives the scallop a more complex flavor while the sea urchin boldness adds punches to the dish.. (yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_)With an option to add winter black truffle to our fourth course, we could not pass up the opportunity. Black Angus Rib Eye Roti, a lightly dry aged rib eye served with gratin daffinois, was given a generous shaving of winter black truffle. (yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_) The meat was a perfect rare to medium rare which lends the most tender and flavorful bites. The winter black truffle added touches of earthiness to the rib eye. (yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_) Paired with La Chouette Burgundy style Pinot Noir (my personal favorite style of the variety) which is also from the ownersprivate winery, complemented the earth of the black truffle impeccably. (yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_)We moved to the fromage course with Gateau au Fromage. Mimolette, cream cheese, mandarinquats, fennel confit , walnuts, dried chderries, dates and brioche sable, it was almost a play on cheesecake and graham cracker crust. (yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_) Rich and creamy in the perfect portion and paired with a sweet sauternes, this could be one of the cleverest cheese courses Ie had experienced. (yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_)We finished our meal with a white chocolate confection. White Chocolate Mousse with Cardamom Ice Cream, Poached Quince & Cranberries. (yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_) The little caramelized cranberries were so amazing that I wouldn mind having just a candy dish full as dessert. Paired with a 10-year Port Tawny, it tied the entire dinner together. (yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_)If that was not enough, Seigo brought out a couple of Cannele Bordelais for us. Rich custardy interior enclosed by a thin caramelized shell made from antique French cast, these definitely top off the dinner. (yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_)From the old world dd9cor, flawless execution, impeccable wine pairing, to the exceptional service, Keiko d6 Nob Hill is well on its way to receive its Michelin star.', I wish Yelp had half-star ratings. I would give Keiko 4.5 stars, instead of 4 (and Commonwealth 2.5 instead of 3).Fun, varied, beautiful food, with great flavors.The most amazing wine list I've ever encountered (and at surprisingly-reasonable prices for vintage offerings).Gorgeous setting, in the 'lounge' of the Art Deco Clay-Jones building atop Nob Hill.The only dings are due to stuffy, somewhat imposing, albeit always-professional, service.Add more warmth and personability in the wait staff, and this becomes a unreservedly five-star gem., Food was fantastic, decor was the cutest I've seen in a long time. Dark wood interior with lace curtains and plush leather seats. Romantic and also business appropriate. Loved the experience, may be top 1 or 2 resturant in SF. Chef use to have a Michelin Star before previous restaurant was sold. Dessert was also amazing, baked inside antique moldings with wax, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Will definitely go back.ore previous restaurant was sold. Dessert was also amazing, baked inside antique moldings with wax, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Will definitely go back., A glass of champagne and three glasses of wine later, I'm pretty sure every person working at Keiko a Nob Hill last night knew that I'd just had the best meal of my life. But when you get the chance to praise the chef, Keiko, herself table-side at meal's end, you don't hold back (especially not after all that wine).Everything about this place impressed from start to finish. When the owner himself pours you your first glass of champagne and shares the details of the restaurant's history while you wait for your table to be prepared, you know you're about to experience something special.The main dining room was very small, cozy, and intimate. The service was as attentive as possible, and the dishes were presented in a well timed manner and described in great detail (antique cake pan, really?)I loved every dish, but one in particular (okay, maybe two) is worth mentioning - Chef Keiko's signature dish, the foie gras. I'm not the biggest fan of foie gras, but this dish was perhaps my favorite of the night. Served with an espresso sauce, the slight bitterness of the sauce complimented the sweetness of the foie gras perfectly. The other was the mini custard cake served at the end... why don't they have these at the bakery near my house?? If they did, I'd have one every morning with my coffee. Sooo, so good. When I find myself back in San Francisco again, I will make a special effort to have dinner here. Until then, I will be disappointed in all other foie gras, and searching for antique cake pans and custard cake recipes., 'This place gets my rare and coveted 6 star award, along with Yume and Wakuriya. Magical.The ingredients are top notch and meticulously cared for by the owners. It shows up in the taste. Service was very good. The owner came by and answered my (many detailed) questions about the food. That was really fun.BTW as someone else mentioned, there public parking on Washington, the left hand side; youe got to watch for it because it not that big. It was $10 for up to 2 hours, $15 until midnight.', 'Simply amazing.', * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ 2013 MICHELIN STAR CANDIDATE ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ *My Chinese mom may not have effectively instilled in me the value of a dollar but there is one thing I will always take away from her nagging, I mean, life lessons: ALWAYS trust your intuition. ALWAYS. After having one of the most phenomenal meals in my life on Friday, I'm dedicating my ***800th Review*** to Keiko a Nob Hill which without a doubt will be awarded a Michelin Star in 2013. Opened in November 2011, Keiko is owned by the former owners of El Paseo (yelp.com/biz/el-paseo-mi43_). Before selling El Paseo to my imaginary future husband Tyler Florence in 2010, Chef Keiko Takahashi and husband/business partner Seigo Takei received one Michelin Star for their French restaurant. A French-Japanese restaurant, Keiko serves a Japanese Izakaya (tapas) Style Menu in their bar/lounge area and a French Tasting Menu in their formal dining room. If you love French cuisine but appreciate the delicateness of Japanese cuisine then you cannot go wrong with the seasonal tasting menu. And, if you're a wine connoisseur then you will go gaa-gaa over their 5,000+ vintage wine collection. SEVEN COURSE TASTING MENU - $85A culinary mastermind, Chef Takahashi created seven unparalleled dishes. Each one was like a painting on a plate; artistically compiled with simple ingredients with eye-catching vibrant colors and then layered, creating a complexity of flavors while still maintaining the integrity of each ingredient.yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_(1) Carrot Trip: Carrot Chiffon Cake, Carrot Blanc Manger & Pickled Carrotyelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_From the fluffy sponge cake, the velvety smooth blanc manger to the tongue tantalizing pickled carrot, the carrot shined in each component. (2) Trois Ensemble of Dungeness Crab w/ Tomato Coulis, Red Bell Pepper Mousse & Green Peas Pureeyelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_Dungeness crab alone is divine but the subtleness of the tomato, red bell pepper, and green peas in different forms was like the ocean sea meeting a country vegetable garden. (3) Seared Artisan Foie Gras w/ Espresso Sauceyelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_Alone, foie gras can be overwhelming rich so normally both a carb and a fruit component are needed. However, the pairing of the foie gras and the espresso was absolutely genius. The subtle bitterness from the espresso perfectly balanced the luxurious richness of the foie gras. (4) Duo of Black Angus Ribeye 'Deux Cuissons': Braised Rib, Ribeye Roti & Wild Mushrooms w/ Black Shaved Truffles (+$40 supplement)yelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_Though different cooking techniques were used for the duo, both the ribeye and the braised rib were seamlessly soft and melted on my palate. An additional $40, I savored each delicate Pd9rigord black truffle flake which gave the beef a wonderful subtle earthiness. (5) Fourme D'Ambert Cheese: Pate Filo, Rhubarb, Mustard Green & Arugula Saladyelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_Inside the deliciously flakey filo dough, the bleu cheese and fig mixture was a savory sweet lover's dream. (6) Red Wine Guimauve w/ Raspberry, Mint Ice Cream, Vanilla Foam & Sugar Tuileyelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_A symphony of flavors and textures, the fluffy guimauve, refreshing mint ice cream, fragrant vanilla foam and crisp sugar tuile was like the Beethoven of all desserts, (7) Cannele Bordelais: Cake w/ Custard Filling enclosed by a Caramelized Shellyelp.com/biz_photos/6ZNl43_If cake and crd2me brulee had a love child, the cannele bordelias would be it.

I surprise with all the 5 stars review. We were excited to try this place but it was quite disappointing. Well, it was just OK nothing spectacular.1 star for ambiance-it very intimate and classy1 star for presentation-beautiful like art1 star for the blue cheese & filo/fig confectionMy husband had wine pairing with his dinner. The sommelier was knowledable but seemed little spacey at times. There was one pairing that did not go well with the dish. It was almost disgusting it smelled like stinky feet. The food was just ok. It wasn memorable. I think the BIGGEST turned off was the owner (husband) did not greet/knowledge us at all. There were about 7-8 tables in the dining room. (imagine how intimate) We were seated right in the middle of the room (nice STAR table) The husband/owner made small chats to EVERY SINGLE table EXCEPT for us. Japanese people are very polite and hospitable but we didn feel any love. We don expect any ass kissing because we paid over $300 for dinner. I think even at your neighborhood ma and pa restaurant you still get a thank you. Il probably get hate emails after I post this but Im speaking from our experience. As for us, we will never come back.', Overall, the food at Keiko was tasty, pretty, and fairly simple though plated beautifully. The first course, a martini glass with sorbet, cooked carrots and a tuile cookie, was whimsical, mesmerizing and tasty. On the other hand, the seared rib eye with potatoes au gratin was exactly as described and fairly boring. Thanks to the scallops at Keiko, I now know that a $40 truffle supplement, while fun, and plentiful, is lost on me.The one stand out was the seared foie gras with espresso reduction. Sour and bitter reduction melting in with incredibly tender liver. It was perfect.The servers tried a little to hard, and I didn't love that the wine the somolier chose for my one glass was one of the most expensive on the menu. It was also eerily quiet througout the room when we arrived at 5:30 on a Sunday. I now know a lot about life of the trio sitting accross the room. I also know that the kitchen and servers were very flexible for a the nut-allergic, no-raw-meat, diabetic woman sitting next to us.Avoid parking by taking the cable car from Embarcadero BART., Great place, great food, great ambiance!That's all I have to say about this amazing restaurant!, I had the best experience here. The ambiance was spectacular. Very european inspired with a splash of Japanese accents here and there. Reservations made on open table, but you could potentially call he restaurant to see if there any cancellations. The owner and his staff are very welcoming and professional. Every so often the owner would give a nice explanation of his wine parings. I must admit that the wine pairings are phenomenal. And he produces his own wine, so extra brownie points for that.We had the dinner menu, and it was nothing less than amazing. Oysters, salad, foie gras, scallop with uni, aged rib eye, brioche au fromage, and a crazy dessert ice creme combo. Last was some sort of cake with a caramelized shell. I didn't give much of a description but when you taste the food... The descriptions won't matter.. :)Towards the end of our meal the chef came out and greeted our table. It was a a wonderful dinner and I had a great time! Make sure u make a reservation... Thanks for reading and hope this helps!, My foodie friend claims that the food at Keiko is even better than French Laundry. We had some dishes at the bar and I was duly impressed. My favorite was the Shigoku Oyster Gratin, which tastes very similar to Oyster Rockefeller. The Chanterelle Mushroom Risotto was really delicious too but I prefer my risotto to be cooked a little more than the traditional al dente way. The Braised Pork Belly was ok. It was a little too cooked and chewy for me, not enough melt in your mouth fatty goodness. The crab cakes were very fresh and tasted like the crabs were picked fresh from Fisherman's wharf that day. We also had some really good beer. For $22 a bottle, it better be. I would love to come back here for a full dinner next time., $85 tasting menu is a good value for the quality and presentation of the courses. The best courses were the foie gras with espresso reduction, the rib-eye served two ways (perfection!), a bleu cheese in phyllo purse that is the best I have ever tasted (it is a skill to elevate a dish you've had countless times to a completely new experience), and a French cannele that was the perfect combination of crisp exterior, soft, custardy interior. There was also a mint ice cream in the dessert that was pure essence of mint. Amazing. I give it 4, not 5 stars, because there is some room for improvement. They offer 3 wine pairing options at 3 price points, but there is no list of the wines that will be served that night. We opted for the $85 pairing (the others were higher), and the wines were all very good. The sommelier was knowledgeable, and we enjoyed discussing each of the pairings that he brought, so it turned out well, but more info up front would be welcome. We found ourselves uncertain of which way to go with wine when we were first seated, and we would have appreciated more direction. Service was good -- all items were delivered to the table at the same time. The only misfire there was that nobody offered us coffee or espresso after our dessert course. The Chef came to the table at the end of the meal to say hello, and she was charming. I will definitely be back -- I'd like to try the bar area with the Japanese dishes., The ambiance .. cozy. reminded me of a tiny version of lounge at Ritz Carlton. you must whisper during the courses if you don't want anyone else in the restaurant to listen to your conversation. Food ... I've definitely had better. At least when I dined, every dishes were fixed sweeter. (Besides the wonderful dish of Foie Gras with espresso sauce. ), I would not give another grand introduction since most reviews already mentioned about Chef Keiko's background. We had a reservation and chef's tasting menu was the designated choice. We did not do wine pairing and decided it was better to select our own champagnes and wines for our party of 6. They offered a very good champagne and wine selection. Some were limited production and exclusive wines. I even saw some limited ones from Kenzo Winery in Napa. Every dish was artistically and elegantly prepared for chef's tasting menu. The scallops were cooked to perfection and tasted exquisite with the truffle, which was an extra add on. The cheese course was very light and creatively interpreted from traditional French cuisine. The cannele bordelais was a nice touch at the end. It had a wonderful custard like in the center... very yummy if you are into custard. My small disappointments were not being able to taste the Oyster soup (Shigoku) during my visit and Chef Keiko's signature dish, foie gras with espresso sauce, was not a dish my dining partners nor I could give stellar review. Most of us found the espresso sauce a bit too bitter, except for my DH and another friend who absolutely enjoyed every last bite. However, the espresso sauce cut the richness of the foie gras and tinge of gaminess nicely... brilliant touch! Overall, it was an elegant and memorable experience :) It was definitely more modern French with slight Japanese influence rather than kaiseki that other reviewers had noted. I would love to try the bar/izakaya menu next time. Although I could no longer compare Chef Keiko's current menu to the one from El Paseo, Chef Keiko should definitely receive another Michelin Star at this new restaurant!!, The folks at Keiko have really created a spectacular experience for their guests. From the moment you come in the door to the moment you leave, you feel like you've gone to an old friends house, except the food is better than anything my friends have ever cooked. The restaurant has multiple dining rooms, each with a few tables and decorated more like an old house with modern furniture than a restaurant. When you are seated, the only option you have is what you want to drink. We chose to order wine by the glass rather than the $85 pairing and each person who took our drink order was extremely knowledgeable about their list and more than happy to suggest a wine that wold pair well with the next couple of courses. The entire menu was fantastic from the carrot three ways, to the caneles, especially the optional additional dish of deboned rabbit stuffed with foie gras and truffles ($30). I will definitely come back, if not for the tasting, to sit at the bar and order a la carte. I was worried that the bar would have a long wait on a Saturday night, but I didnt see anyone there the entire time I was there. I'm actually worried about writing this on Yelp because I dont want the bar section to start filling up but the food is so good that more people need to experience Chef Keiko's food., 'Thoroughly enjoyed the meal. We had the seven course meal and everything was delicious, the most notable courses were:Foie gras with espresso sauce: As mentioned repeatedly on all the reviews, this is delicious! It was very tender and the espresso sauce adds a nice flavor to the dish. The brioche that accompanies the foie gras is also cooked perfectly.Cheese dish: I usually dislike blue cheese, but this was the exception. Probably because it was wrapped in this delicious filo.Cannele: Perfect combination of the hard caremlized shell and the vanilla custard.We got there a little earlier than our reservation and got seated right away. The service was great, with the courses timed well and the servers checking on us often.', We ate there last night 4/14/12. Everything written about Keiko is spot on. This is the place you go for a special occasion or if you want the heighth of service, ambiance and taste.Party of 4. Extraordinary gastric delight. The presentation, each course described perfectly by the staff, down to the smallest dot on the plate. The wine selection was superb and we really felt special .Our head waiter , Robbie, was a delight, entertaining, knowledgeable and very friendly. Although this is high end dining, there was no boorish, snobby beahaviour here. Also, Keiko's husband, Seigo, talked to us at least 15 min. telling us about selling El Paseo, waiting to sign the lease and then opening up Keiko. Very nice , and down to earth. We wanted to meet Keiko, but it was ver y busy , so he told us to come a little later next time so could could meet her. I am glad we found this new gem, because as word gets out it will be tough to get a reservation. 5 Stars to Keiko's. Bon Apetit !!!!!, When I was enjoying Keiko's dishes, I had one thought: in the world of extraordinary writers, there are very few females who excel, much like the modern day culinary world. Let's not dive into the social, economic, patriarchal reasons behind the centuries of gender inequality, because this is yelp, which isn't exactly the right platform for that sort of discussion. But let's face it, there are a lot more great male writer/chefs than female writer/chefs. However, when a female writer is successful in what she does, I find myself so drawn to the delicate and feminine quality of her work. And that's what I was thinking when I tasted Keiko's dishes. They are as good but different from dishes I've had from amazing male chefs. It's like she thought about her dishes in a very well-rounded way (like any good chef would), from the ingredients to the presentation to the editing and refinement, and then she took the time, and thought about it, again. Yes, it's that thoughtfulness and extreme attention to detail that sets her apart. The foie gras with espresso sauce is as good as the hype. The heavy, bitter, strong, and rich sauce is the only thing that can balance the extreme fat. I liked her crab dish which was light and showcased crab's natural and delicate sweetness. And the side of asparagus and edible flowers is extremely pretty. The meats were surprisingly good to someone who never orders red meat. The steak was juicy and flavorful while the rib eye was fall-of-the-bone tender.The only dish that underwhelmed me was the dessert. I understand that after foie gras and red meat, you may not want to push a piece of chocolate cake up someone's artery, but if I were to spent calories eating dessert, I don't really want marshmellow and fruity stuff. I want the sinful stuff, like buttery cobbler or flourless chocolate cake. The service was as formal as the decor of the place. I definitely didn't feel like I was dining in SF, but somewhere in Manhattan. The room where you can reserve seats and order the tasting menu only seats about 10, so whatever you talk about, will be intimately shared with those nine around you. So lower your voice and choose your subjects wisely., I vacillated between giving Keiko a Nob Hill four or five stars, the food is definitely five star. I'd be shocked if they don't get a Michelin Star. Yes, the foie gras dish is very good, but the standouts for me were the rabbit/porcini mushroom special and the ribeye dish. The two desserts weren't up to the standard of the rest of the meal though.So why not five stars? Our table was HUGE, so I felt that I was 2 miles away from my wife. As previous reviewers have mentioned you hear every conversation in the dining room since everyone has to speak up, this means that they hear yours too. Not good for an intimate dinner out. Go to Keiko a Nob Hill with a pack of food friends, don't go on a date I say. Also, No cocktails here, beer (2 types!) and wine only.There is a parking garage on the corner, no valet. Will we go back? Absolutely! The food was incredible., It was a nice small restaurant, similar to the boulevard. The husband was basically the host and the wife was the chef. Being that I was in the dining room, prefix menu was required but you can still order from the bar menu. I chose the prefix menu with paired wines. I have to say hands down, the pairing was exquisite (5 stars). The hostess knew what he was doing, I just can't get enough. Being that I ordered some sushi items, the hostess provided sake too. From the bar menu, I ordered Amberjack sashimi and an Uni dish. The amberjack was so fresh and good (5 stars). The uni which came with some kind of tofu soaked with miso broth. It was good, but the broth took away the taste of the uni (3.5 stars). Now to the prefix menu, overall it was good with some items that were so and so.- 1st dish was carrot cake with carrot moose (1 star): There were no flavors in either dishes, it was so one dimensional. The cake tasted like any other sponge cake.- The crab dish with squid crush, had sides of different mousses (2 stars): The crab was fresh, but it lacked flavor by itself. The dish had two different types of mousses that didn't compliment each other. However, if you take one mouse and eat it with the crab then there was some flavor. I think there was too much going on with this dish.- Foie Gras (4 stars): it was a nice portion and the espresso sauce complemented the dish really well.- Duo Black Angus Rib Eye (5 stars): The braised beef was very tender and tasty. The rib eye was also yummy, cooked perfectly. The mash potato was pretty good.- Cheese dish: I thought it was okay, nothing spectacular (2 stars).Overall, I'll give the food 3.5 stars. It was a nice experience but I wished the food was more dynamic., Another 3.5 rounded up to 4 thanks to the wonderful service and ambiance at Keiko. They only offer a 7 course prix fixe for $85, with 3 different wine pairings to choose from: $85 (regular wine paring), $125 (Grand pairing), or $290 (Magnifique pairing). However, there is an option to order a la carte if you dine in their Lounge Area. We made reservations for a party of three at 5:45pm on a Saturday night, and were seated promptly. Although this was the only option available to choose from on Opentable, the restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived. The prix fixe for April 2012 included--Carrot 'Trio' (Carrot Chiffon Cake, Carrot Blanc Manger, Pickled Carrot): One of the best dishes of the night! The carrot blanc manger was a carrot mousse on top of a dollop of carrot puree served in a stylish martini glass- the mousse portion was so light and airy that it melted on my tongue, but still imparted a sweet carrot taste. The carrot puree had more substance/body, and a concentrated sweet carrot taste. The chiffon cake was also delicious, but I wished the piece weren't so tiny!-Trois Ensemble of Dungeness Crab (Tomato Coulis and Red Bell Pepper Mousse): The crab was layered in between small circular tuilles made from squid ink. Although the crab was plentiful and tasted really fresh, it was hard to break the tuille down, and the broken pieces had really jagged/sharp edges that made the dish diffcult to eat. I felt the flavors in this dish didn't work very well together, and was one of my least favorite.-Pan Seared Artisan Foie Gras w/ Espresso Sauce (Chef Keiko's Signature Dish: Accompanied w/ Artichoke and Japanese Sweet Potato Puree): The foie gras was YUM! It was seared perfectly and still warm when they brought it out. This dish also comes with a tiny brioche so that you can soak up the foie gras fat. I thought the espresso sauce was overly bitter, which detracted from the sweet foie gras taste instead of balancing it. The artichoke and sweet potato puree was also too bitter, and detracted from my enjoyment of the dish.-Duo of Black Angus Rib Eye 'Deux (Braised Beef, Rib Eye Roti, Wild Mushrooms, and Truffle Sauce): Keiko ages their beef in house, for about 10 days, which I thought made the beef extra tender. Everyone enjoyed the seared rib eye more than the braised, since the braised dish was overpowered by the wine sauce. THe seared rib eye was cooked a perfect medium rare. -Fourme D'ambert Cheese (Pate Filo, Rhubarb Confit, Mustard Green and Arugula Salad)- YUCK. Worst dish of the night. I'm not a huge fan of blue cheeses, but have enjoyed most of those that I've tried at nice restaurants. However, the D'ambert cheese was very pungent, and I don't believe combined with anything to round out the flavor. It was basically a big piece of cheese wrapped and baked in phyllo. There also wasn't enough of a sauce to mix with the cheese/phyllo, so I felt this dish was very dry.Desserts:-Chocolate and Raspberry Yogurt Mousse, Mint Ice Cream: The mousse was again soft and velvety, but had more gelatin/body to it. The mint ice cream was inspired, as it gave the dessert a fresh quality when you ate it (which is what mint is supposed to do, but people rarely touch the whole mint leaves that are normally stuck on top of desserts).-Canneld9 Bordelais (A Cake w/ a Rich Custardy Interior Enclosed by a Thin Caramelized Shell): DELICIOUS- now I know why people have raved about canneld9s in the past, but I've never tried a canneld9 as delicious as the one I've had here. The caramelized shell was delicious, and the custardy interior provided a nice contrast. You could also see the vanilla bean specks in the custard.The parking around this area is definitely tough, so make sure you budget time for that. The booth seating that we got was wonderful, and actually comfortable! Service was also excellent- they kept the dinner on a good pace where we didn't feel rushed but had time to enjoy and savor our food. Overall, I'm glad I was able to experience the food artistry (all of the dishes were beautifully presented) at Keiko d6 Nob Hill, but disappointed that I didn't enjoy all of my dishes. I also agree with other reviewers that the desserts need improvement/more sophistication- although I loved the canneld9, I didn't feel it was a good dish to round out the courses. It would have been perfect as one of the mignardises. The other detraction from Keiko is there are no amuse bouches, bread, or mignardises provided, and I feel at least one of three should be present for a restaurant that only serves prix fixe dinners. In any case, the portion sizes were satisfactory, as I was full when I left the restaurant. However, my dining companions and I started to get hungry around 10pm. In any case, Keiko is a must try, but I would suggest going a la carte and ordering the dishes you want, instead of being stuck with a few that you wish you could have skipped., Excellent restaurant that is already a premier dining experience and will get better. Service was excellent, and the simple menu gives everyone less to worry about and more to enjoy.PROS:- Every course was interesting and good, although some were better than others- The tasting menu was reasonably priced ($85) considering the level of fare- Excellent serviceCONS:- Wasn't thrilled with the pacing of the meal, which had unreasonably long gaps between courses. Considering that the menu is set, I would think we would only need a few minutes between courses. Instead, I felt that we spent more time waiting than eating.TIPS:- Despite what the Yelp profile says, there is only beer and wine, not a full bar, 'This review is for the lounge, not the main dining room. Went here for a girls night out and this place was perfect! The main dining room serves a tasting menu only, but they let you order a bunch of small plates a la carte in the lounge where we stayed. There were 11 items on the lounge menu and we decided to get one of everything and share among the four of us! We started off with the Burdock inpira..this was the one that looked least appetizing on the menu but it was actually very tasty, earthy and satisfying. Maybe it seemed even more so since we were starving! Next was the Farmer Market Salad, which was light and refreshing. Third we had the Mushroom Nibitashi, which was again very earthy, with great mushroom flavor. Next was the Amberjack sashimi. It was very fresh and tasted great, though I guess there nothing that distinguishes it from sashimi at a really good sushi restaurant. Then we got Chef Keiko signature dish, pan-seared artisan foie gras with espresso sauce...this was definitely the knockout dish of the night. I thought I would taste the espresso more but it was very subtle. I only wish the portion was larger! This was the only dish that we had two orders of and unfortunately the second piece was even smaller than the first. At least I glad I got to taste it before the ban...still on a quest to eat as much foie as possible before July! Next we had the Forufuki daikon radish, which was pretty good but I have to admit a bit anticlimactic after the foie gras. The Kumiage (yuba with sea urchin) was much better...the uni was fresh and buttery, and the sauce was fabulous. Then we had the oyster gratin with spinach, bacon, and champagne cream...this was good but I think the richness of the other ingredients overpowered the oyster itself a little bit. The wild mushroom risotto that followed was perfectly cooked, with loads of mushrooms (and seems like a little bit of truffle oil)...it was delish and I could have eaten at least twice as much! The Fried chicken Tatsuta was probably one of the best versions of chicken karaage that Ie had, if not the best. The batter was so crispy but not greasy, the chicken was not overcooked and so juicy and tender. The shishito peppers went perfectly with it. Finally, we had the beef tongue Persillade, which was tasty and had a decent-sized portion and a good sauce, but I have to admit I liked the fried chicken better.For dessert, there were 3 choices and since wee such gluttons, again we got one of each. The first was a fourme dmbert cheese in a fillo pouch, accompanied by some greens/flowers. It looked gorgeous and tasted even better. This was probably my favorite dessert out of the three. There was a chocolate dessert which came with some caramel(?) ice cream, which was good but I think a bit forgettable...I would probably have preferred it to be a little darker and more bitter. There was also a panna cotta with some mango sorbet and small pieces of mango...I not the biggest fan of fruity desserts but my friends enjoyed it.We ordered two bottles of wine, the first was a Pinot that they recommended and it was pretty reasonably priced compared to the rest of the list (~$80), and for our second wine we got a Gigondas which was even cheaper (didn want to pay more for the second bottle!) Both wines were good, though I enjoyed the Pinot better and it went with more of the dishes. Since the wines we chose were on the low end, the whole dinner wound up costing us a little over $400 ($100/pp) after tax but before tip, which I think is a steal for the amount of food and wine we had.The service was decent but could use improvement...I not sure if this is because it the lounge, but it took them a while to refill our wine when some of us were empty (kinda wish they just left the bottle at the table if theye not going to be timely about refilling our glasses). I also wish that the plates would have come more slowly, perhaps 1-2 at a time as opposed to getting as much food as would fit in our table all at once. I not sure if they were just trying to turn the table but it seemed like there was plenty of empty space at the bar so we didn feel bad lingering. Though they were sometimes hard to find though, the servers we encountered were all pretty friendly and nice.I do want to try the dining room (hopefully before they get the Michelin star they probably will get), probably when it just me and the hubby. I think for a group though it much better to hang out in the lounge, since you can try more dishes. Also it was a good option for us since we couldn plan too far ahead to make reservations on time. I think the lounge was especially suited for a girls night out since the food was relatively light and we didn feel bloated/disgusting in the end (not sure heavy eaters would enjoy as much). I would definitely go back and I highly recommend this place for a special occasion!', I don't know if you have to run here as suggested by Adolfo L., but this definitely was a solid fine dining experience with top notch service.The 7-course tasting menu was creative with some hits and misses.HITS: Trois ensemble of Dungeness crab, which the menu notes is accompanied by tomato coulis and red bell pepper mousse. But, it was the squid ink layers in between the mini mounds of crab that did it for me.Pan seared artisan foie gras with espresso sauce is apparently Chef Keiko's signature dish, and after a few bites, it was obvious why. The expresso sauce really helps cut the sometimes overwhelming fattiness of the foie gras.Duo of black angus rib eye 'Deux: Braised beef, rib eye roti, wild mushrooms, and truffle sauce. The braised beef was so tender and flavorful. I didn't really have much room for the seared cut of rib eye, so I asked them to box it up, which they forgot . . . the only snag of the night, which I didn't discover until I got home.Fourme d'ambert cheese: Pate filo stuffed with some delicious blue cheese from France, I think. Loved it. But, I love anything deep fried and I love blue cheese, so this dish couldn't go wrong for me.MISSES: First course of green stuff accompanied with a liquid shot of green stuff; warm on top, cool on bottom. Tasted too healthy for me.The last two courses were sweet, and sweet things don't really do it for me. I wish they would have some non-sweet options since they only provide the 7- course option in the dining room. For example, Michael Mina has a 3 or 4 course lunch menu, but for the last course, you can choose from 3 or 4 sweet options or a cheese dish.It's $85 for the set 7-course menu, and with 2 bottles of $80ish bottles of wine, our grand total was roughly $165/person (including tip)., 'Hours after taking my very last law school final, I celebrated by enjoying a fine meal at Keiko a Nob Hill. I booked the reservation a few weeks in advance, indicating that it was a celebration dinner, and I was really pleased at the special table and luxurious chairs they set up for us in a corner of the restaurant. The dessert course had Congratulations written with chocolate as well. Sweet touch.I not going to write a novel describing each dish. I feel like Cherylynn N. reviews give a great rundown on the dishes from the tasting menu. The amuse bouche we had on Saturday wasn a carrot trio, but peas made in two ways: a custard topped with peas, fava beans, and flowers (I didn write the descriptions down, so this is just from memory) and a pea shooter which was multilayered and went from hot to cold. The foie gras with espresso sauce was definitely my favorite dish, and I loved the piece of brioche provided for sopping up all the leftover sauce and juices. Our server told us that Chef Takahashi spent 20 years perfecting this recipe and it truly was perfecting. Each course was perfectly plated and well balanced. I was afraid that I would leave a little bit hungry, but I left feeling completely satisfied. Although one might assume that this place is really stuffy and pretentious, I found it to be warm. I came straight from an exam so I was afraid that I would be dressed too casually (blouse, statement necklace, black pants) but I didn feel underdressed. Overall, a superb dining experience. Many thanks to the chef and staff for the lovely celebration dinner.', 'My husband and I went here for my birthday a while back and we seriously had one of the BEST meals of my life here. It was back in January in the main dining room, but I still remember it vividly - each course was perfectly portioned and beautifully styled. And the beef course! Honestly the most perfect piece of beef Ie ever had - it was seriously heaven (and I am not that big on steak usually). They also have an incredibly impressive wine collection that is remarkably reasonable in pricing, considering the rare vintages! Definitely pricey with all courses and wine - but a great special occasion restaurant and one of the must-go places in SF.', It was a perfect ending to a beautiful day in SF. It's nice an quiet here and you can actually carry on a conversation. The place is located in what looks like either a hotel or a private residence. We got the foie gras with the espresso sauce. After your first bite, you will want to scream. It was perfect! You can perfectly taste the foie gras and the espresso sauce. So if you are a coffee lover, this dish is a MUST. You will not regret it. Well actually, you might regret not getting enough of it. My mine entree was the Pork Belly. It was juicy and it didn't a lot a fat, just the way i like it. I hope to come back to this place and try the prix. menu. The service here is superb, all the waiters and even the owner was very attentive . oh how i still dream of the foie gras dish, my daily espresso will never be the same again., Great presentation.One of the bests I've seen.The Taste... Eh.The atmosphere is pretty somewhat stuffy.Actually it gets pretty stuffy because everything slows down.The service, people, etc.The highlight was the sommelier. The Sommelier... was a POS... More on that later.Foie gras was great (a part of the pre fix course).The rest was mediocre at best.Without looking at the pictures of that night, I can't recall what I ate.The chef sure likes cream/mousse/etc stuff. Nothing bad, Japanese creams are the best and adds up very nicely to the presentation.Sure each of those plates looked beautiful, but the #1 concern of food should be taste.More of an eye candy than food. A great wine list, but the sommelier was so full of himself to entertain me with wines. If he had been nice, I could have ordered several good bottles even though I'd never finish them, but no. Instead, he gave me wines by glass without explaining anything... Just handed me the glass and ran off before I say anything.What kinda service was that???Just because I let him pick, did he think I don't know shit about wine?I was so tired so I let the sommelier pick wines for me for my main and dessert, I didn't want to try their wine pairing however. Was that my fault?Only one time, I almost had him to answer my question like where was the winery located at coz the wine sure tasted like the cab near mountain side of St. Helena. He told me which winery it was and just ran off...But there were only 3 tables at that time, he had no other customers to run off to. When I pay $20+ per glass, they certainly charged so, I want good experiences with each. I don't care about the price if the whole experience is good, but I tried not to spit when I walk out coz it was a date night.There are way better restaurants in the city. Too bad the chef makes the plate like a piece of art.Too bad that seems to be the first or the only consideration instead of the taste. So, I told myself that I paid almost $200 for EACH order of foie gras and other crap to fill my hunger and sour feeling about their service. Would u spend almost $400 here or other fine dining in the city where you think you are being treated nicely? No brainer., I took my fiance to Keiko d6 Nob Hill for our third anniversary and it was the perfect choice.We were seated in the smaller of the two dining rooms, to the left of the main entrance, which only contained four or five small tables. It was the perfect intimate setting for the occasion.The food was absolutely flawless. I'm not going to go crazy describing every course but there were a few highlights:-Trois of Dungeness crab with tomato coulis and red bell pepper mousse: this dish was perfection in every way. Chef Keiko put together a great combination of flavor and texture without overshadowing the crab. We loved this one.-Foie gras with espresso sauce, artichoke and Japanese sweet potato puree: the flavor and preparation were excellent, I would have preferred to have the brioche integrated into the dish rather than served on the side - seemingly an afterthought - but combined they were delicious.-Duo of black angus rib eye 'Deux with wild mushrooms, and truffle sauce: normally a beef dish is the low light of a fine dining meal. I actually can't recall one truly amazing beef course at any restaurant - until this one. This dish was fantastic! The wild mushrooms and the truffle sauce worked so well with the perfectly cooked rib eye. This was another favorite for sure.So why four stars?We spent an awful lot of time with empty dishes and wine glasses in front of us. On several of the courses we had servers pass our table more than once without clearing the empty places and wine glasses. Don't get me wrong, the service wasn't bad, our servers were very friendly and helpful, the courses and wine were well timed. Correcting this minor flaw would put the meal on par with some of the best restaurants in the world that I've dined at.Overall it was a great meal and the perfect choice for our anniversary.|1
25|lazy-bear-san-francisco|Lazy Bear served up my favorite meal of 2009, handily besting Saison at a fraction of the cost, and the best of several underground restaurants I've attended. David is an extremely talented and uncompromising chef and his creations are reliably creative, without going over the top (OK, once in awhile over the top...). If you appreciate food that is made with passion, care, and with the very best ingredients, you owe it to yourself to try Lazy Bear!, i've had the opportunity to work with Lazy Bear and it was an educational and tasty experience. i loved the creativity David puts into his food and the fun that comes as a result of simply eating his dishes., 'Ie been to two of David vegetarian/vegan dinners and both were inventive, amazing, visually gorgeous, and delicious. I one of those people who scoffs at the idea of food as art, but I ready to make an exception in this case. A truly unique dining experience you won get at any traditional SF restaurant.', I have been to one of David's dinners. I went alone, but found that not to be an issue, as everyone in attendance was so welcoming and easy to talk to. I knew the food would be beautiful, since I had seen pictures of Lazy Bear food before, and I knew it would be unique. But seriously, I was craving that pork belly for months after the dinner. I still crave it... And fried soup. Really, fried soup. So amazing. Each course has a really great balance of flavors involved, with each aspect (flavor, texture, temperature) clearly chosen for a reason. You may not know what the reason is, but when you eat it, it works. I also love that David took the time to tell the diners about the courses himself so that you knew more about the process and tastes to pay attention to. I probably talked about the dinner for days afterward, prompting a few of my friends to go to a dinner a few weeks later, which they also raved about!, What a truly wonderful dining experience. I've been to two of of David's/Lazy Bear meals and both were amazing for two different reasons. The food is mouth watering, tingling-ly exciting, experimentally different, unexpected, but always very-very good., David's cooking is amazing. Every meal is an adventure, with special touches on every plate and mind-blowing flavors that you never thought could mix together, but do. His creativity is matched only by his devotion to research and preparation. After each dish, you can walk into the kitchen and chat with him about where each ingredient came from and every step of the preparation.This is an experience not to be missed! You won't regret it., This was a pretty special meal. 7 courses, with a poultry theme. I go in thinking I'm going to get a few interesting takes on chicken and turkey, but instead dive into guinea fowl, foie gras a few ways, duck, squab, and more -- the only chicken element was crispy chicken skin on a bed of greens... yes. The atmosphere is also great -- David keeps the groups fairly small (~20 people), and addresses the diners between courses. I'd definitely recommend trying out Lazy Bear if you haven't already., This is quite simply the best food in San Francisco. And yes, I'm comparing it to Gary Danko, Michael Mina, Acquerello, Fleur de Lys, Frances, etc. Sure, it's BYOB. But that just means you're not paying $200 for a $50 bottle of wine. The chef is creative, the service is fun, and the food is interesting. The only annoying part is the unbearable pain of waiting for the email to confirm you and your friends got one of the few coveted reservations available. So get on the mailing list. And sign up for dinner early., 'I took my husband for his birthday and we absolutely loved this experience!everything was unique, presented flawlessly, David explained all his dishes and the flavors really came together. His food showcases his passion and love for fine food. We also really, really enjoyed the wine/cocktail pairings. Everything was so well thought out and of the highest quality. thank you for a great experience! we will be back and bring friends. :)', My parents went to Lazy Bear they told me I need to wait for my I year anniversary to appreciate the fine food that they make. My wife didn't want to wait so I pull a rabbit out of my hat and sch for reservation. The food was spectacular and my wife and I was very impress. That you for a wounder full time, 'Increadible experience! David is amazing! Each dish was delicious and artistic. You can taste the love that it is all made with. I would repeat the evening in a heartbeat!', Perhaps it's only a matter of time until the underground restaurant trend becomes the norm de rigueur, and we see cities sporting legions of veritable restaurants on the go. Perhaps restaurants will spring up like ninjas in our cities, descending like silent assassins but bearing pork belly and creative greenery. Hard to say exactly if that would be a good thing or otherwise, but it's hard to argue that it would be exciting.For their part, Lazy Bear creates a leisurely dining experience in the non-restaurant space of your (or presumably their) choosing, and I was fortunate enough to experience the palate dance they provided with some colleagues after a long day of shop talk. They transformed a fairly dingy industrial space into something more closely resembling a thin-lit dining room, and by the time the food arrived, the wine was flowing and the conversations were too. Highlights included the sweet corn soup and raw spot prawn: Chef David's presentation wasn't relegated to the food alone; in between courses, he'd step out of the kitchen and tell the tales of what cuisine was to come next. And he regularly welcomed diners back into the kitchen to see where the magic was happening. I've never been snuck up on by a restaurant before, but I can be sure that if this one happened again, we'd be all smiles and old pals by the time it was over., 'Chef David serves high class food in a casual setting and gives you a guided tour of the meal and its preparation. He even invites his guests to wander into the kitchen at any time to ask questions. He and his staff are incredibly friendly and informative as they make you feel like you are stepping into their home for a family meal.Each month the menu changes so here are some highlights from our evening. Bacon infused whipped eggs with maple syrup aka breakfast in a shot glass, perfectly cooked scallops with bacon XO finishing sauce, killer brussel sprouts, miso soup with greens he had foraged locally, and cured tombo to name a few. We brought our own wine and beer with some helpful suggestions from the chef a few days prior. All in all, it was a 5 star meal in a comfy, unpretentious atmosphere and was a truly unique experience.', This is my first Yelp review. Why you ask? Because this experience was so awesome that I just had to sign up and post about it. 1. Chef David is a food genius. My boyfriend and I have eaten at a multitude of Michelin restaurants (from 1-3 star), and by far this was one of the best experiences we have ever had. The food was amazing from start to finish, and there were several times in which my boyfriend had to hold me back from literally licking my plate. You can tell that everything Chef David and his team do is from the heart.2. If you want amazing food, come here. If you expect to have your napkin folded 3.5 seconds after you leave to use the restroom, go elsewhere. This place is about sharing the experience of enjoying amazing food. No one will be there to fold your napkin (who really cares about those things though?), but they will invite you into the kitchen at any time during the meal and let you chat with them. 3. The dining experience was something completely unique. After walking past a small pirate radio station on your way in, you find yourself in an eclectically decorated space with two communal tables. You sit family style with others who are just as nerdy about eating good food as you are. Eating good food and talking to people who love eating good food, win-win!4. In the beginning of the meal I asked my boyfriend why he thought it was called Lazy Bear. By the end of the meal I am pretty sure I had answered my question. After about 10 courses, I was stuffed and all I wanted to do was lay down hibernate and fall asleep thinking about all the delicious things that were in my belly.5. I really, really want to keep this place a secret for the fear that it will become more popular than it is and take me another 3 months or longer to return. But, I just can't do that. As soon as I got into work the next day I gushed about what an amazing experience this was and how everyone and there mothers who enjoy good food must go. So yes, if you love food, come here. If you like your napkin folded and a sommelier to tell you how the current vintage of your wine pairs well with the earthy notes in your dish--try elsewhere. This place is for people who are nerdy about good food and know what good food is.6. If I could hire Chef David to cook for me at my future wedding I'd do so without any hesitation! I'd also be okay if he wanted to come to my house and cook for me several nights a week. Yes this may never happen but a girl can dream.7. We will definitely be back when we are lucky enough to be picked for the coveted seats. Thank you Chef David and your hard working team for giving us such an amazing experience!, 'I went in to the Lazy Bear experience with pretty high expectations, considering it is an underground restaurant with 5 stars on yelp that generally requires a couple months waiting period to secure a reservation. One of my passions is trying restaurants around the Bay area, and I am always excited for a new experience, but I admit that my excitement for lazy bear was accompanied by a hesitancy of a it must be too good to be true possibility. As soon as I entered the doors of the quaint location and was warmly greeted by staff, this hesitancy completely evaporated. There was a disarming and overwhelmingly charming nature to those involved in this project, which was conveyed in their willingness for guests to come in to the kitchen as and take time out of prep to share their story and learn about those attending their meal.  By the time we were seated at the communal tables with the other guests and food was about to be served, I was open to loving the experience even if I had to compromise on the quality of the food, which fortunately ended up not needing to be the case. I won go through each course of the meal, but will mention a few of the dishes to convey the style and emphasize the general brilliance of the food. The meal began with four courses of snacks. The first being a shot glass filled with a layer of bacon, some sweet concoction, homemade hot sauce, and topped with whipped egg (light, fluffy, eggy deliciousness). This was followed by a cured turbo tuna that had been preserved additionally in lime ash, then served with dabs of sauce and lime juice. Then simple but superb preparations of fresh, local asparagus w/ fried onions and smear, as well as tiny bay shrimp with aioili and lime.  These dishes were before we had even begun the actual menu, and I would have been completely satisfied with just getting these snacks repeated several more times in larger portions and call it a night. A couple other dishes on the menu included:- Dungeness crab with a roasted cauliflower puree and beef jerky. The depth of flavor and smokiness in the puree being perfectly balanced with the freshness of crab and saltiness of the jerky (probably my favorite dish of the night). - Gently poached steelhead served over miners lettuce, radish, grapefruit, with a smoked pork broth to be poured in before eating. This was the dish that I was most skeptical of when reading the menu... steelhead... pork broth... grapefruit?? I didn believe these ingredients could be incorporated with balance. But Chef David provided the exact proportion of flavors from each component to make a coherent and brilliant dish.  This meal ended up being a 10 course tasting menu for $65 per person. In my experience, a menu such as this would be at least twice the price in any Michelin restaurant (and this menu could be served in any Michelin restaurant), and the majority of the time would not have the consistency of delivering such unique and flavorful dishes in each course.  In conversation with Chef David, he shared that he decided to start this project after transitioning from his career as a lawyer in 2009. If I had not known this going in to the meal, I would expect that he had classical training in the best kitchens prior to embarking on this endeavor to promote local, fresh ingredients, in a creative and exciting manner. There are strokes of genius in Chef David cooking, characteristics that I have rarely seen in the spectrum of restaurants on the Michelin, Zagat, or other prestigious restaurant lists. His willingness to receive feedback, and the effort he puts in to each meal and dish will allow him to continue to refine his skills and develop as a chef in the coming years. And I have every intention of eating at Lazy Bear as often as he will accept me so I can observe this progression.', 'I had never heard of this place except from my fellow yelpers but the amazing pictures encouraged me to sign up for the mailing list right away. After three months of rejection, I was in for the March 2 dinner! The chef always makes different dishes which keeps it exciting. For the curious, he posts a tentatively menu on his website. This was such a fun dining experience. If you ever wanted to feel like a judge on Top Chef, this meal will make you feel like one because the chef comes out for every course to explain what he made and any back stories about the ingredients. After the meal he came out to talk to us some more about our favorites and asked for any improvements he could make.The set up was really nice with candles and fresh flowers on two long communal tables. It is BYOB with no extra charges but they provide water. Almost everyone brought wine bottles and beers. I not a drinker but I slowly regretted not bringing my liter of Mountain Dew that sat in my fridge. :P The evening started out with some delicious small bites he called snacks:Scrambled Eggs with Maple Syrup and Smoked Hot Sauce - Not spicy at all! It was like a sweet and smoky egg foam. Really good!Cured Fish and Jalapeno - Tasted like sheared sashimi, okay.Grass Shrimp with Aioli - So good! You ate the fried shrimps whole, shell and all. It was one of my favorites of the night. Chef said grass shrimp don come by often and he had to buy some for our dinners that weekend. Then it was onto the main dishes of the night:Dungeness Crab with Cauliflower, Beef Jerky, Sumac and Brown Butter - Who knew jerky and crab would go together? The tender crab was swimming in brown butter. The jerky was crisp and added a great contrast to the softness. This was another favorite of the night and one of the best dishes Ie EVER had!Steelhead Trout with Miner Lettuce and Green Garlic Broth - This was a clean, pretty and healthy dish after that crab. The miner lettuce looked like lotus leaves in a pond of broth. Beautiful!Parsnip with Egg Yolk, Birch Syrup, Garlic and Parsnip Cocoa - I don have a problem with veggie dishes but this needed something else. It was like a plain mash and I wanted more flavor. I agree with another diner saying maybe some onion would have broken up the mushiness.Rabbit with Savoy Cabbage, Spaetzle, Prunes and Mustard Seeds - I would have liked more sauce because the rabbit got a little dry. I liked the spaetzles a lot! Theye twists of dumpling like pasta. So yummy, I like to make some at home!Finishing off with dessert: Pecan with Bourbon Ice Cream, Banana and Apple Caramel - Another texture problem with the mushiness that was spread on the plate. It seemed like he mixed the pecans, bananas and caramel together to make the spread that sat under the bananas and cake. The ingredients alone were good on its own. Treats - pb & jelly square, margarine, and cookie dough square Despite some hits and misses, I was so excited to hear that theye trying to open up a permanent space. Not everything worked but it was so refreshing to see such interesting ingredients come together on a plate and that there is a chef who is so willing to interact with his diners and take suggests to heart. I hope Il have the pleasure to eat his food again in pop up or restaurant form!', 'This is an awesome restaurant as it dishes out classy food in a casual setting. Wander into the kitchen (but not invited) and find the madmen at work! The service makes you feel very comfortable and are very attentive. Call ahead to make reservations. Their menu changes each month so be ready to be pleasantly surprised!', 'Chef David is amazing and listening him describe every course is pure delight. His love of food/cooking/etc makes eating his food all the more enjoyable. The experience is amazing...communal dining, touring the kitchen, perfect portion size and unique/creative food makes for the perfect night!I could not ask for a better meal and I can not wait for my next opportunity to eat at Lazy Bear or hire Chef David for a private event! And hopefully, Chef David will have a full restaurant soon so that I can be regular :)', What a fun and unique experience. A couple we know was chosen to go in the lottery and we were lucky enough to be asked to accompany them. We went on April 8. What a fun experience!! First off, since its BYOB, we went to a wine shop, and showed the professional wine guy the menu and he had some great recommendations. We brought a bottle of white, a bottle of light red, and a bottle of champagne to go with desert. The other couple brought a bottle of red and a bottle of port that they had been saving.The meal was absolutely delicious, lots of fun surprises and the chef would come out and talk to us about the food in between courses. It's a very intimate eating experience. I can't even begin to explain all the courses, I think they usually post all pics on yelp. Worth every penny! ended up paying $105 with tip. We will definitely enter the lottery for the next dinner they do., 'Last night, I just had the best dinner experience I have ever had. The food was out-of-this-world-incredibly delicious and creative (sous vide whipped scrambled eggs with maple syrup and hot sauce!?), the atmosphere was awesome (inside this funky art gallery), and we could go back into the kitchen to talk to the people making it all happen whenever, which was really great when we did shots of bourbon with everyone. I loved listening to David talk about each course and I really liked the relaxed/casual vibe of the meal. Such deliciousness without pretension.', As wonderful as all the other reviewers say. I was lucky enough to be chosen the first time around for Chef David's dinner this past weekend on 4/21, and it was awesome. Details below:The Food: Overall incredible. Extremely creative both in flavor and plating.- Whipped scrambled eggs infused with bacon and maple syrup: I will probably be dreaming of this for the rest of my life, especially when drunk and hungover.- Pea shell consomme: Interesting and creative, though not my favorite.- Fried oysters with fava beans, green apple and oyster cream: I actually normally hate oysters, but loved this dish. - Rockfish with strawberry gazpacho and avocado puree: another gem.- Foie terrine with maple gelee, roasted carrots, granola and spiced yogurt: The fluffiest, lightest foie gras I've had. The granola and yogurt sounds weird, but were great.- Pork belly, radish, grape fruit and honey: Perfect crispy skin and juicy meat.- Duck with duck sausage, peas, grits, chile and mint: I was getting ridiculously full at this point, but wished I were a cow with multiple stomachs because this was also deeelicious.- Cheesecake with rhubarb compote and lemon-basil ice cream: Fresh cheesecake is awesome, and the ice cream was really interesting- Desesrt platter: Honey meringue, sous-vide cookie dough and something else I can't remember (BYOB can be dangerous...)The Chef: David himself is really just a pleasure, and introduces each course with an enthusiastic overview. The location: Different each time, but likely a random hipstery warehouse / loft in the Mission., Secret Restaurant? Undisclosed location? A waitlist for months?You know what this means. *puts on Harry Potter invisibility cloak*I'm on assignment to investigate this btch.I cannot divulge the details on how I found the exclusive underground restaurant that goes by Lazy Bear, but I did. And like a thief in the nite, your modern day Hattori Hanzo ninja in female form, snatched bite after bite of carefully crafted edibles that were both art and tummy teasing glory. Fools! Do you not see disappearing food from your plates and your wine bottles empty?Next time, just for kicks - I may try to get in as mortals do. One said it took 3 attempts to finally be chosen in the lottery based reservation system.Next time, just for shits and giggles - I may just bring 1 bottle of wine at this BYOB dinner, because 2 seemed to blur memories of the last couple of platings of a girl about my sizeNext time, just for the halibut - I'll make sure all dietary restrictions are noted for my party - and by that I mean, we restrict diets And next time, just to throw caution to the wind, I may have everyone do the connecting arm wave or play Heads Up Seven Up because what else are 2 long communal tables of strangers meant for but to enjoy newfound company?, This ranks as one of THE best, most memorable, culinary experiences we've ever had the pleasure of enjoying.Amazing food, great setting, unique chance to interact with the chef and his helpers. And you can bring your own wine!Just get on their mailing list already!, 'Hipsters? Ummyyyyyyyeahno. Nope, not when I went.Matter of fact, I wish a hipster WOULD show up.So I was glad I hadn actually brought PBR for BYOB.Because everyone else had wine, and plenty of it.David Barzelay (anagram: Lazy Bear) narrates.Items are arranged before you to match his briefing.On your left is..., Underneath that is..., etc.The suggested eating order is the order he says it.$90 + tip (20% is $18) = $108, or $110 sans change.MENU: It changes for each event.yelp.com/user_local_phot43_SNACKS: egg whip, fish(?), cracker, bread & butter.yelp.com/user_local_phot43_OYSTERS: Point Reyes.

From start to finish, it was all so perfect. Definitely worth the many heartbreaks over not getting a coveted reservation! Shamelessly, I wrote out each course during the dinner.

It reminded me of something my mom cooks called Kare-kare, except instead of peanut sauce, it was a gumbo-type rue sauce. I scraped my plate cleannnn. Can I also mention that the snap peas were soo unusually fresh and sweet?? Best snap peas Ie ever had in my life. It weird bragging about snap peas, but they were mind-blowing snap peas.

SO GOOD. I could eat that whipped egg stuff everyday. Mmm, I salivating thinking about it!! Every dinner served at Lazy Bear always has a different menu. Two of the menu items that are constants are the whipped egg (YESSS) and the sous vide chocolate chip cookie. Chef came out and interacted with everyone. You could go into the kitchen at any time and take a look around. BYOB...but they provide water haha which I didn know. The only one there with a huge water bottle.Great experience! Would love to go again! =)', 'Soft shell crab is really good, yum !', Lazy Bear is one of my favorite restaurant experiences in SF! David the head chef is highly organized and has an excellent sense of putting together tastes and textures. I've gone to his dinners a handful of times and am always impressed. It's also a lot of fun - super perfect if you have out of town guests and you want to show them an intimate side to SF! Get on the twitter announcement list so you can try to get a seat, it's well worth it!, 'I wish there were six stars to give. The quality of the ingredience, the artisanal preparation, the balance of flavors plus the ambience... puts Lazy Bear one of the best in fine dining.', Definitely a splurge. Definitely one of the best meals of my life. Ended up being closer to 12 courses with the 'snacks.' It was perfect. 3 plus hours of dining. Hint: Bring your own wine. They give you 1 glass, so if you're having multiple different types of wine, feel free to bring extras, 'charming. well timed.exciting.almost perfect.really? brilliant. cheers, mr barzelay.', 'My boyfriend and I got lucky on our first try with a reservation due to a cancellation! I mentioned my dinner reservation in my uber ride and even she was envious! On the outside, Lazy Bear has got it all right (experience & food). It trendy, mysterious, exciting and has a very deserving 5 star rating.The restaurant has a very eerie cool feel to it. I felt like David Barzelay (whom we decided reminded us of Seth Rogan) just invited me to eat at his own house. We were a bit late but didn miss a single course. The others had started on the first snack as we walked in however as soon as we sat down, Mr. Barzelay himself came out with the whipped egg snack and gave us his spiel. (so cool~~)It doesn have the same thick pretentious air that Gary Danko and others seem to share. Very casual with family-style seating. The group around us seemed closer to our parents age but they were nice and quite funny after a few bottles of wine (BYOB). (theme song of our table: Living in America~ haha) !Tip: Not good for a first date Last but not least, the food was so fresh and creative. I can stress that enough. Impeccably timed, I was satisfied after our 4 hour meal.My favorite snack was the chicken liver pate with this big slice of chewy, gooey bread.My favorite entree was the lettuce wrap with beef, puffed riced and others. (very asian fusion)My boyfriend favorite was the mussels with apples/cucumber/dill in chilled soup. My SF food adventure is quite complete. Foodie title now well-deserved.Thank you, Lazy Bear. (and Hisashi)', Under ground restaurant. Took us about 9 months to finally get picked. Was super excited. Every month is a different menu. This time the menu was $85 a person (not including tip and tax) It was worth every bite. Super friendly staff, the chef comes out and explains each item we are eating.Just the stuff he puts with the food seems odd, but goes really well together.Started off with 3 snacks:Some steam egg with bacon-light and great bacon flavor. I wanted more pleaseTuna and melon with some kind of sauce-very refreshingChicken Liver pate with bread-I was surprise how much I liked the chicken liver and the bread was so yummyEntrees:Lettuce wrap with beef, puffed riced, green and curry sauce-sooo goodThe mussels with apples, cucumber, dill, and sake chilled soup-soo good tooBlack cod with garlic chips, and SUPER FRESH YUMMY TOMATOS-I love, love love.Let me just say everything was pretty damn awesome.Goat with figs, fried chick peas, and eggplant puree-this I was super scared. I don't like anything gamey. I was surprised that it was tender, flavorful, and tasted like pork. For dessert:Carrot ice cream with some cognac-this was a big thumbs down for me. I hate cognac so I wanted to barf.Green plums with some kind of green ice cream, candy apple almonds and some coffee flavor moose-this worked well together. I wanted to lick the whole plate. Then they give more little treats that are bite size that were not bad. I will come again if I can get the reservations. Worth every penny and the experience was funThey only have water, so you can bring your own drinks with no extra charge. For dessert they do serve coffee or tea., The meal was absolutely delicious, lots of fun surprises and a fun and unique experience. A bit pricey but it's worth the experience.Try snacks like panna cotta with ham; had some whipped eggs. Very artsy fartsy dishes....We brought a bottle of white, a bottle of red, and drank is with dessert. The other couple brought a bottle of red and a bottle of port that they had been saving., Holy moly. This was easily the BEST meal I've ever had in my life. SOOOOO FREAKING GOOD!!! I got in on a last minute cancellation (sucks for the party that left, but yay for me!), and I was pretty stoked for the meal. I've been applying to get into Lazy Bear for at least 5 months, so it was nice to finally know I got a seat!The food was PHENOMENAL. Each dish, snack, or treat (snacks were served before the meal, treats after) was so carefully thought out by the chef; you could taste and FEEL his passion for cooking. I thought he was quite playful with his dishes. One of the dishes was Coppa with a grape/balsamic reduction sauce, and butternut squash and cooked grapes on the side. I thought this dish was a stand out. The cooked grapes were quite light, but still really juicy and delicate. And the SAUCE was just POW WHAM BOOM FLAVOR. It was cool experience grapes in two different ways on one plate.I really liked the service, too. It was casual, but upscale. The waitresses were nice and the cook was very friendly and eager to describe his dishes to us. The cool thing is that you're allowed to go into the kitchen whenever you want! You can even ask them questions and stuff. The not so cool thing- I went in at a bad moment where the chef was yelling at his wife. Yikes! He apologized, but I have to say, I felt pretty awkward standing there as he screamed at her for doing something wrong with the relish.Five stars easily. This meal was a MEAL. So much food, and so well thought out. Every dish was something new and interesting and delicious in its own way. My absolute favorite?? The bread snack we got before the main courses. That bread was singlehandedly the best bread I've ever had in my entire life. Imagine biting into a cloud of pure, unadulterated pleasure to the palette. It was almost like an otherworldly experience. I almost cried it was so good. Yes, I almost cried over BREAD. That's how GOOD IT WAS.The meal took about 3.5 hours in total and it was expensive (but underpriced, really, for the quality of food and service you get), so its not something that I would do often. I'm glad I experienced it, and hopefully I'll be back sometime in the future!!Funny fact: I noticed a trend in the parties that attended. There was a significant amount of savvy Asian girlfriends dragging their very complacent, hungry boyfriends XD, 'Oh Lazy Bear, you delightful hidden gem! My fiancd9 and I had the pleasure of getting a spot at one of the December dinners via our 4th round of the lottery. The secret venue had a cool hipster vibe, and the communal seating placed us with a fun group of people to enjoy our meal with. While the menu was largely a surprise (even the printed menu card upon our arrival is alluringly vague) it certainly did not disappoint. We enjoyed about 4 small bites, before moving into 3 formal courses and 2 desserts. The pacing and portions were perfect for a tasting menu - after the 3 hour plus meal, we left full, but not as nauseatingly stuffed as I have following similar meals. The dinners are entirely BYOB, and a bottle (or two) of wine, or some nice beer would pair perfectly. Throughout the entire meal, guests are welcome to come into the kitchen to observe and ask questions. The meal is largely served by volunteers, but Chef David comes out as each dish is presented to detail what you are enjoying. Everything comes to the table at the correct serving temperature. Lazy Bear takes a spot among the top chefs tasting menus I have enjoyed - it is definitely worth the wait, and the prices fall well below what similar dining experiences will cost - but it is guaranteed to be far more unique.', 'I didn quite dine here again. I was given the unique opportunity to help out behind the scenes and still try all the dishes on the menu. I was impressed with David cooking the first time I dined here but this time his menu really blew me out of the water.THE SNACKSWhipped maple eggs--I still love these! David serves these up for every mealDehydrated rutabaga chip sandwiches with Mt. Tam cheese- Super fragile and difficult to assemble but totally worth it in the end.Brioche and butter- I was tempted to run off with the butter container. One of the ladies at dinner grabbed the whole pat and ate it straight up. Yeah, it that good! This is always on the menu as well.Frog legs- Most people get freaked out by frog legs but it just tastes like delicious chicken wings.ENTREESChicken liver pate- My favorite dish of the night. The blood oranges are a fantastic touch.Razor clam- this was like thick, delicious clam chowder. The shells look really cool.Dungeness crab- This was the only entree dish that I thought was good and not mind blowing.Grilled parsnip with gingered rice and fried quail egg- I don remember the last time I thought rice tasted this good. That pretty amazing considering how much rice Ie eaten growing up in a traditional Chinese/Taiwanese family. The fried egg and parsnip were incredibly flavorful. I was very pleasantly surprised at how yummy this was.Beef short ribs with beef-fat roasted carrots- Very tender and juicy. The beef-fat on the carrot tasted just like melted bone marrow. Drool~Puff pastry with poached (sous vide?) pears and home made ice cream- Best dessert Ie had in a long time. David described this as trying to bring out the taste of butter without actually serving butter. Mission accomplished!THE TREATSSous vide chocolate chip cookie- These ones tasted better than I remembered. This is also on every dinner menu.Butterfinger- Very buttery and flakey. Much better than my childhood candy barMarshmallow kisses- super soft with fresh mochi-like consistency. Lazy Bear is definitely worth checking out and I more excited than ever for his new restaurant!', Finally got in at Lazy Bear for last night, 2/11. We decided to cancel our reservations at Acquerello for Valentines day and do Lazy Bear instead. While I've never been to Acquerello, it was the right decision. Everything was just wonderful. The food was sublime. The venue where it was held was a really neat hollowed out club or lounge. Lots of exposed brick, and the bathroom was wallpapered with real vinyl records. There were two long tables that each sat 14 people (mostly young professional couples), so we got to meet some lovely new people. Best part (besides the food) is that it's BYOB so you can bring whatever you want to drink without paying outrageous prices for a glass of wine like you would at a conventional restaurant. Worst part was that I suspect even though I asked for decaf, I was given regular coffee with my dessert so I spent allllll night staring at the ceiling.Menu: Starters:Whipped egg with maple and hotsauce--fabulous. Chef even offered to email my bf the recipe--what a sweetheart.Parsnip chip Sandwich with Mt. Tam cheese---one of my favorites all nightCarrot roasted in beef fat--everything should be roasted in beef fat!Homemade bread and butter--when I ran out of bread for the generous dollop of butter, I ate the butter straight. It was that goodRaw oyster with an orange jellee...this one was a miss for me. Not a fan of oceany briny flavors.Entrees: (yup. those ^^ were just appetizers!)Bay Scallops with a quail egg yolk, meyer lemon granita (omg!), and a Chartreuse shooter.---Hands down my favorite course. It was rich and refreshing at the same time.Steelhead trout, brandade, roe, potato and radish. ---Good. Didn't care for the roe, for the same reason as the oyster. Cauliflower prepared 4 ways, bone marrow, Vadouvan, romanesco, leek---RIch and delicious, slightly bitter from the crunchy bone marrow. Pigeon, mushrooms, celery, brandy.--I quite literally licked my plate clean. The celery put it over the top. Lamb strip sirloin and breast, Bergamot marmalade, charred olive, valdeon--Everything was perfectly cooked, but not sure all the flavors resonated with me.Dessert:S'mores--deconstructed with several different types and textures of marshmallow, flourless chocolate cake, toasted marshmallow ice cream, and homemade graham cracker--Delicious, cleaned my plate, of course. I will say, I got very excited when I saw smores on the menu, but I think I'd rather have the old fashioned campfire version. Treats:Cumquat stuffed with panna cotta, sous vide chocolate chip cookie, blood orange lollipop. --To be honest, I wish I had ended the night with the smores. Didn't care for any of these. Overall, INCREDIBLE meal, the entire experience was superb. Can't wait to get invited back for another dinner service! One last thing, the survey question is asking me for ambiance. I checked both casual and upscale, because it's both. You can come as you are, and there is absolutely nothing pretentious about it. Unlike Gary Danko, or La Folie..great restaurants, but so stuffy, and I'm usually the youngest diner by a few decades....Chef David comes out and describes every last dish, and he curses like a sailor while he does it. It's adorable---but yeah, just a completely different take on fine dining., 'go there. worth the price. id still go if they charged higher. every dish was awesome. i hope he opens a restaurant soon', I *finally* was able to get a reservation here after months of trying... and boy was it worth it. Believe the hype, this food is off the charts. It was definitely one of the top 5 meals I've ever had in my entire life. I loved how un-pretentious it was for such an amazing dining experience.Oh, and bonus points for playing killer tunes the entire time too., Oh my- some of these reviews are painfully long. So the long and short of it is you need to picked from a weekly lottery to dine here. Google lazy bear for the deets. You put your name in and voila- at some point you'll be magically picked. The setting will be some random space with communal tables. I was stoked about the communal table concept, but unfortunately ended up sitting with a lot of people who liked to keep to themselves- boring!!!.. The menu is inventive and interesting and I promise you will try many things you've never had before. The price is reasonable and its BYOB, which is another big plus. Bring more wine than you expect to drink because service is painfully slow. At least it was the night we were there. The meal took 4 hours and it was a loooong 4 hours. Its a fantastically interesting dining experience and I recommend it to all adventurous souls with no dietary restrictions (Vegan or have Celiacs disease- umm skip it). The best thing we had that night was frog's legs (truly amazing). Not everything works and a few of the entrees were difficult to eat, but overall its a creative interesting dining experience and worth checking out., Unique settings and crafty dishes. It's all about the food here. No nonsense. Appetizers are the highlights. You get both quantity and quality., Took about 4 application attempts over 3-4 months to finally secure a reservation for 2. I'll keep this short and sweet and not go into menu items since it changes with each event, and you will probably not have what I ate if you go: the experience COMPLETELY lived up to the hype and my anticipation. I'd definitely put this up there in my Top 3 with Gary Danko and Picasso as one of my favorite dining experiences. I can't wait to go again!, 'Amazing. 5 stars is inadequate for this restaurant. They deserve 5 stars and 5 moons.Yes, the menu was fresh and wildy imaginitive. True, the venue was mysterious, chic and unpretentious; but what left me satisfied, impressed and greedy for more was the palbablity of Lazy Bear passion. You could see/taste/hear/smell the passion during the course of the night... in the food, in Chef David open-kitchen approach and in the staff unbridled enthusiasm. Since the previous reviews already describe the lottery and dinner process, Il simply add to be prepared to eat, drink and be merry for no less than 3 hours (ours took 4). Enjoy.', Wow. I can't stop thinking about our meal here last night. Probably one of the top dining experiences I've had. The food was delicate, creative, fresh, innovative and most of all delicious. Worth the 4 month wait. Thank you Lazy Bear for a night to remember!, 'A unique culinary experience well worth the hype (and the $). The whole experience was personal, from its intimate location to the communal dining, to the chef coming out to explain every single dish. Treats and Snacks were divided into 5 additional courses of innovative culinary art. It will remain one of the most memorable dining experiences in SF for me (one that I hope to one day have the luck of repeating). I also really am looking forward to the Chef starting his own restaurant one day soon. If Michelin stars can be given for underground dining, Lazy Bear gets my vote.', Hate to say it, but it was a little over hyped for me. I went here a few months ago when he was experimenting brunch service. Perhaps it was because we went during a brunch service (which was a first for David B). I honestly felt for the standard price (~$95 pp), what we got served for brunch was a little lackluster for what we actually got. A lot of the dishes were good, but I felt some of the dishes were painfully trying too hard to be daring for the sake of being daring. For instance, the cereal contained some greens in it (forgot what they were), it was interesting, but I didn't like it too much. Chawanmushi was the one standout dish that was really good and was impressed by the execution. Lamb Reuben was good, but not outstanding and the hen & waffle was good, but I felt it wasn't enough. The other dishes was a bit forgettableI was told during the dinner that we would be 'extremely full' by the end of dinner. I was admittedly a little hungry and not full. Overall, I felt it wasn't great value for the money, but it was definitely a fun experience. I'm not going to knock David B for what he's doing here. I get what he's doing and I understand this was his first brunch service, I may give him another chance for dinner, And he knocks it out of the park with again with the vegetarian menu. Finally got to take the French Spouse to one of Chef David's adventures. As before his mix of high technique and simple ingredients is on trend and on point. I'm always worried when chefs that usually work with animal proteins go whole hog so to speak with an all vegetarian menu but Chef David proved he is as skilled at vegetarian dishes as he is with meat.The dishes reminded me of meals at Meadowood, Tickets in Barcelona and our own local Atelier Creen in terms of presentation and transforming simple ingredients like green onions while not losing the flavours that make the ingredients so damn good. The service also flowed better than before and there was real confidence to courses. I'm always wary of communal dining tables but we've always had delightful dining companions and this time we hit the jackpot with some really great folks. Most importantly the very picky pescatarian French Spouse loved everything. I can't wait till he gets a brick and mortar so I can eat his food every couple of week instead of a couple of times a year., After around 6 months of failure to get picked, my dreams came true. Came in almost worried about how much I expected the food to blow me away, and oh man did Chef David deliver. Literally one of - if not the - best dinners of my life. I wish I could have Chef David as a personal chef and make him make me mind-blowing food all the time! If you haven't gotten in yet, keep trying. It's well worth the wait, I promise., Just had one of the top meals of my life and there was not a single bite of meat.Yes, there was dairy, and yes it was primarily in the form of butter. But NO MEAT! While I am automatically biased because I myself am a vegetarian, I'm positive any omnivore would have been more than willing to drop $$$$$$$ on this meal.So if you're just for the first time reading about Lazy Bear, here's some advice. Get on the mailing list. NOW! That's the only way to find out about upcoming meals. Then patiently monitor your inbox until you get that email about the next fantastic epic round of dinners they will be hosting and APPLY! Reservations are handed out by a lottery system. Unfortunately if you've already been to a Lazy Bear dinner once, your chances of getting in decrease dramatically.We got way more food than we had bargained for. The actual menu had maybe 8 items, but there were three rounds of amuse bouche and an extra round of sweet treats at the end. With all that food (yes we HAD to finish every bite - too good to waste) on top of finishing the bottle of wine we brought for the two of us, we were basically rolling out the door by the end. Two happy veggie stuffed human bouncy ballsMy favorites from our vegetarian feast: - Brown butter brioche with house made butter. Not only the best slice of buttery bread I've ever had, but also some of the best butter I've ever tasted. Everyone received a 4:1 bread to butter ratio (it was A LOT OF BUTTER) and I think almost everyone at the table finished their butter. - Pureed artichoke soup with fried artichoke, sunchokes, and some sort of green aioli: who doesn't love a warm, creamy soup poured on top of some fried vegetables? This one was done exceptionally well. - Soft slow cooked egg with sweet peas and olive oil cracker: I am not a huge pea fan but these peas were so sweet and springy. Covered in the yolk of that perfect perfect perfect egg along with the crunchy cracker..mm mm mm - Ice cream made from house made vanilla milk skins, hazelnuts, sweet egg white emulsion, dehydrated angel food cake: amazing. Milk skin ice cream sounds disgusting but this stuff was GOOD. There were a lot of things on the plate I couldn't identify but they all tasted wonderful in my mouth.As if the meal wasn't perfect enough, the experience made it 10x's better. We got to walk around the kitchen and bother the chefs as much as we pleased. They were so friendly and chipper the entire time and it's no wonder why - they were working with Chef David who is probably one of the coolest chefs ever. He came out at the beginning of each course to explain what we were eating and hung out for a long time after the 4 hour meal had ended (YES FOUR HOURS OF ECSTASY). Only $90 for all of that? We are all unworthy., 'Artful, affordable, and worth the wait.', This is my favorite restaurant in SF. I've eaten here three times: 2 times via the lottery (Dinner and Brunch) and once via private dining (Dinner). Things I love about the whole experience:- Food is SUPER tasty, inventive, and really indulgent: sous-vide pork-belly fried to a crisp (to maximize the good stuff), milk infused with cereal candy to pour on top of homemade cereal and homemade marshmallows, shooters of whipped eggs infused with bacon with a little maple syrup and hot sauce... the list goes on!- You go home so full of delicious things it almost hurts! Most menus have 7-9 items, and that doesn't even include the snacks and treats at the beginning and end of the meal. - It's unpretentious (well, as unpretentious as fine dining can get). It's BYOB (meaning you can get tanked without judgement or markup), Chef David comes out and tells you about every dish, you can even go to the kitchen and watch the action, and the wait-staff aren't fussing on changing your silverware every five minutes because you keep the same silverware all meal long. Licking of silverware is encouraged :)- Price is right for what you get. I've been to many more-expensive meals that didn't match in quality or quantity. I'll end this review talking a little about the private dining we did with Lazy Bear last summer. My fiance organized a surprise birthday dinner for me along with about 25 of my favorite people. They helped us find a venue, suggested wine to go with the meal, etc. But my favorite part is how Chef David asked my fiance to come up with a list of all my favorite foods and he created a custom menu just for me!! Super cool!! He even tried it out on a dinner the week prior to my dinner to work out all the kinks. It was an amazingly personal experience, and I can't thank Chef David and my fiance enough for creating it. Attaching a photo of the personalized menu so you can see what David did with it. The info he got was: I love smoked salmon, corn, bacon, steak, strawberries. The result was the following for each respectively: a deconstructed smoked salmon blini, a delicious corn chowder with awesome hoe cakes on the side, the aforementioned sous-vide pork belly with some delicious peach and other stuff to cut the fattiness, a steak number with amazingly sweet tomatoes to accompany, and an amazing strawberry desert with all sorts of fun flavors that looked beautiful. Kudos, Lazy Bear! You guys kick ass!, It's an under ground restaurant. It's pretty much a lottery system so If you're lucky, you get picked. Chef David says none of the items are ever repeated.The food was delicious! The chef comes out between every course and gives you a brief explanation of what you're eating. You can wander into the kitchen whenever you please and ask questions. They serve you water but you'll have to bring your own beer, liquor, or whatever your drink of choice is. My dinner lasted a little over 4 hours with my favorite courses being the sweet fish flown in from Japan and the tomato dish served with black garlic sausage. The dinner was $95 per person not including tip., Well worth the wait. AMAZING food. Every bite of every single dish was delicious. It's hard to get a spot here but don't give up. Would give 6 stars if I could., '...too lazy...and full......to.....write..full...........review.worth...every.peny...favorites were the snacks, the elk, the fish from japan, the friendly staff, chef david who is awesome and the best host, the open atmosphere, the adventurous mood, the chocolate, the soup, the freakin salty butter on brioche, and the revolving menu.bye', 'I think at first, I would be sort of a loss for words for this place. I think it hard to know what to think, because I honestly have tried the past five time to win the lottery to get a reservation and have not succeeded. I pretty much almost gave up on this place and the past weekend only entered the lottery ... for kicks. I didn think I would get in.BUT THEN I DID.Holy cow. This place is amazeballs. I don think there are enough incredible descriptors in the English language to explain this place. Of course it no French Laundry, but the experience it provides is so totally unique, totally different, and completely awesome that it hard to not put this place right up there with some Michelin stars Ie had the privilege to dine at.First, it not a solid location ... but I have been told they have some bids! There could ... soon ... be a Lazy Bear restaurant, and hopefully the dining part will be a lot more open to the public and less lottery. However, I really do consider myself exceptionally lucky, because it looks as if only about 40-50 or so people get a chance to dine each night that Lazy Bear serves dinners.It a communal thing, and there aren any reserved seating, but our party was lucky to get the end of the table closest to the kitchen so we always have a view of what was going on in there. Not that it was difficult to get in, because the chef welcomes and even requests your presence in the kitchen at ANY time to ask questions, poke around (with your eyes only of course ...) and observe. I love the open atmosphere of this place, and this freedom which you seldom get at restaurants of this caliber because they either want to keep their pristine kitchen pristine, or keep your spying eyes out of their way.The chef explained each and every dish we had, thoroughly and with some humor and flair. The menu stated 6 or 7 courses, but we had something like 14/15! There are some amazing snacks to start and multiple treats at the end. I also loved the BYOB thing since it really allowed us to break loose and bring our own wines and beers for tasting, and mixed it up. The place was somewhat dimly lit, I guess that would be my only complaint if it can even be considered that. Every dish was spectacular, every dish was on par with something I may have paid $25-30 per dish for at least. The creativity was definitely present but so was the heartiness of the dish. It definitely did not take away from the point of a meal the way I felt Alinea did when there was TOO much molecular gastronomy going on. Overall, I have to say this was one of THE best experiences Ie had in a VERY long time and I would highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend this experience to anyone, especially those who are foodies, into Michelin starred experiences or just want to have an amazing time.I recommend a party of 4, trust me it NOT a romantic date place but a fantastic place for gathering with friends!', 'It took 3 tries (months) to get finally get two spots. We arrived right on time at the secret location despite getting lost. (enter frowning face here) Our three and a half dinner started with multiple snacks and appetizers followed by 5 main courses, dessert, a shot of hot buttered rum (or was it brandy?) and more treats! The food was incredibly superb.The service rocked! They know how to take care of you. The chef comes out after EACH dish is served and explains the details of the dish! He also came out afterwards with his wife and asked the diners what we liked and didn like and why. They kept the water coming and despite it being BYOB, we were served water and coffee/tea at the end of our dinner.Wish he can open up his own restaurant soon!', 'Very very lucky me !!First try and got the reservation!. Simply amazing !!what is the less favor of the night ? I have no idea !! Maybe the restroom ?', 'Wow! I went to dinner on a Saturday night for the all snack menu and it was amazing. Definitely one of the most interesting and inventive dinners Ie ever had. This restaurant is underground so the location changes and you have to join the mailing list at lazybearsf.com in order to get a reservation. You pay in advance (tips included) and it BYOB. I was really impressed when I read Chef David bio and found that he taught himself how to cook while he was in law school. I so glad he started Lazy Bear and didn become a lawyer! You can tell that he really passionate about cooking through the dishes he creates and it really inspirational. I feel like he should be on Top Chef because while I was eating dinner, I thought to myself, this must be what the food tastes like on Top Chef. He announces every dish that is brought out and you can go in the kitchen at any time during the meal. Service was very attentive and my glass was always full. After the meal, you can stay as long as you want and ask him questions. My favorite dish was the Brown Butter Brioche, House Cultured Butter! I can even begin to describe how delicious this was. The Sweet Corn Churro was the best churro I have ever eaten and Ie had plenty. I didn like the Mole Poblano Nutella that came with this dish however because I don like spicy desserts. The Squab, Blackberry, Nasturtium, Cured Giblets was a highlight for me as well. One of the less incredible but interesting dishes for me was the Cured Tuna, Ash, Pineapple. I didn like that ash was an ingredient because ash for me just made it taste like it was burnt. Ie also had uni before and didn like it so the Uni, Totopo, Popcorn wasn my favorite. I eat pretty much everything when it comes to food so I wouldn recommend Lazy Bear Snacks if you don like seafood because raw fish was an ingredient in many of the dishes. I finished everything on the menu except the Hops, Clementine, Rye because I don like hoppy beer, the Herb Tincture in House Amaretto, Black Tea because I prefer Green Tea to Black Tea, and the sauce in the Smokey and El Bandito because it was too spicy for me. Overall, I would highly recommend trying to get a Lazy Bear reservation if you can! It was a fun and unique dining experience that Il never forget.', 'Wow.Lazy bear... was one of the BEST dining experiences of my life.The reservation is impossible to get. Luckily, this week they sold tickets first come first serve, instead of the usual lottery system. We got on it REAL fast, and was able to make it there for a friend birthday.1. Interior: This underground restaurant is a pop up, and you do not know where it going to be until you get the reservation. This time it was inside this... random space that was kind of like a theater. It reminded me of the backstage of high school plays. Haha. Not the most glamorous location but that why it was cooler! There were two long communal tables, where we all got seated with other strangers. Very interesting vibe.2. Service: Although they have no formal staff, everyone who was working/volunteering was just super super friendly. They took our beers and chilled them in the fridge for us, they were very prompt with cleaning up when I spilled my beer (yes, I did), etc. Obviously it not a fancy restaurant where they bring you matching color napkins, cater to your dietary preferences by adding and substituting, etc. So there was no mind blowing service or anything but everyone was just so chill and happy and friendly.3. Crowd: Everyone was fairly young. Mid-20 to late-30 at most. So this young crowd with the casual ambiance, the vibe is pretty chill. A lot of people were on dates, and although this is not your typical romantic fine dining experience, I think itl be the perfect place to take your date! You can impress your date by taking her to this underground restaurant, and dine in an easy and less rigid atmosphere where you can be yourselves!4. The experience: The whole dinner took 4 hours. I thought people were exaggerating when they said that it a 4-hour dinner, but no, it really was. Dinner started at 7:30, we left around 11:15. Despite its long journey, we were never bored. Every time a dish comes out, Chef David would come out and announce the dish. With his detailed description, we could really appreciate the dishes even more.The dinner is priced at $115 per person. This does not sound cheap, but if you consider that this also includes the tax and gratuity, it really isn too bad. Also, it is BYOB so you don have to spend money on overpriced restaurant wines. Everyone brought their own wine, craft beers, champagne, etc.Another unique and AWESOME thing about this restaurant is that Chef David lets everyone come into the kitchen any time. In between meals we would walk into the kitchen, watch them make the dishes, and ask about the food. The chef seems to really care about you really EXPERIENCING the food, which is why he has this interesting system.5. Now... Food: The chef spoils us by starting us off with FOUR snacks before the actual first course. Those four snacks alone took an hour of the dinner.Anyway, the snacks were amazing, too. The best part of it was their homemade butter. I just licked the butter on its own because it was SO damn good. I begged Chef David to let me buy some but got rejected... haha.And of course, each course that followed after was just simply AMAZING. Spot prawn with shrimp sausage, albacore, grilled corn with crawfish, slow cooked egg with hen confit, duck cassoulet... And then the desserts, muscat grapes with candied celery, passionfruit sorbet with black sesame and cheesecake, and the little treats that completed the meal. Every bite was so exciting and there wasn a single course that we didn appreciate. We all basically licked off each plate. I was so full after like the second official course, but I did not care. Everything was so. delicious.I obviously can really recommend a dish because it different every time. But let me tell you, no dish at Lazy Bear will disappoint you. Sadly, you can really go to this restaurant if you have any dietary restrictions. They sometimes have vegetarian nights, but I assume that even harder to get a reservation for, so good luck.This is truly a place for foodies. No bulls*it here with pretty view or candle lights or waiters in tuxes or anything like that. But what they DO have is a fun staff, unique location/ambiance, THE BEST FOOD EVER, and the experience you can have anywhere else in this world. So just go (if you can get a reservation, of course), enjoy whatever Chef David puts in front of you without complaining about what you can/cannot eat, and enjoy the journey he takes you through.I really hope I can go back to this place sometime soon!!', Foodie Heaven. If you want a delicious meal with appealing presentation and a laid-back ambiance. It's also Bring-Your-Own-Booze...so that's pretty neat. We brought champagne and beers, and a lot of people bring multiple bottles of wine!Worth every penny. You're bound to be eating for 4 solid hours! Come with close friends or a really special date. It's a fun experience for everyone! Casual Dress gives you the comfort to unwind.Lazy Bear can't be beat. David is innovative, creative, and knows his stuff. Him and his staff bring nothing but passion, love and bold flavors, contributing to one amazing experience.|1
26|le-bernardin-new-york|If you want an uber-trendy NYC dining experience, this is not the place to go. If, however, you want to have the best meal of your life, come to Le Bernardin. I was there about two years ago, and I STILL catch myself day-dreaming about that meal. I am not kidding you. Of course, I wasn't paying, so I took the liberty of ordering the chef's tasting with the wine pairing. They take themselves so seriously, they didn't even ask me if there is anything I won't eat; they just brought out course after course..., I was here with a bunch of relatives and my parents and everyone was at least thirty years older...and so I just ate the food and tried not play with the utensils or do anything stupid. I don't know what was ordered and what I ate...but it was amazing seafood., 'Was taken out for my birthday dinner to Le Bernardin. We had the tasting menu and it was divine! Course after course of seafood perfection. Chef Eric Ripert was in the house and made several journeys from the kitchen into the dining room. I was in heaven... Be warned, the crowd tends to be older, business types, but do not let that deter you from this!', excellent striped bass, halibut.lobster appetizer well worth it.don't go for something safe here like the salmon, you want your money's worth.service is a bit stuffy - god forbid you don't order wine, they may ask you to leave.can't argue with the chocolate souffle.definitely come for business lunch/dinner., Maybe it's b/c I'm pregnant and everything tastes weird right now . . . everything was good, but not extraordinarily so. Two of my favorites were the Alaskan Wild Salmon and the Passion Fruit Creme dessert. The black bass was nice and crispy, but a bit bland. Prepare to spend at least $100 pp for dinner., 'i absolutely hate bad reviews especially ignorant or hateful ones. this is neither, and it kills me to give one star....but here it is: the food was lovely, but i have never been treated so ungraciously in my life by a front of the house staff as i was here. in fact, there was absolutely no reason (is there ever really in the service industry?) for several people to be so incredibly rude to us at all. it was even known that we were industry. i expect we were just here on a bad night, but the experience marred our last meal and our last night in NYC.', 'To be honest, it was a bit of a disappointment. I had the lobster first course and the black bass main course. The lobster was tasty enough, but the black bass was a major let down. It didn have any taste! What up with that??? For dessert, I had a pretty gosh darn good Milk Chocolate dessert, which was milk chocolate mousse and other delectable (tiny) goodies arranged decoratively on a pristinely simple (and obviously expensive in its simplicity) white square plate.The atmosphere was very hushed-voices fine dining. That fine, but the service was pretty snooty, too. Sheesh. What is it that Sartre said about French waiters? A waiter who is too much of a waiter? Well, that these waiters at this here French restaurant.', 'I only tried the lunch here so my review is based solely on that. Overall, the food is on par with some of the best seafood dishes Ie had but definitely not above and beyond. Yes, the prices they charge warrant that expectation. I ordered the fluke ceviche as an appetizer and it was excellent. The ceviches were arranged in four small dishes, each having a different sauce. The sauces ranged from simple to complex which I assumed was indicative of the amount of flavors used and not the mental acuity needed to assemble each dish. As such, the sauces varied in the level of opacity from left to right. None of the sauces tasted like a mismatch for the fluke, all were enjoyable. Although I was only able to snag a small piece of the Kanpachi appetizer from my friend, that small piece was very good. The main was the Wild Striped Bass with a shrimp, clam, and mussel bouillabaisse. Eh. It only tasted like a hunk of fish, although a very well prepared and cooked hunk of fish. What was I expecting? I don know but it certainly wasn that. Now the dessert...mmm, chocolate (for both of us). This was much, much, more enjoyable than my fish. Delectable. The service was not absolutely snooty but not overly warm either. I guess professional is the best word I can come up with. So, all though the appetizers and desserts were great they cannot by themselves warrant 5 stars (at least for lunch) for the restaurant. Hopefully I will get to try dinner here and see if the hunk of fish improves.', DISAPPOINTING!!!! Food was very average and if dinner is going to be over a hundred a person, it better be f*@&ing special. Decor is droll, especially for a place like NYC. Expensive wine poured in my bf's cocktail and overall amatuer service. HIGHLY UN-recommended., Consistenly epic. Every meal. I had a sea urchin dish here once about a million years ago that I still can't forget., Wondefully done. This was my second best dining experience in New York (after Per Se). The seafood, the preparation and the presentation were all superb. I really don't have a thing to complain. My friend thought our French sommelier was sorta snooty, but I found him knowledgable, charming and amusing -- especially with that special metal shot-glass-necklace-thing that he wore for wine tasting., 'As an admitted chef at heart and food lover, I had been anticipating the chance to finally get to Le Bernadin. It was delicious, with terrific service. After that 3rd Michelin star, my expectations were through the roof. I only give a 5 when something is PERFECT. And, my opinion is that Le Bernadin is fantastic, but it no Jean Georges. See my glowing review here, yelp.com/list_details?us43_ The food was delicious and well prepared but frankly, something was missing. The creative inspiration was just not there. What I love is when I know what the ingredients are in a dish, but that first bite makes me squeal with delight and surprise. I love it when the chef does something extraordinary that makes your mouth say Where have you been all my life??? I didn know I could taste something like this! That how much I love food. The flavors were terrific and the execution wonderful but the passion and inspiration were missing. Even in the Black Bass, prepared with masala spices in a ginger-cardamom broth. I read that and I thought the dish would knock my stockings off. It was delicate and delicious, but there was no flourish of brilliance. The same was true of my flash-pickled scallops with sea beans, cucumber and pink radishes and the braised chanterelle and porcini. My husband felt similarly about his meal. It was delicious but not worth a perfect score.The ambience is also a little bit cold and the service, while well executed, doesn draw you in and wrap you in an intimate glow. In hunting a 5-star rating, that what I expect. Jean George is my favorite, I still haven found a NY restaurant that can supplant it. But, Il keep trying. And Yelping along the way.', 'Previous Review said it all. Great but no Jean Georges. The food - sublime. The room - corporate. The service- very showy but attentive.The Tuna with Foie Gras and Oil was just devine. My standout dish here. Le Bernardin is is like the steady dependable spouse. Jean Georges is the exciting, vibrant lover. (The restaurant-not the person-please!) ;)', This place is ridiculously amazing!!! I had the highest expectations and they were exceeded at this NY Times 4 star, Michelin 3 star place. Those are high rewards and yes, it lived up to them. We had the chef tasting menu and every dish just got better and better. We had about 9 courses and the kobe beef and salmon really stand out for me. Bread was good, desserts were amazing and different and the service was just EXCEPTIONAL. This place is known for it's elegant service and hospitality. I was impressed and very wow-ed. For those who really know me, this is NOT my kind of dining (too fancy for me), but this is a nice thing to do once in awhile. Many people say this restaurant is their favorite in NYC. Now, I can see why..., This is a temple for exceptional fine French fare. At first, the portions feel petite, just go with the tasting menu, and you'll see why Zagats has such high ratings, and why it's hard to find a reservation. The service was impeccable, the patrons, were older, or older man, younger, beautiful women... =) still, it's fun to watch, to be treated so well, and to have this experience., It's Eric Ripert's flagship restaurant. go and eat there. duh., I've enjoyed dinners in some of the best restaurants in the world, but only a few of them can hold a candle to Le Bernardin. My wife and I splurged there for our 25th wedding anniversary - had the fixed price tasting paired with wines. The portions were small, but adequate; the sauces unbelievable; the wines, although not terribly interesting, went perfectly with each dish. God forbid that you go there without a suitcoat - they will loan you one - although there were plenty of gents with jeans and tennis shoes and sans ties. Very strange, really. They didn't seem to care what the ladies wore. I refused to wear my coat, and they asked me three times to put it on. I figured that, with a $575.00 bill on the way, they could survive my obstinance; but I was the only one., 'Ok it was some time ago now. It was a reciprocal arrangement I made with a friend who taken me to The Modern.It a little more formal than The Modern and has a little bit more of a feel of Grand Dining. My friend and I had one of the tasting menus and shared a bottle of great wine. Overall I enjoyed The Modern more but this could have been just my mood. It certainly isn a reflection on the food or service which is exceptional. Very hard to fault the food. Everything was excellently presented, inventive and very very tasty. Save up those quarters and splurge at the end of the year! It has to be done once.', 'Superlative. My girlfriend and I went for my birthday this year, and suffice it to say, we were thoroughly impressed and amazed at how impeccable every aspect of dinner turned out to be. Ie eaten at restaurants of similar calibre, but this certainly rises to the top of that distinguished and fantastic list. We had a great table with a view of the entire restaurant, which is beautifully decorated with just the right level of elegance, modern flair and understatement. Daniel is beautiful in its own right with its amazingly ornate and classical decoration, but I much prefer the atmosphere at Le Bernardin. The warm lighting, comfortable seats and fantastic atmosphere get you in the mood to indulge in an amazing meal. Further, the service was absolutely perfect. None of that French looking-down-our-noses-at-you haughtiness that can plague other restaurants like this. The servers, sommeliers and maitre were not only knowledgeable and helpful, but unusually friendly. They made the entire experience that much more fun and memorable - our sommelier joked with us throughout the night as we drank the wine that he and my girlfriend (the wine expert of the two of us) ultimately decided upon. It ended up being a great complement to our meal.Now, on to our meal...we decided to splurge and have the Chef Tasting Menu, and honestly, I have to say, that if you go and you can afford to take the plunge, do so confident that you will be getting your money worth. The courses we enjoyed were conch in jalepeno and lemon sauce, sea urchin and caviar ravioli in a rich butter sauce, perfectly prepared halibut in lemongrass broth, salmon in a split pea and bacon sauce, a combination white tuna and kobe beef in brown butter sauce, and lobster in a lemon butter sauce. Each course was dutifully brought out and set at the table with a flourish, followed by the sauce being carefully poured on accompanying a brief description of the dish by our waiter as the savory aromas from the sauces wafted our way. Literally, each and every one of the dishes was the single finest execution of that dish I have ever experienced - hands down. Ie never had better conch, ravioli, halibut, salmon, tuna, beef or lobster. Usually when you go to these places, one or two of the courses are knockouts, with the others being great, but not as good as the highlights. Here, each and every dish could have been the highlight at any other restaurant, but here they were, one after another on one tasting menu.This gustatory orgy was followed by a pre-dessert (first one Ie ever had...) of a white chocolate mouse, caramel and sea salt mixture inside of a I don know how they did that hollowed out egg shell which we ate with tiny spoons. Wow. Next came the real desert, a combination chocolate and hazelnut ganache and bar with creme fraice ice cream. Second Wow. The texture was unreal. Then, since it was my birthday (which my girlfriend had told them 1 month in advance when she made the reservation and hadn had to remind them about...!) they brought out a passion fruit crumble and ice cream infused with passion fruit and white chocolate, with Happy Birthday written in delicate chocolate syrum calligraphy along the bottom of the plate. Third Wow. All in all, a dining experience like none other Ie had in my life. Something people inside and outside New York should get to enjoy if they are ever presented with the opportunity. It is refreshing to know Old-school quality and tradition married with New-School style can exist and be executed to such an impressively perfect degree, and it right here in Manhattan!', 'I must be buggin to be giving this rest. only 3 stars since its 1 of the city top restaurants but I really didnt have a great experience here. Our reservation was for 4 people and I shoulde known the night was going to be bad since 1 of us did not know a jacket was required and was pretty much accosted at the door before even stepping in asking him what he was doing there, etc. I don know if it was his southern accent that threw them off or what but they were really rude but luckily they had a spare jacket for instances such as this. Since we all like to pick and choose, we all decided to order ala carte which is a prix fixe of $107. Almost Raw: I started off w/ the Seared and Marinated Yellow Fin Tuna Sandwich; Ginger, Lime and Olives - heaven, I can think of anything else to describe it, prob the best part of the meal for me.Barely Touched: Warm Peekytoe-Maryland Lump Crab Cake; Shaved Cauliflower; Dijon Mustard Emulsion - very tasty but I felt the Dijon mustard was a little too overpowering for meLightly Cooked: Baked Lobster; Wilted Romaine, Squash and Candied Ginger; Port and Tamarind Reduction - I just didn get this; I mean how could you go wrong w/ lobster? Maybe it me but I didn like the port and tamarind reduction at all, it completely threw off the entire taste of the dishDessert: Passion Fruit Cream Enrobed in White Chocolate, Ginger Caramel, Mandarin Sorbet - mmmmmmmmmm, deliciousSo the meal itself was not horrible, I think I may have just ordered the wrong thing. The thing I disliked about this place the most is the snooty service we got, especially from the sommelier who thought he was too good to engage in a little conversation about great wines, isn that his job? I guess my friend was already marked as a target since the no jacket incident but come on, we def. didn skimp on our meal and ordered A LOT of wine so I have no idea why they were giving such attitude. My other friend even ordered the Seared Japanese Kobe Beef; Truffled Herb Salad (8 Ounces) which was upon request for a $150 supplement, which turned out to be about $257! I thought that was just crazy, I mean I did taste the beef but it didn seem like it was worth $150, geez. So yea at the end of the night, w/ the 4 of us, the bill was about $1700 inc. tip and we still got the cold shoulder, o well, i glad i at least got to go', My boyfriend's parents took us to this place while they were in town. Really fantastic food, but I don't know about the bright lights there. It could be so much better if their lights were dinner to create more of a mood. Service was amazing, and the food looked like art. This was a totally different dining experience and I think my boyfriend and I were the youngest people here. If you want fine dining, this is definitely the place., 'While Ie had my fair share of fine dining experiences, I had never dined at a Michelin 3-star -- a one-star in Paris, which knocked my family socks off, yes, but never a 3-star, so I was incredibly excited for my show and late dinner in New York.Sadly, Le Bernardin just missed living up to my hype. Of course the service was attentive and diligent, although our main server seemed to abandon us mid-way, probably because of our light drink tab (despite the fact that my boyfriend and I both don drink, I might have opted for some bottled water, except that the bf doesn like sparkling water, and neither of us likes Evian or Fiji). Luckily, the food runners were more than capable, and indeed they all seemed authentically French -- I can help but wonder that the restaurant runs a food service personnel smuggling ring on the side?Le Bernardin offers a prix fixe menu with a choice of four courses, or two tasting menus. Usually my family and I like to get the tasting menus when eating at a nice restaurant, but given that you must order the tasting menu for the whole table, that the tasting menu is something like 6 or 8 courses, and that most of the dishes on the tasting menu are available a la carte from the prix fixe... well, it just seemed to make more sense to choose only the dishes we really wanted and order from the prix fixe. The server didn seem to push the tasting menus either -- I had to ask about them -- which seemed a little odd to me. Aren tasting menus usually the piece de resistance for gourmet chefs?In any case, the food overall was well-executed, as it must be to get any recognition, but not mind-blowing. My boyfriend had the foie gras and yellowfin tuna appetizer which he found a little too salty, but I really enjoyed the complexity of its flavors, and the combination of the creamy foie gras with the denser texture of the tuna and crunchy baguette. I also enjoyed my bacalao cod salad, but it wasn wow-worthy. Likewise, the crab cake, salmon, and black bass were well-executed but just not amazing (and can someone please do a salmon that doesn involve wasabi and/or peas please?). While there a place for good but not amazing food, come on -- when youe paying as much as you are, in as fancy a restaurant as you are, with as much trouble getting reservations as you had, and with as many Michelin stars behind it as this restaurant does -- you want it to be AMAZING if not amazing. It seems like a good place for a fancy business meal, or a random night out for the financially blessed, but I save the dreams of a gastronomic white knight sweeping you off your feet for somewhere else.', 'This four-star restaurant serves top notch seafood. The freshest seafood is prepared using simple techniques to highlight the fish best qualities. Broken down into Almost Raw, Barely Touched and Lightly Cooked the menu reflects the preparations of the fish. I had off of the Almost Raw menu, KUMAMOTO~Marinated Kumamoto Oysters in Shiso-Lemon Extra Virgin Olive Oil, TUNA ~Seared and Marinated Yellow Fin Tuna Sandwich; Ginger, Lime and Olives. Off of the Barely Touched menu, I had the LANGOUSTINE~Spicy Langoustine Sambal; Chayote and Pear Julienne and off the Lightly Cooked, I had SURF AND TURF~White Tuna and Seared Japanese Kobe Beef Korean BBQ Style; Fresh Kimchi; Lemon Brown Butter Emulsion. I simply thought I had died and gone to food paradise.', 'Ahh, my meal here several years ago marked my entry to foodie-obsessiveness. I had the chef tasting menu, which consisted of way too many courses to possibly remember (besides this really interesting tuna-carpaccio w/ fried foie gras thing).Service was impeccable. I arrived before my dinner partner and they seated me on squashy chairs with complimentary appetizer pretzel-things. I remember vividly that this is the first time I noticed a sommelier wearing the wine-tasting dish on a chain around his neck. After discussing the possibility of his being a Flava Flav fan, I finally mustered up the courage to ask the stiff server what it was all about. He smiled kindly and replied Yes, he in trouble. That his punishment, and left us to wonder for a few seconds before he told us the truth. Looking back, I very impressed they didn just laugh in our faces, or make us feel stupid somehow.The missing star is due to the lack of a particular dish I REALLY enjoyed. Everything was delicious, but nothing really stood out to me.', 'I exhausted.After 3 days of pushing my body beyond human endurance, I spent. I manage to utter a few final words to wifey before I give into my utter fatigue. Honey, go on without me... Il always remember the turbot.We have been on a mission... nay, a quest. We made a solemn pledge to each other to either finish what we started, or suffer eternal humiliation and financial ruin if we stopped.I not letting you quit! Wifey had a steely look in her eye, but even I could tell that her resolve was beginning to falter.I know youe hurting, I know youe scared, I am too! But we can stop now... not after all that wee been through! She gently caressed my hand and gave me a few sips from the faded Perrier bottle she was carrying.I knew she was right. I couldn stop now, not after everything Ie invested...Slowly, I pushed myself up from the filthy Manhattan sidewalk and brushed off the detritus and debris of 51st Street. My ego had taken a serious hit, but I still had my pride. With wifey at my side, I knew we had a good chance of completing this journey.______________________________________________Coroner note: The above entry is thought to have occurred sometime in the middle of July 2007. The subjects were known to be a married couple from California. The quest which is referred to several times in the journal was later elucidated to be a pursuit to dine at every three-star rated Michelin Guide restaurant in the United States. Scattered remnants from the scene indicate that the couple came to NY from The French Laundry in Napa, California and had just dined at Per Se approximately two nights prior to the above journal entry.Our forensic experts have also determined that the above journal entry occurred just after a rich meal at the famed New York institution, Le Bernardin. The male subject may have been suffering a stroke or merely severe indigestion after what appears to be several days of culinary overindulgence. The five-star rating evidences that their experience at Le Bernardin was favorable. Undigested food particles were analyzed and reveal an abundance of seafood including the aforementioned turbot. Gas chromatograph and NMR spectroscopy reveal that the seafood in question was of the highest quality and perfectly prepared.It is unclear if the couple singular experience at Le Bernardin was the cause of their demise or rather a culmination of experiences during their quest.Researchers are in the process of determining their whereabouts. No bodies have yet been recovered.', Absolutely delicious and absolutely decadent. There's a $64 prix fixe, but I unfortunately had to miss dessert because a 2 hour lunch was just too much for me... You start with some toasted bread with a lobster salad spread, then comes the actual rolls (your pick of an assortment from the basket) that will keep coming until you tell the waiter to stop (really you need to be clear you don't want anymore). I had the conch appetizer, which was perfectly unchewy; and then I had the striped bass main course - also delicious. All of the main courses have sauces that get poured out separately. My fish was again, very perfect in tenderness - no problem using the ever elusive fish knife.It's a beautiful space and you feel as rich as the cost of your meal. Love that the decor is not overwhelming French, but modern without being weird. Everyone's main course came with its own sauce which the waiter pours for you, Le Bernardin deserves its gazillion-point Zagat rating for many reasons, but I'm giving it 5 stars here for one highlight of my dining experience: I was pleasantly surprised to find that each stall in the women's bathroom was stocked with feminine hygiene products. In a city that thinks that chicks will steal tampons with the same zeal with which they apparently steal toilet paper, Le Bernardin is a pioneer in the field of women's rights.The food wasn't bad either. Tuna tartare, spicy black bass, chocolate corn served three ways . . . each dish was beautifully prepared and fantastically plated. My dining partner had a monkfish entree with truffle sauce that was to die for -- I seriously considered stabbing him in the neck with one of my many silverware options and comandeering his meal. Fortunately for him, Le Bernardin's decor has a soothing effect, and by the time I was midway through my entree I was too satisfied to do anything but bask in the glory that is this restaurant.I see that the service has recieved mixed reviews, but my experience with the many servers with whom we interacted was nothing but superior. We got this great table in the back of the restaurant where we could scope out the other diners, all of whom looked like big wigs in their respective industries, but the servers still treated us like VIPs even though we were obviously young and possibly disfigured.Le Bernardin is a great restaurant with a great location and great food. Is it the best of the best? That's for you to decide, but on this one I agree with Zagat., Le Bernadin - Insane Zagat rating, three Michelin stars, known as the best seafood restaurant in the country, if not the world. And then, of course, there's all that gushing from Hung on Top Chef about Eric Rippert being God's gift to seafood...I expected quite frankly, the most exquisite seafood meal I've ever had. Indeed, our meal was good. But it was not memorable. Le Bernadin didn't differentiate itself from other high end dining. I left wondering what all the fuss was about., We went to Le Bernardin the last week of September when the UN meetings were taking place so I think we were in the company of political figures though I didn't recognize any. The clientele seemed older and we were one of the younger patrons there. Overall I thought the food was top notch, very well done and presented, but I was not blown away as far as creativity. My husband and I enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu which costs $180 per person. We had marinated Fluke, warm Lobster timbale, Calamari, sauteed & filled with sweet prawns, barely cooked wild Alaskan Salmon, didn't have the Turbot available but we had another fish instead, Escolar - a white tuna poached in extra virgin olive oil, Butternut Squash puree, ending with Chocolate dessert cream and caramel. My favorite dishes were the fluke and lobster and least favorite was the dessert. The room was very nice but not romantic as it seemed a bit noisy. The service was serious but outstanding and unparallelled. If we needed anything at all and barely began raising a hand or finger, one of the many waiters immediately came over. I felt like the staff always had their eye on us, in a good way. I enjoyed my meal here, but the ambience didn't leave me wanting to come back any time soon. It would have been nice to get a few chocolates on the way out or something sweet to enjoy later as the dessert left me wanting something else. Oh, and a friend of ours who dined here a few years ago told us that his bill came with two lines for gratuity, one for the staff and one for the manager...ours did not., I don't know how anyone could review this place with less than 5 stars. My meal this last Saturday night was only topped, in my life, with the meal I had here a couple of years ago. Everything was absolutely fantastic and I'm quite the picky bastard. Our waiter was not quite as good as the one I had the previous time but that's small stuff. The sommelier was attentive and helpful with a ton of information and generally just a great attitude. The food - its the point of going here in the end, right? Just about everything blew me away and I was especially impressed with the pairings. Not that the pairings were bad last time but they seemed that much more fitting this time.The only dish I'll say wasn't 100% great was the desert which was a black sesame panna cotta. My girlfriend's favorite dessert is panna cotta but this one was a bit too thick and gelatiny but it was a minor hiccup. Because we're cheese freaks, we also asked for access to the cheese cart. Outside of the tasting menu, the waiter kind of went to town. We picked out 4 cheeses and he added a fifth one (Portugeuse) that was genius and some quince paste. An additional $20 appeared on the menu - are you kidding? I don't know that you'd get away with 5 french cheeses at Balthazar for $20.Our only dilemna now is how often we can go to this place because the cost is, well, appropriate. I just think this place makes all the right moves at all the right times. You CANNOT go wrong here. Just bear in mind that, with a wine pairing, and any sort of variation on the menu or pre-dinner drinks, etc., you're looking in the $300 - $350 range per person, when you factor in tip. Oh well, that's what makes this place special - you can't go here everyday. Check that, I can't go here every day., I had a gift certificate from Opentable.com, so I decided to blow it on a solo lunch at this dump. ;)Go here for lunch if you want to pamper yourself. The service is the friendliest I've encountered in my (extremely limited) fine dining experience, and the prix-fixe is only $64.Also, it's not the sexiest or trendiest of atmospheres, so I can imagine it might get a little stiff at night.The olive-oil poached escolar with black peppercorns brought a tear to my eye.If you love seafood, save your pennies and go!, 'No longer the same, sorry to say, this felt like a tourist trap.Tasting menu dinner $125 or $180I am drawn to glitter and appreciate fine tea, Le Bernardin has both.In the middle of the room there are sparkling cubes for the Holiday Season. The tea was extraordinary. I liked the quiet din of the dining room.Relative to other restaurants in its category the food merits 2 stars. Relative to some of the french bistros in the east village which carry similarly prepared fish, it merits 1 star. Service was average and largely uninspired. Food held a bit too uncomfortably close to waiters faces while they carried it - directly under their noses (some longer than others..).I am strong believer in NY attracting the brightest and the best and would not include this as an exceptional french/ only seafood dining experience. I agree with most of what Daniel M says in his review on 7/08/07- almost identical dishes and reactions. I would recommend for a business lunch or dinner or if you cannot get reservations at another restaurant in the same caliber but still want that french cache.Note: I recently found out when you make reservations for dinner, there is a time limit on your table. I believe it was two hours.', I went with my husband and another couple and had one of the best meals of my life. We all went for the tasting menu ($135 sans vin, $220 avec vin). If you're a wine drinker, you'll be happy with the generous pours - six servings total - with lots of interesting whites. The amuse bouche was a scallop, beautifully presented in a shell. We then went through stunningly plated and sauced servings of salmon, crab, halibut, skate, and monkfish. Dessert began with a black sesame panna cotta, followed by a chocolate creation, which looked like a Kit Kat but tasted approximately 1,000 times better.I was impressed with the service: cordial, not too snotty, and incredibly efficient. It was definitely a 5-star experience., 'This place is out of control... it the Wayne Gretzky of traditional restaurant experience. Always at the top of nearly every list, and for good reason. The review really should just be duh, it great and move on.But in the spirit of verbosity (which is a word I would only use in reviewing a restaurant as proper and haute as this) I think it fair to say there might not be a restaurant in the world that more impeccable in its service, presentation, and consistency. The food, duh. But the staff is almost creepy in their perfect timing and demeanor. I almost wanted to throw food around the room just to see how they come up with the proper way to handle it.', Great restaurant (Top 10 on my All-Time) with spectacular service and sublime food. Oysters were in my top of all time, just below San Francisco's Hog Island's. Hamachi was perfectly cooked with a warm, subtle hint of saffron oil. Distinct and slightly fruity tuna was accompanied by crisp, pan-friend Kobe, drenched in butter. SInful, but worth it.Dishes:Kumamoto Oysters (Wow!)Hamachi (Perfect)Surf and Turf (White Tuna and Kobe Beef) (Stunning!)Kanpachi (Good)Bacalao (Very good)Black Bass (Very good), 'I have only eaten at two other restaurants in my life that have given me such a perfect dining experience. Plaza Athne restaurant, Alain Ducasse and the French laundry when Thomas Keller was in the kitchen. The best fish across the board that I have ever had. I spent weeks dreaming of my dining experience at Le Bernardin. One of the best food memories of my life.', 'Wonderful seafood! Great sauces. Indulgent desserts. Wonderful sommelier. For a more economical affair, I recommend the lunch menu or the 3-course City Menu at $40.', Sometimes, I think life is unfair because I was born as a Vietman war refugee and my parent's meager earnings from sharecropping wasn't enough for me to acquire this palate early on. I can only imagine what my life would be like if say... I was like Paris or an heiress to Bvlgari but then and again, when I think about my culinary adventures and the deep appreciation I have for these meals I realize I am quite alite!For my 22nd birthday (again) I was given a choice between Chef Daniel Boulud's restaurant or Le Bernardin I choose the obvious because I was quite impressed to learn Chef Eric Ripert tends to kitchen everyday. How many three Michelin star restaurants can say that? None. - I think. Le Bernardin is unassuming for their fame and glamour. The service was meticulous and professional. The meal was captivating., I tried the Chef's Tasting menu and wine pairing tonight and was sorely disappointed. A majority of the flavors I encountered were something similar to an Asian fusion rather than an exquisite French restaurant. The key disappointments to the evening were 1) A white fish that was smothered in a miso/soy sauce and 2) A calamari dish that tasted seriously like a vegetarian dumpling. The white fish wasn't actually bad, it's just that well I'm Asian and my aunt can make a better white fish with soy sauce dish. It also wouldn't cost me an arm. The calamari-vegetarian dumpling thing also would've been fine if I was in a restaurant in china town. Once again, china town does not cost my other arm. There was an asian fusion dish that I think was first. A cerviche style halibut maybe? It was a white fish dish that was demolished of its delicacy by an over use of salt and orange citrus juices. It was almost good. That all said, the highlights of the tasting were 1) a tasting of a scallop in an amazing pink sauce that was served first and got our hopes up, 2) the Wild Salmon which simply melted in your mouth and 3) the White Tuna that just tasted amazing since it was served right after the aforementioned whitefish and soy sauce thing. The White Tuna also had a thicker sauce which I believe allowed the sauce to more tastefully applied to the fish rather than doused in it. Did I mention that? At least 3 of the dishes had their seafood just swimming in an overpowering sauce. I'm really hoping there was guest chef there tonight or maybe they were trying some new dishes because I simply don't see why anyone would visit this place for their tasting menu. Also, the wine pairings were close but still off. I wish I had a better memory to spew out the exact pairings. All I can say is that save for think the first pairing with the cerviche thingy and the pairing with the white tuna, the wine pairings were either too overpowering or just didn't add any complimentary flavors to the dish. It was great to taste each wine on its own at first, but disappointing when the wine had ruin my palette for dish it was suppose to compliment. I might try the place again to just get ala carte or the regular pre-fixe. The tastings is out of the question., 'Went in Nov 2007. Somewhat poor service b/c multiple people asked us if we wanted wine including the sommelier and waiter. Seemed a bit rushed for such a popular restaurant. Food was a bit plain. Got the skate wing (of course), which was only sprinkled with paprika.', Very good, but Eric Ripert seems to have gone too far off the Asian deep end. He's lost touch with his French roots. I would much rather eat really good Asian food than this neither-nor.Now that said, the service is without peer, the venue is gorgeous, and the wine pairings were easily the best I've ever experienced. Each wine was great in and of itself, and they were perfectly matched to the following course., After taxes I net about $5000 a year....but I will drop hard earned cash on this spot any day! This is the best food I have ever eaten...hands down. For a while this was the only place I'd take my significantly better half for her birthday. All their fish entrees are just sooo light..and I mean that in a good way...yet by the end of the evening I'd be so full! People may whine that it's too expensive, small portions..blah blah blah...but I've always believed you gotta pay to play. In this case you gotta pay to get incredible food. If you go be sure to get the tasting menu...I mean if you're in there you may as well go for broke (in every sense of the word)., Is it redundant to give Le Bernardine 5 stars? Maybe, but still worth doing. Went last night, and even though I had nightmares about the $200 per person bill, it was money well spent. The staff is supremely attentive, the food is marvelous, and the wine selection is amazing. I had the almost raw diver scallops, then the peek toe crab cake with shaved cauliflower, and finally the cod (this last one, the sauce was a bit salty but still very good). For dessert, a lemon concoction that was heavenly. The portions are small, so don't come starving. Come with the mind set that you will be spending $200, and simply enjoy!, In a city full of restaurants that come and go and see good times and bad times, Le Bernardin is an institution, and rightly so. I would rate my experience as one of the most flawless and perfectly executed meals i've ever had, albeit, the most expensive.I could rave on forever about the food. Eric Ripert is truly doing God's work in the kitchen. At first bite of the amuse bouche of scallops in some sort of fennel / saffron sauce, I knew we were in for a treat. What I wasn't prepared for, was the excellent service.The service, as expected was good. It was DAMN good. It was so good, that I never once had to ask for anything. It's like the waiters had a 6th sense about when I needed a re-fill of water or another glass of wine. Not only were they good, but they were very helpful and not overly pretentious. Case in point: My dining companion complained that our 4th course of sauteed skate wing was a bit too salty. The waiter profusely apologized, and not only replaced her skate wing, but replaced mine as well (mine wasn't that salty, but hell, I got a free skate wing out of it).Some might say the atmosphere is overly stuffy. The dining room decor is nothing spectacular, visually. The way that the servers sauce your plate after it's in front of you, and then explain in detail (in french accents mind you) about the dish, you feel as if you might as well hand over the fork and knife and have them hand feed you (here come's ze airplane!). The jacket only service, which not only caused much embarassment to the gentlement that showed up without jackets, but a somewhat uncomfortable dining experience, as I lived the entire night in fear of spilling bernaise on a blazer that cost as much as the entire dinner.The stiff formality and mediocre decor are forgivable, because when you chomp down on the best poached monkfish that's ever crossed your lips, the only thing that matters in the world is the incredible flavors in your mouth., Who dares putting only 4 stars?Don't get me wrong, we had a fantastic time here for Valentine's Day...the food was very, very good and well prepared. Our fav's were the warm oysters with caviar, raw scallops with truffles, turbot and dessert. We dined in the Salon, which is highly recommended plus its very quiet and intimate than dining below.Again the food was great, but some of the dishes main ingredients got lost or overwhelmed by potent sauces and over salting IMO. I love salty foods and dousing my steaks with A-1, but it was a bit too much...boy was I thirsty afterwards. Staff was great and very attentive. Was it worth 2 bills worth per person? Probably not that night, but I can guarantee its top notch any other day. I give it a very strong 4 stars!, My boyfriend and I could not have asked for a better place to celebrate our anniversary. The service was excellent, the setting was elegant (I was particularly enamoured with the flower arrangements), and the food was impeccable. Well worth the price.Shortly after we sat down, the waiter brought over a complimentary appetizer from the chef: a scallop immersed in a light, frothy broth served on a beautiful shell. I really liked the broth -- it was like drinking incredibly delicious soap bubbles.We both opted for the 4-course prix fixe menu. I started with the kanpachi tartare topped with wasabi tobiko. Oh. My. God. This was by far my favorite dish of the night. The wasabi tobiko added the most amazing flavor and texture to the tartare. It added just the right amount of spiciness to the fish without being overwhelming. They served it with a couple of thin slices of crostini, which I appreciated, though honestly I would have been fine just eating the tartare by itself.For the second course, I had the braised baby octopus with black truffle puree and red wine-ink sauce. Again, very tasty and beautiful presentation. The waiter poured the wine-ink sauce at the table, which I thought was a nice touch.My main course was the cod with stuffed sweet pepper and celery tandoor yogurt sauce. The entire dish had a distinctly Indian curry taste to it, and the fish was garnished with thin slivers of yogurt-tossed cucumber. I liked it for its uniqueness, and the cod was extremely tender. I was a tiny bit disappointed with the stuffed sweet pepper -- I couldn't even tell that it had been stuffed with anything, and it was a really small pepper. I was hoping for some more vegetable matter to offset the fish.The bf and I had a hard time deciding on dessert, so we went with the waiter's recommendation -- one hazelnut, and one passion fruit. I preferred the hazelnut, which was served with a few slices of caramelized banana, though the passion fruit was also great and should appeal to people who like fruity desserts. They also brought out plates of small after-dinner treats for each of us after we finished dessert.The wait staff is incredibly attentive and polite. They were so attentive, in fact, that I started feeling a little self-conscious. At one point my necklace hit my plate and made a loud clanging noise, and part of me wanted to crawl under the table. This all stems from my own personal paranoia though -- there was no indication of stuffiness on the part of the staff and they certainly were not judgmental at all., I would give it 4.5 star but since Yelp doesn't let you do that, I decided to give it a 5 anyways. We had the Le Bernardin tasting menu and every course is impeccably prepared and all the ingredient come together like harmony. The service was attentive but not too overbearing. I'm not a fan of jacket-only service, which means you have to eat wearing your jacket the whole time.So why did I want to give a 4.5 instead of 5? Well, I seconded some of the opinions posted by others that the sauces in some dishes are overpowering and too salty. I love salty, too but I had to avoid dipping in too much sauce. At first I thought it was one of the off nights but I saw Eric Ripert there himself. Well, he spent more time in the dining room having to chat with patrons than in the kitchen. Maybe that explains why the sauce was overlooked, haha.Overall, I think the multi-course tasting menu and experience was worth the price especially if you consider there are many more extravagant dining options in the city for food of the same caliber (ex. same price for only three courses at Daniel and Alain Ducasse's restaurants etc), Everything was very good, but nothing was stunning. From some of the other Michelin 2 and 3 stars I've been to, I expect one or two dishes to miss, and a few dishes to really wow me. At Le Bernardin, all the dishes were consistently good (if heavily seasoned), but none of them were that memorable. We had the Bernardin tasting menu.Some of the dishes that stood out to me that evening: The shrimp in the amuse bouche was a little on the rubbery side, which made it hard to cut, although the butternut squash sauce that went with it was good. There was a surprising lack of luxurious ingredients - no foie, very little black truffle. The sea bass was paired with duck, which didn't make much sense - the duck flavor and texture overwhelmed the fish. The monk fish was delicious - nice meaty texture and flavor which was complemented by the two sauces. The two desserts were interesting and good, especially the corn and chocolate dish - an unexpectedly good pairing.When I first walked in, I got the sense that it was a little stuffy, as some of the other yelpers had mentioned. But the feeling went away once we sat down in the dining room. The room was surprisingly rowdy. Our wait staff walked the line between endearing and awkward - stiff and trying to smile at the same time. Our sommelier was great - very charming and knowledgeable. They were all very attentative.Overall, an enjoyable experience. But I'd rather try some of the other great restaurants in NY before returning., 'Deserves the 5 star, I was there for a lunch and at $64 for a 3-course lunch, its good value for money. The creative menu is almost entirely seafood with little vegetarian and meat options (no complaints!) Great service and a lite yet fulfilling meal.', Went there on a Friday night for the tasting menu + wine pairing. The atmosphere surprised me, it was elegant yet simple and most importantly, not too haughty or pretentious. Couple other 'top rated' NYC restaurants feel like they treat you like a little kid if you don't look rich and over 50. Food as you'd expect for the prices was fresh and good. Wine pairing was surprisingly great, the sommelier went over each of her choices and gave a background of each selection. Each went with the dishes very well, and to my surprise, they didn't skimp on quantity, you definitely leave with a bit of a buzz (if you want of course).Only thing against this place has to be the absolute extravagance of the cost for the food. No food item absolutely stuns you, nothing was really that unique or interesting. Maybe I do not appreciate high-end cuisine but I simply don't think the meal was worth the tab, I have had just as good and interesting of seafood at NYC's other restaurants., 'My husband and I had dinner at Le Bernardin last November and it was by far the loveliest dining experience of our lives. We could only get a reservation at 10:30pm, as they were booked solid, but it was still packed at 10:30. We had the tasting menu with wine pairings which was absolutely delicious, cooked perfectly and served at just the right intervals. The service was flawless. I only had to look over my shoulder and a waiter was on hand immediately to ask if I needed to use the restroom. When I spilled a drop of water, a waiter came immediately with a cloth and club soda without asking. We left feeling as if we had just had a taste of heaven. It is expensive, but truly a once in a lifetime dining experience.', OK, different review. First off, LOVE it. Worth it. Michelin star experience all the way...but i am vegan....and went here for my birthday with my nonvegan hubby.problem? NO WAY!They made me special EVERYTHING! And every waiter and water-filler seemed to know that I was in fact vegan....which I have found can be forgotten at other busy non-service oriented restaurants. I had an amazing pasta with simple mainara sauce and I actually felt like it was worth the price--even though I stuck with mushrooms...veggies...pasta ectI love that place. Older crowd, but still livey. And YES you must wear formal attire. I don't know that we will be back anytime soon--it is a prix-fix event deal-, but if you want a special occasion dinner that makes you feel pampered and relaxed...Le B will not disappoint., I've only been here for the prix-fixe lunch, and while it's a bit pricey at $62, the 4 courses are absolutely delicious and the experience is amazing. Lunch here is a great way to taste the greatness of Le Bernadin without having to splurge for the pricier dinner. But one day I will splurge... one day! The service and food is exactly what you'd expect of a 3 star michelin restaurant. From the raw seafood to the cooked fish, it was all perfect.Eric Ripert is my hero. Watching him cook with Anthony Bourdain was amazing. Reading about how he made great meals from the 99 cent store in the New York Times yesterday makes me believe that he could probably make turd taste good., Le Bernardin received the highly regarded New York Times 4-star review only days after it's opening and has maintained its quality and integrity since. I don't want to reiterate the implied excellence of its service, dcor, food and the superior wine list. A note for caution is that this is not the most romantic restaurant for date nights. The oversized tables, proper atmosphere and the brightness of lighting create a less than intimate ambiance. However, you cannot go wrong with le Bernadin for special family gatherings and corporate client dinners., My mother and I are foodies, and this is obviously one of the top destinations in New York for people like us. I've been there for lunch and dinner, and it's amazing how completely different the atmosphere can be. The first time we went for dinner and the service was impeccable. Our lunch experience was less enjoyable. The restaurant morphs into a corporate cafeteria during the day and our waiter was quite brusque, not to mention our table was the worst in the house. We did end up being seated next to a table with former senator John Breaux, and the political gossip we overheard was pretty priceless. (Bill Clinton + Catherine Zeta Jones: really?!) If you go, go for dinner. Be prepared to spend $400+ for two. Avoid the tuna as a first course (bland, as was the monkfish), but absolutely try the braised baby octopus. It is one of my favorite dishes ever. I'm not sure if they still serve it, but the flourless chocolate cake with olive oil was also sublime. For lunch, we go to Bouley now--it's a lot more fun., I eat a lot of desserts - (my brother's girlfriend just got hired at Per Se for Pastries). and I eat a lot of fish. It's my job. (Killing and eating fish.).The meal (lunch) was capped off with DELICIOUS, innovative desserts. Unfortunately I went there for the fish - the technique used was fine but the freshness was not up to par and two fish dishes were exceedingly salty I had to force it down. The fish was tough and encumbered by sauce. It warrants another try, as I like Ripert and what he has done for seafood...my brother even bought me slate to cook fish on for Christmas (ripert).-fishyman., 'Excellent restaurant and probably because Eric Ripert has not whored himself out like every other top chef.', 'An exquisite dining experience. Service was top notch, everyone was super polite and not haughty. From the moment you enter to the moment you leave, great attention is paid to every detail. Everything which was served to us (from the amuse bouche through dessert) was perfect...taste, quality, texture, etc. This place is the real deal.', 'EXQUISITE!!! (Only if you like seafood. Stop reading if youe a seafood (fish) lover).Although I didn experience the full dinner tasting menu, I dined here for lunch and was able to get a feel for what dinner has to offer. My mom and I were blown away. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, everything is exactly what we expected it to be and even more. I thought Ie dined at some fine places, but the service elsewhere does not compare to this. I may need to lower some of my 5 star ratings b/c service doesn even come close to this.As for the food, the lunch is a $66 prix fixe and although I like choices, there were too many choices. I had a real hard time deciding what to get, but that when our server came to rescue. I chose the tuna with fois grois on a baguette and had the red snapper for my entree. Absolutely wonderful!! Not one complaint. The tuna just melted in my mouth and complimented the fois grois perfectly. My mom had the crab cake and the black bass (a fish wee never had). The crab cake had fresh crab chunks. Both the red snapper and black bass were cooked to perfection. I find it so hard these days to find fish cooked the right way. A lot of times, fish is overdone. To back up a step, before our appetizers came out, we were served with a smoked salmon salad that came with thin slices of baguette toast. OMG, soooo good!! I had to force myself to stop eating it so I wouldn get full. Even my mother who is not a fan of smoked salmon or raw tuna, enjoyed both. For dessert, I had the carrot cake with condensed milk ice cream and my mom had yuzu (not exactly sure what it is) w/green tea ice cream. Both desserts perrrrfeeeccttooo(again like the rest of our meal). I loved that the carrot cake didn have any nuts (I hate nuts). Presentation of all dishes were simple yet extremely well presented. Portions were perfect. As I write this review, I wish I could frequent this place more often. (**Drool.....)Thank you LB for the BEST lunch dining experience ever!!! Worth every penny of it!! Hope to visit for dinner in the future.', I've updated this to 5 stars because, well, aside from some grit in the morels with the scallops, everything was PERFECT. I mean, it was so perfect it was ridiculous. We got an amazing bottle of wine and it complemented all 5/7 courses as requested. Kudos to the sommelier!!! Our favorites were the smoked salmon, lobster, and the blue cheese/gorgonzola, along with the Hawaii'n white tuna. All the sauces were seasoned with keeping in mind that the fish was not seasoned prior to cooking/prep. To some, the sauces may have been too salty, but to me they were great! The black bass and celery salad, was awesome with the salad being (ironically) my favorite part of the course. Note to self: shaved celery with sherry vinegar is a good combo!The service was to be expected: impeccable, if not insanely perfectionistic - but in a good way.I had a problem with the seared scallops and morels - the morels had a lot of teeny tiny grit in them... (Chef Ripert!!! What happened?! I've never had morels with grit in them?! Why? Was it a particular kind of season to do that to the morels? But you know what? The sauce and scallops were so good I forgot about the grit!) The olive tapenade with the blue fin tuna almost overpowered the tuna WITHOUT the micro-basil to balance it out - was too much olive tapenade... But that is nit-picking because everything was really, really good!!! Will totally come back!!! Next time, no chef's tasting menu, just the standard prix fixe...|3
27|longman-and-eagle-chicago|'Great! Tremendous job on their first real night open. The food was spot on and our server Will was great as well. I wish this restaurant the best of luck!', Must say I'm impressed. Apparently opened by the owners of the Empty Bottle, this place is much classier than I expected, which made me nervous when I walked in, but after pa-rousing their extensive and expensive drink menu, I was put to ease when I saw the $2 PBR. I indulged in two Pabst and a $3 shot of rye whiskey on the rocks, my wife a glass of wine. Also had a nice spread of house olives and the Kobe Beef meatballs. Our friends ate the beef tongue hash with duck egg, all of which was great. With tip, we spent $32 as a couple. Super worth it. In all a nice step up in dinning for the area without letting go of that hipster neighborhood edge. I like it lots., I loved it!! The food is pretty high brow for a bar , or is it a restaurant with a really big drink selection? I don't know, I loved it through! The environment is a little rustic but simple and classy. It felt like a modern day saloon. The guy from Boulevard bikes is a bartender there.I can't wait until the 45's start jamming next week, its 50 cents for 7 songs!! what a deal! Our 7 selections are in there...so they'll be the first ones to played once they get that part.The kitchen is open and you can see all the yummy plates go by, which is how we got tempted to put our name down for a table opening night. We had the scallop with oxtail and gnocchi, the olives, the ravioli with crisp sage, and the pretzel and rarebit. While i felt like the portions were a little small for the price, my friends thought that it was enough though. Maybe I just want more of everything when it's good.They have Matilda on tap for 8 bucks, and Maudite for 6! This is gonna be a popular spot in the hood for sure., 'I wandered in after a community meeting a couple of nights ago and it turned out this was their friends and family opening, with their official opening being last night. The vibe was so warm, the food so outstanding, that I can wait to go back. I talked to one of the owners and he said they wanted the place to feel like a big hug. It also going to be a B&B, modeled after those English country inns. Their motto is sleep. eat. whiskey. It owned by Empty Bottle Presents but will not have live music, but rather a DJ some nights. Needless to say, the music they had playing the other night set the perfect tone over a good sound system. Thank you for coming to Logan Square, Longman and Eagle!', Brilliant! Tasty! I can't wait to sample the entire menu. Loved the ambiance, the music on the jukebox, the service, the beer selection and - most of all - the food. I was also dazzled by the wall of bourbon selections. This place is great., 'Great vibe and decor. Went in with four friends and was immediately welcomed and seated. The Wild Boar Sloppy Joe was excellent - knife and fork required. The drink selection was amazing (and the prices reasonable). A great spot for a date, or to bring some friends for drinks and good food. Also, for the second night, they really had their act together. Out waitress split our check (between three different people) without missing a beat. Fantastic service, outstanding food, and some marvelous drinks.', Loved it! I'm so glad this place opened in the neighborhood--it reminds me very much of my favorite whiskey bar/gastropub in SF (Alembic).Four of us went on their second day open--food and service were amazing. We arrived around 6:30-ish and were told the wait would be about 30 minutes. We got some drinks and hung out over by the kitchen and 30 minutes later, our table was ready.Since it was their second day, I was expecting service hiccups. Nope! Our apps, mains, and dessert (you HAVE to get the choco/banana bread pudding) all arrived perfectly on time and tasting great. Food highlights: scallops/oxtail/gnocchi, kobe burger, sweetbreads...YUM! I need to come back for the bone marrow for sure.I can't wait to go back to try everything else on the menu., '**Edit**: Wow. I getting hate mail for posting a 1 star review and expecting to eat within 2.5 hours of entering an establishment. Really? Drea C., you can think I a dumb b*tch, but really I was just stating my experience. Not expecting to be treated like a king. My review below is fair and accurate. THAT being said, the owner also KINDLY emailed me, recalled the situation, apologized for the situation and asked if he could rectify the situation, so I am bumping this up to 2 stars due to fine customer service after the fact. If I ever decide to go back, I will definitely let you all know how it is. Even you, Drea C. Original review below...**We did everything right. We knew attempting to go to a new, neighborhood gastropub on the Saturday night of its opening week would come along with a wait. So we called ahead and they assured us it haven been more than a 45 minutes wait so far. I also found a blog with a review stating that theyl take your phone number and call you when your table is ready anyway...perfect. Our party of 4 arrived around 8pm and was told we had an hour wait, gave them our phone number and went two doors down to El Cid Tacos for a drink.Two margaritas too many we realized it had been about 1.5 hours with no call, so we closed our tab and walked over there thinking our table had to be within a drink away.We checked back in at Longman & Eagle and were told that we were the next 4 top to be seated as soon as two 2 tops could be squeezed together. We crammed in and ordered another drink from their bar where we waited 30 MORE minutes (2 hours at this point) until we saw a beacon of hope... a 4 top was paying their bill! We cashed out with our cocktail waitress, hovered over the table while it was cleaned and what did the hostess do at this point? SEAT ANOTHER PARTY OF 4 INSTEAD. Right in front of our face! I tapped her shoulder in disbelief and said, You showed me the list and told us we were the next 4-top, we have been waiting over 2 hours, when you said it would be one, I think you are mistaken and this is our table. She swiftly said, Nope they are first and walked back to her station.At this point we each set our almost finished drinks at the hostess station and left. It didn seem like they minded if they lost our business or not, but this will go down as the worst restaurant at which Ie never ate.In the end, their lack of regard or apology for their oversight was what was most alarming when they are trying to make nice in the new neighborhood. Other reviewers that were lucky enough to get a seat seemed to like it, but to me this place was just complete snobbery in a flannel facade.FYI: I a carnivore, but to my vegetarian friends out there, from staring at their menu during our long wait I noticed that even their meat-free (fries) and seafood options state that they are cooked in animal fats or plated with meat as well. Again, wouldn bother me, but might bother some.', 'The atmosphere of an old Chicago inn that the owners were trying to create in Longman and Eagle was certainly present without it seeming like it was some sort of corporate design or movie set. I think it was that much of the furniture, and maybe even the fixtures were handmade that created a real sense of place. I would advise against ordering a chocotini, but instead asking for a bottle of Old Crow and a shot glass. A bar just like this does not exist anywhere else that Ie ever been. I am a big fan of bars that do not have a television; this bar and Cole are two that opened in Logan Square recently. They are putting several hotel rooms upstairs in the spring, and when you see the drink list you will know why.Now on to the whiskey. They have 23 one ounce shots available for $3, double that for two ounces. Of these, six begin with the word old. There are other aptly named whiskeys on that list such as Rebel Yell, Virginia Lightning, Fighting Cock, and Georgia Moon. The last whiskey mentioned comes in a mason jar and tastes like lighter fluid. More popular brands such as Maker Mark, Jack Daniels, and Jim Beam are also on the $3 list along with many more that are at various prices. If you brought about $60 here, you could kill yourself. The bar also has several beers on tap. The focus seems to be on local breweries such as Goose Island and Half Acre, most of which go for $5. For those that are cheap, there is Old Style on tap for $3, and cans of PBR for $2.', 'I am almost afraid to add another 5 star review to this place. See, I live 2 blocks from here and was hoping to make this place my new second home. It going to be hard to do that if all these great reviews make it impossible to get a seat here! My lady and I went here for dinner on Friday evening thinking let check out the new place. Little did we know it would be one of the best meals of our lives. Maybe that a bit of hyperbole...but it was damn delicious. We waited patiently for our table at the bar and became jealous as amazingly presented plates passed by us. After only a few minutes an employee came by and offered to take our coats! We ordered a second round of drinks and because of a slight mix up were given them at half price. Once seated (a little over an hour), and despite being at capacity, the waiters made sure we were well taken care of. And they were friendly!Unfortunately, they were out of the Wild Boar Sloppy Joe (which can also be looked at as; they get their food fresh). So instead we had to settle for the Duck Egg on Beef tongue hash and black truffle sauce. I never knew an egg could be so delicious! It cut like a piece of meat. We also had the Ravioli with shaved foie gras and mushrooms, Kobe beef meatballs and creamy polenta, and Candy apple & butternut squash puree in salty caramel sauce. Everything was outstanding. Final bill: $40 (not including 2 rounds of drinks at the bar). I would not have been surprised if we paid double that considering the food we ate. Reasonably priced food + great, friendly service + good beer = my new favorite place.', 'I wish I could give this place 6 stars!A group of myself and 5 friends came here for dinner last night and were blown away! The food was phenomenal!They offer both small appetizers and plates which can we shared among large groups. We ordered 3 plates for the table. 1- a ricotta dish that was to die for 2 - scallops with ox tail that was scrumptious! 3 - sweetbreads, which I didn try because I not a sweetbreads person, but everyone else loved.I ordered the Kobe burger for dinner. HOLY COW - this was the best burger I have ever had. It served on a brioche bun with duck fat fries (YUM). I feel like I can;t even call it a burger because it was really so much more than just a burger. Hands down the best Ie ever had in my entire life.My friend ordered the Wild bore sloppy joe, I got to taste it, the quality of the meat was top notch and I almost wish I ordered that instead. The porkbelly (servered on pumpkin risotto AMAZING) was also spectacular.We ordered 1 of each dessert and there wasn a drop left of anything, we all loved it!They also have a great beer selection and a pretty awesome whiskey list as well as a whiskey tasting special.GO HERE, OR MISS OUT!', 'I went to Longman and Eagle for the first time this past Friday after the city has been abuzz about this place in the first week of opening! I have to stay I was incredibly impressed by the food here. L&E was pretty crowded but after about an hour and a half of drinking at the bar we got a table. Other patrons here were super friendly and easy to talk to and I loved that people were sharing their small plates with people they didnt know.As I said the food was delicious and I will be here soon to try more. I tried the rabbit pate, clam belly strips and scallops with oxtail ragu. The rabbit pate was delciously prepared and homemade. The scallops came perfectly cooked with a tasty sauce and bits of cheese perfectly paried with the oxtail ragu made each bite a taste of heaven. I can wait til they start serving brunch at L&E. This is definitely one of my new spots!', oh lord.so good it kind of hurts.. It reminds me of a cross between a high class old timey saloon and a new classy restaurant. Lots of beautiful hardwoods, high ceilings.. there are two adjoining rooms that are both intimate in size, it feels quite perfect for the food being served.delicious meat,, I mean, REALLY delicious. And its funny because I love and believe in the concept of useing the entire animal.. if you are going to kill it, nothing should be wasted. But then when served beef cheek, as in, the inside of a cow's mouth, i bit my lip.. and then tasted it.FYI-- COW CHEEK IS AMAZING!!!everything ruled. i had the catfish that i had to force myself to slow down and savour it. Friends had the veal (oh man.. so good) the scallops, the sausage sandwich, and the sloppy joe. It was all profoundly delicious, such great flavors! and the servings were perfect. It left you satisfied in a healthy way, not in a side splitting way, and i didnt want to like the plate because i hadnt gotten enough.. i wanted to lick the plate though. just because its deliciousness was still on it a little!we finished up with the banana bread pudding. it made me close to weeping with awesomeness.so... i want to eat every meal there now. all of them. so good. ouch. go. do it. you'll have to wait. big deal. or wait a year. or go early. just, go., Flippen Awesome! In person I used a different F word. I live across the circle from this place and feel like I just won some kind of gastronomical lottery! The food is amazing, the staff well informed and gracious, and the drinks rock.We were there promptly at 5pm when they opened and there was already a group of four people waiting to get in! Guess the word is out. We were all seated quickly and our server was over in flash to sort out our order. My BF and I had a divide and conquer strategy with the menu and drinks list. He went for the whiskey tasting and I ordered us up the Gnudi with crispy sage, Scallops with Oxtail, and Kobi meatballs on polenta. We were not messing around. Within minutes our drinks and amuse bouche of beets with a whipped goat cheese drizzeled with truffle oil arrived at the table. Why thank you &, don't mind if I do!The food rolled out at a pleasant pace starting with the Seared Scallops & Braised Oxtail, potato gnocchi and Fontina fonduta. A healthy portion for $12. This was my favorite starter by far. The scallops were perfectly seared and the oxtail was melt in your mouth delicious. The Gnudi was a fun cheesey take on gnocchi and very delicately placed on the plate with a leaf of crispy sage placed on top. I could snack on crispy sage all night, yum. The gnudi themselves were very good, but I think I prefer the gnocchi that came with the Scallops. Simply a style choice or maybe I just prefer my Italian dumplings covered with oxtail and fonduta. The meatballs were delicious and although I don't usually use this word to describe meatballs, they were delicate and very tasty. We could have stopped right then and been satisfied, but we wanted more. We decided that the Veal Breast with Bacon Brussel Spouts and Beef Cheek Manicotti was the next dish on deck. And let me say to the Chef, well done sir! The veal was tender enough to cut with my fork and the sauce had us in a zen like state.I'm not sure where we found the room but we simply had to try the Chocolate Bannana Bread pudding and it was wonderful. It was moist, rich, and we damn near licked the bowl clean. It's been a while since I looked at a menu and saw so very many things that looked so unbelievably delicious. I'm coming back this week with my girlfriends in tow. I have them convinced it's for their sake, because I want to share this great new restaurant with them. But really it's purely and selfishly, so I can have more people with me to taste more of that menu. For the record how many times is it socially acceptable to visit a restaurant within a week without being pegged as a stalker?, 'Longwait but all the more Eager. I heard rumblings about this place a short time back and set my sights on going opening weekend. The rooms that will soon be available for overnight stays above the restaurant were enough to pique my curiosity. Anyone else imagine it was going to look like a saloon out of the wild west with rooms upstairs guarded by railings? It didn...but I reckon the selection of whiskey was stiff enough for any gunslinger in this here county of Cook. I expected a full house, but I was surprised to find that I could pass the time with other patrons who gathered around the bar, not just to wait, but to share excited reactions, thoughts, and the occasional cod dipped chip with those around them. While sipping Hot Toddies, Old-fashioned, Manhattan, and other speak-easy reinventions , you have to stop yourself from starting and closing each one of your exclamations over the bar treats with, look here!...this tastes f-ing amazing you see?Once we were seated, we were two drinks in with whetted appetites. We stated our intended budget and placed full faith in the server for making the selctions. Out came a detailed, well-informed, description from his finely groomed mustache of the culinary odyssey we were about to begin.We burrowed our way through some bone marrow, ate some cow cheek, had a shots of whiskey, ate lamb, had new unibroue beers he suggested, and i can remember what we were brought for dessert by then (I was still distracted by the care that went into labeling the two stalls in the men bathroom with signs Sit and Stand) but i remember it being really good. In all honesty, it exceeded my expectations. Fun crowd, good food, great drinks, and a friendly staff.', 'On a whim last night I decided to check out this new Logan Square bar/restaurant with two of my friends. From the second we sat down, our service was absolutely exemplary. For starters we were offered our choice of either still or sparkling water (we chose sparkling). I spent close to 14 years in the service industry and I have to say our busboy was one of the best Ie ever seen. Not only did my water glass NEVER get below half full, but he was also exceptionally enthusiastic about the establishment, and had such nice things to say about all the menu items. It made choosing my entree all the more difficult because he already made everything sound soooo good!Our waiter, Willy Duncan was awesome! He gave us a thorough run down of the drink choices, and suggested some dangerously great beers and whiskey. The selection of $3 whiskey shots is both amazing AND a recipe for trouble of the best variety.As an appetizer, we started out with a scallop soup that had some sort of creme fresh and was infused with sunflower oil....everything on the menu was so ornate and the attention to the detail in the food really shined through with every bite.For entrees I chose the veal cutlet atop brussel sprouts with beef cheeck mannicotti. Just writing this right now sends shivers of happiness through my whole body. I not even kidding here, but for the first time in my life, i find myself savoring a meal the next morning. I cannot wait to go back!Aside from the amazing food, you should also stop by their 7 jukebox to see what may be the best 7 jukebox in the entire world. I mean seriously....Brainiac Internationale 7? King Khan? Kurt Vile? Nirvana Sliver/Iodine? Bob & Gene? It like someone raided my dream 7 collection and put it into a jukebox. Outstanding.This place makes me happy to be alive.', I'm tempted to write about what an amazing place this is...but that will only mean I won't ever get a table! So, instead I'm going to tell all of you that you probably won't like it ;)...you should definitely stay away from this place...hehe, yeah....don't bother., A++++ I know I'm just repeating what everyone else said, but this place is really great. The atmosphere is very laidback and the food is outstanding. Extensive beer, wine and whiskey list to please all drinkers. Kobe meatball and rabbit pate apps were great, as were the Kobe burger and veal entree. We ran into some friends right after we ordered and they gladly changed our table of two to a table of four. Service was friendly and fast. My only complaint is that they ran out of sweetbreads., 'Solid establishment.Excellent location (steps from Blue Line, #76 / #56, and my condo).Superb service, all around.Great musical selection.Interesting table decor.Complimentary, in-house filtered still or sparkling water.Oh yeah, and incredible food, interesting preparations and lots and lots of bourbon. With many $3 shots listed prominently on the drink menu./swoon', This place totally lives up to all of the hype! I have to say, this was one of the best meals that I've had in a long time. The catfish, collards and grits were amazing. My friend's pork belly was amazing (which I typically dont like, but they do it right). The whiskey selection can be a little intimidating, but our server did a great job of guiding us. We experienced one little glitch... our cheese plate took a bit long to arrive and our entrees arrived before one of our starters. But for a week old restaurant, I can overlook it. All in all, we had a fabulous night. Great staff, cool spot, delicious food. Cant wait to see the inn upstairs when it opens. Thanks Longman & Eagle!, $3 1oz Whiskey Shots !!!!!!!!!!!Extensive Beer List, including two on draft from local Half Acre Brewing Co. Came here last night around 930 and the place was packed. Unfortunately, they were out of the Over Ale, so I ordered a shot of Jameson and a Dogfish 60 min IPA. Gave the waitress 2 -$5's to cover the bill and couldn't have been more pleased with the drinks. She routinely checked back, and honestly, I'm not sure how she was able to finagle her way through the crowded room, but she did. I will certainly be back here soon.The only downside is that this bar is EXTREMELY popular since it just opened, so expect to wai, DH and I arrived for an early dinner, and enjoyed watching the restaurant fill in around us. They have Unibroue, with Maudite on tap. Mmmm. Kobe meatballs with polenta, the wild boar sloppy joe, and the roasted cauliflower dish were all made with evident care, and consumed with relish. It's the coziest, friendliest place I can think of in Chicago. I can't wait to go back and try some whisky.p.s. don't miss out on the bread pudding. so. good., 'This place is worth the hype. i only waited about 35 minutes for a table which, i expecting to wait longer. I loved everything about the place including the wallpaper in the bathroom.The wait staff was super friendly and personable. The kobe meatballs & wild boar sloppy Joe were excellent..I will def be back.', Named in homage to a SR22 insurance company television commercial mascot, this establishment features chill food and delicious atmosphere; it's like Montmartre meets Portland in Lil' San Juan. My only problem: when do I get to come back? No, seriously, when will that restraining order be lifted? I luv you, Longman & Eagle! Lay an egg on my car hood before the locals steal my car battery!, I am so impressed by this place considering it has just opened... This place knows exactly what it is... from the decor to the menu, etc. Everything is focused and feels self-assured. I had the yuzu toddy (amazing!! I had two of these), pumpkin risotto with pork belly, oxtail/scallops, and tried the roast chicken dish. The risotto/pork belly was a little on the sweet side for me, but good. Everything else was great too. Probably not the most mindblowingly good food I've ever had, but definitely solid, and the price points (entrees average around 25-30 bux) were reasonable. It's the overall package that I appreciate... I've been to restos with a similar feel in Brooklyn and the Lower East Side in NYC that I've been waiting to open in Chicago. Thanks to L & E we finally have one!Finally, I so appreciate that although the food may be a bit upscale, the drink menus are insanely affordable (as mentioned here in the other reviews), so you can still have high quality drinks in a polished but down-to-earth environment at the bar with upscale, affordable bar snacks., 'I dunno... I just am having a hard time with this place. I had a good time and spent more money than I wanted to. Longman and Eagle is in the space once occupied by The Winds Cafe... which was terrible. But, The Winds kept the neighborhood pegged as a place Lincoln Parkers wouldn come to. when I arrived, blonde girls with heels were getting out of cabs complaining that they were cold. Cabs are very un-Logan Square. I hope they were just there because they read about it on Metromix. This place will be wildly popular while not being the best at anything. For example-- the Kobe burger? Delicious but not a Kuma burger. The cocktails? Wonderful, but not as good as The Whistlers. The Beef fat fries? Superb, but not as tasty as Hot Doug Duck fat fries. Get my drift? One more gripe-- the lights are super dim, which is great for ambiance. However, their menu is in about 8pt font and on a natural tone paper, making it nearly impossible to read. I looked around the room and everyone was holding their menus to the candle light and squinting to read. That said, it nice to have a classy joint in the neighborhood with good food and tasty drinks. I just hope it doesn come with a side of douchebag. I was just starting to like this neighborhood.', 'Holy crap, I will be a regular here for sure. $4 Gin & Tonics and great gastro-pub food! A please-all interior and wonderful people-watching. It is Logan Square after all. Drink here.', We stopped here after a movie at the Logan Theatre. We were told it would be an hour and a half wait for a table for two, and I was not too keen on waiting that long, but we got seats at the bar fairly quickly and decided to eat there. The hostess told us our table was ready shortly after that, but we stayed at the bar. So their estimated wait was about twice as long as what it turned out to be.We both had the house special hot toddy, and it was warm and lemony delicious. The bar is well-stocked, with what appears to be a strong bias for whiskeys, and a nice selection of tap and bottled brews. The menu reveals Longman & Eagle to be an interesting gastropub, with plenty of meat selections, but also a fair number of fish and veg items. We started with the pretzel with Welsh rarebit, a cheesy mustardy sauce I had never before tried. Very tasty. The pretzel was warm, crispy on the outside, and unsalted. I moved on to the sunchoke bisque with scallops. The bisque was quite creamy and delicious, but I did have one problem with it. It was a fairly small portion served in an oversized bowl, and the bowl very obviously cooled the bisque before it made it to my seat at the bar. It was warm in the center, but quite lukewarm near the edges. A bowl that size containing a smaller portion of soup, should have been preheated, in my opinion. I think this was a fairly amateur mistake, and one easily corrected. Hopefully they will see this review and do just that.Other than that, I loved the place. The service was excellent. it did get fairly crowded and noisy at the bar, but that's the way it goes at a hot new spot on a Friday night. The ambiance is everything a Logan Square gastropub should be, and maybe even more. I'll be back for sure!, The food at this place aims high but falls flat. If you want great pub food just go to the publican. I've eaten the burger which was kind of pathetic and the marrow bones which were great but served with some kind of disgusting mystery relish. The sausage is pretty gross too (how about setting your grinder to a thicker setting?) My friend ordered a soup that had about four spoonfuls in it. They do have a respectable beer selection at fair prices and alcoholics will love the $3 whiskey menu. I'd recommend going here after dinner at Lula but avoid the food at all costs., Wow! This place is awesome! We went there on a Saturday afternoon around 4. It was just beginning to get busy. We sat down at the 2 top right next to the door, and ordered a couple of beers (Leffe and St Ambroise Oatmeal Stout). Their predinner food menu was limited, but we ordered the olives and the rabbit pate with homeade giardinara. Both of these items were very tasty. After another round of beers, there was a shift change, so we closed out with our server. Unfortunately there was some confusion and our new server didn't attend to us, so I had to talk to our previous server. She apologized and had the manager take care of us (she sent over free shots of bourbon). Nice! My girlfriend doesn't drink bourbon, so more for me!  New server was very pleasant and took care of us immediately when she was made aware of our situation. We then ordered the Kobe meatballs with polenta and the fried clam bellies with brioche and a slaw remoulade. Those clams were some of the tastiest bites I've eaten in a while. You have to try this if you go here. The flavors combined perfectly. And the meatballs were pretty good. They were a little overcooked, but the polenta was some of the creamiest, tastiest I've ever had. We're definitely going back soon. But I'm guessing this place is going to get hot real quick. So check it out before it gets out of control. Lastly, the prices are very reasonable, especially the food. Most of their appetizers are under $10 and most of the entrees are under $25., 'When I first moved to the ood (1996), this was a scary bar, the kind where a dozen or so men would turn and give you the stink-eye as you walked past the open door. Most of us old-timers remember Carlos the drunk, who always slept it off in the parkway in front of the bar. One time I saw the cops roll him over to see if he was still alive. Then, it became Smoke, owned by the same people who bought the Matchbox. It could have been an early Logan Square success story. However, he refused to get air-conditioning, even when Chicago was in the throes of a major heat wave. Unsurprisingly, it failed. Then, The Winds. Oye vey--what a waste of a good spot. Straight out of the gate, at top speed and form, comes Longman & Eagle. L&E is part of the Empty Bottle corporation, which explains the ready-to-go quality of this new establishment. They seem to be able to keep the small kitchen cranking; the plates are small, but done beautifully. The wait and bar staff are experienced, professional and kind of cute, quite frankly. Visiting at off-times is recommended. We dined there early (7:00) on a Wednesday evening. Although our wait for a table was brief, by 8:00 pm, the place was jammed. Perhaps because of the custom wood ceilings, the acoustics are great for conversation.', If you want to see the most interesting effort to brand oneself as an ampersand, then Longman & Eagle is the place for you. A small group of us had dinner here on a Saturday night after an accurate heads up for a 2 hour wait. Quick note, but it may help to call ahead here. For groups of 6 or more, they may be able to hook you up with a reservation, but they're scarce. Still, friendly staff that were polite, efficient, and friendly.Moving on to the bar, we enjoyed the full range of beer (nice variety on tap), 3 buck whiskies (the list is also comprehensive for the price), and a few cocktails to round it out. The cocktail list was lighter than I thought it would be, maybe 6ish choices. But, some were interesting takes on more traditional cocktails without selling out for shock value. While it wasn't my favorite drink that night, there was a gimlet-ish drink with an interesting mix of Tanq, lime, and chartreuse that is worth a look (thanks Molly O for the heads up). Felt more like a summer drink than the arctic Chicago evening we were out in, but a good drink is still a good drink. Someone also tried the Manhattan and the hot toddy with yuzu... that one may become a new cold remedy.I think somewhere in the evening we sat down and ate dinner. I couldn't pass up the pork belly and pumpkin risotto; pretty good, but fair warning that its as heavy as it sounds - twas a bit fatty, even for pork belly. Bring an appetite. For me the buzz was worth it. Its not original, or some crazy new place - it does a few important things really well. High marks for value - great food at a competitive price versus other similar places. The friendly laid-back service sealed the deal - I'll be heading back soon (well, when the snow takes a break)., 'The kobe burger, with aged cheddar and bacon, is delicious. The place is a bit uppity, like youe supposed to be the type of person who calls themselves a foodie to go here. But the drinks are solid, the service is friendly enough, and it not too pricey. Beware though, that you gotta go early to avoid a wait, because this place is popular.I will say that my best pals who went here had the same complaint that I had: the server was a pretentious douche. Smile for once, dude, and I sorry that I had the temerity to ask twice what kind of cheese was on the cheese plate.', 'So I just moved to Chicago and am staying in the logan square area. The main reason for me moving here is the huge foody scene so this is my first of many reviews. Upon arriving asked my friend where we should go and his first though was longman. We get there the thing I noticed was the great atmosphere. We were there pretty late so we just had a few split plates. The first thing we had was the bone marrow with toast, which was absolutely perfect, asked my friend if he thought it was an accident because thats how perfect it was, and he simply says that it has been that way every time. After the marrow we moved on to infamous wild boar sloppy joe which is worth going to this place alone for. The only unsuccessful dish to us was the rarebit which consisted of a pretzel and what was supposed to be in my mind beer fondu, but came out tasting like a beer roux, which is not appetizing at all. Never the less I will be back and am looking forward to it and will strongly recommend Longman & Eagle to everyone I know.', 'This place is rad. Take the Publican and mix it with the Empty Bottle - and I think you get the picture of this place. For all those yelpers who go on about how much they hate hipsters for their dingy hangouts and apathetic service: Longman & Eagle proudly tells you to eat your heart out. Or, better yet - some Duck Egg w/ Beef Cheek Hash and truffle vinaigrette.', 'Yum! Table of 4. Shared the beef fat potato chips and some sort of duck pate on crostini. Very good. I had the plate of sunchokes and scallops and a salad with roasted beets, goat cheese, walnuts and a bacon vinegrette. Wanted to like the plate good. Another ordered the roasted veggies and lentils and liked it very much and another ordered the Duck Egg w/ beef hash. Another ordered the marrow (not my thing) and liked it but felt there was very little to it. These were all off the plate menu and not the entrees and the only complaint I heard, wish I had more Creative, different and tasty. And not over priced. Including wine and tip 115$ for 4 people. small plates and small place. No bigger tables.', 'So not impressed. The food was okay. The service was mediocre. I wanted to like it, I really did. But I will not be making a return visit.', Things to do with wild boars: play Hopscotch with them or make sloppy joes out of them. Thankfully Longman & Eagle chose the latter, and in the process, may have created the pageant winner of sandwiches.It's soggy, oozing perfection topped with a fantastically erect jalapeno. You almost want to order this sandwich, take it upstairs to one of the 6 inn rooms they'll be opening next month, and have your way with it. Wait, that's twisted and gross. Everything else was stellar - the cheese plate, the scallops, the bouillabaisse, the drinks, the affected hipsters- but you just won't be able to get that damn ground up wild boar out of your head., Young, middle- class white kids with upper class aspirations all milling around- enjoying flights of Bourbon, and well- presented delectable food. Great location- as all the humans that consider themselves a precious gift to the world live within a mile radius of the logan square blue line stop. The problem is that it's as crowded with shoulder to shoulder tables and stools as a Thai restaurant during lunch special. Which I don't mind, if I don't have to spend the entire time concerned that a stray beard hair will be carried through the blustery conversations of those plaid -shirted fellows that dot the place, and into my drink. Perhaps a solution to this would be having all the men wear those beard nets that they wear in restaurant kitchens?, Alrighy now, let's be a little objective here. I know that we are all excited to have a new spot in Logan Square but there are some issues to address here. I will be upfront and say that I did not eat when I was here but that was mostly due to the fact that there were few if any items that I could eat. I looked and looked at the menu and I believe that there were 3 maybe 4 items on the entire menu that didn't include beef or pork. The scallops had beef, one salad was made with a bacon dressing, the list continues. If you eat anything and everything and could care less about the number of calories, grams of fat and your cholesterol level then you should be happy here. The food did look and smell delicious but I am really tired of places that serve pork with their pork. Impress me with something that I've never heard of before or tasted together. Besides that the bar is cool and old fashioned. The crowd on a Wednesday night was very Logan Square hipster. And it was pretty packed at 7pm when I got there. It thinned out a bit by 8:30. I can't even imagine how packed this place must get on the weekends. It was a typical loud bar which also might not be ideal for a nice dinner out. The staff was very nice and helpful. The beer list was great and the whiskey list is phenomenal. They did have a cool old juke box which had some good tunes on it. I know there was music playing when I was there but I couldn't tell you what it was. My only other complaint was that the bathrooms were a bit dirtier than I would expect. I hope that is something that they fix quickly. I will go back sometime to try one of the few items on the menu that I can eat. Until then I can't give it a completely fair review. So far it is a nice place to grab a beer or whiskey but expect it to be crowded if you go at a peak time., If the band The Decemberists opened a restaurant, this would be it. The aesthetic of the place is sort of Early Chicago, meets Logan Square Hipster. Okay let's break it down:The scene: restaurant in front, bar in back, Inn on top...Just like in the olden days : )....The ceiling is fascinating. Beautiful old woods all melded together. My date caught me staring at the ceiling many times. He wasn't even boring! The bathrooms are adorable. JR Watkins soap...Nice touch...The food: We kept it simple...Kobe burger with OMG bacon and OMG cheddar and Wild Boar Sloppy Joes. It was food to savor. Seriously, I hit the table with joy and scared the waiter standing next to me. : ) The full menu food is like Old School American fused with modern cuisine. I can't wait to try more!The cost: For Chicago? Pretty cheap for farm raised everything. Pretty damn cheap actually...Oh joy! I love this place., I will keep it brief. I love my neighborhood and I want to support any independently owned business in it but I will not do this blindly. But when you feel like a restaurant is really working hard to do it right, you can't help but fall in love with it. Ths place simply gets it. From the design to the menu to the service, we just really felt like this was a place that really cares. We ordered lightly and cautiously but everything we had was creative and perfectly done and we will back to try everything. The staff was warm and humble. Bravo!, 'Make sure to try the Wild Hipster Beard Fois Gras and don forget to put your specially made rough hewed plaid napkin on your lap. Yea this hipster Hunting Lodge is full of itself and then some. Way to ruin traditional food. But hey, it hip to be faux every thing these days. But it could be worse, at least they didn put Revolutionary in front of Longman & Eagle. But something tells me that the owners went to the same high school and show up at the same family reunions as the brewery owners. Needless to say, I looking forward to trying the hotel I never thought I say this, but I miss the Winds Cafe.p.s. I added another star because our server was excellent', 'I have a headache this morning. I predicted my headache last night as I finished a big slug of moonshine.....WHAT? Moonshine. You know that a whiskey/bourbon/rye list is complete when it offers up Virginia Lightening. With the help of Jim at the bar, we turned our drink menu into more of a checklist. With $3 shots of whiskey you can do that. (we sipped them in a very refined way). Dinner was very good- I say that because we had already eaten Italian take out for dinner, but after smelling their kitchen for a good 30 minutes, we decided to put in our names in and go for late night round 2. Our server William was great and led us through a great eating experience- good recommendations, timing, and attentiveness. We also got a chance to chat with the kitchen staff which was great- they really take pride in their craft and were very friendly even after a long night of cooking- we stayed until after 1 and weren the last diners. My fave on the menu was the scallops- they were the best scallops that Ie had in Chicago- they were fresh and not overwhelmed by seasoning. We loved the apricot (?) that came with cheese plate. The ricotta gnudi (sp?) were light and delightful- I just wish they gave more....or I didn have to share! I wasn in love with the cauliflower but thought that for a big chunk of cauliflower, it was artfully prepared.I appreciated the wild west touches but didn necessarily like them for myself- from our meal the Wild Boar sandwich made from boar that are hunted to order and the oxtail with the scallops. Even the kobe meatballs had a flavor I couldn put my finger on.....I think youl either love that or hate that.Il definitely be going back to work on my checklist, have some more Rebel Yell and try a few more dishes- especially the seared tuna and the catfish. I wholeheartedly trust what they do with creatures from the sea. But I have to try to remember.....no moonshine or Charter 101 if its a week night! I would kill for a fried egg and a bloody mary right now.....', I hate to say it, but yes, I was disappointed. Maybe it was all the hype (Don't believe the hype ... name that tune!). Maybe it was where we sat. (In the corner next to a cold, windy door) Maybe I've been cooking too many fantastic meals at home. (haha!)Either way, I was unimpressed by the food here. We ordered the Kobe meatballs, Wild Boar sloppy joe, bone marrow dish and the duck egg and tongue dish. Oh, and the creme brulee at the end.First, the portions. TINY. Okay, let me preface this by saying that I do have some portion control problems. But still. There were like, 6 Kobe meatballs half the size of a golf ball. I was like, seriously? I know it's Logan Square but COME ON. Not everyone needs to squeeze into the skinniest jeans possible (I live in Logan Square so please don't throw tomatoes at my bad joke). The Wild Boar Sandwich was definitely appetizer size ... I could have eaten two on a bad day.And yes, I could have eaten two because that was the only thing I truly enjoyed at dinner. The bone marrow was, eh. The toast was burnt and the marrow just wasn't very good. The duck egg and tongue hash was pretty good ... but not blow-my-mind terrific.And, they were out of the yuzu hot toddy. Booooo. I was sort of wanted to ask, well, can't you just whip one up? Guess not ... We did have some whiskey shots though ... I guess that was good.All in all, unimpressed. Maybe Ciao will have better food., 'One star for the extensive whiskey menu, and the rockinbartender. Nothing more.I was excited to go here, not so much because of the hype (which I tend to ignore), but because of it proximity to our home, It right off our (Logan Square) train stop, so what a great spot to meet or just decompress on the way home.We went on Sunday hoping to avoid the crowds the first time around, and it worked. Sat at the bar, perused the long list of drinks and the short, concise list of Bar Snacks. Okay. Something to munch on would be nice, and the Welsh Rarebit served with pretzel sounded nice, but my companion is watching his fat intake (that cholesterol will getcha!). So we see about ordering 1 order of the dip and add on an extra pretzel...sounds pretty simple, right? I thought so too, guess I was wrong.I explained to our bartender what we wanted, and he put it in the system. A few minutes later a woman (who was acting in food runner and perhaps managerial capacity) came over to get clarification -- yes, I said, we want ONE order of the rarebit/dip, and an extra pretzel. She nods and turns around, we go back to our conversation...and then TWO rarebits arrive.Now, I can understand that it a fairly new place and perhaps not all the kinks are worked out, but it not *that* new, and is an additional pretzel really THAT complex to accomodate? We were brought two orders which we (a) didn need, (b) didn order and (c) weren that tasty. The dip was very heavy on mustard; the pretzel was lukewarm to cold. Getting charged ten bucks for two orders of what should have been a simple bar snack with a small adjustment, I not a fan of. We asked the bartender to mention in to management; he knew where we were coming from and apologized for it, but didn offer to take the additional charge off the bill.Maybe they should stick to serving liquids.', We called ahead for our table of 9 and were told to just come on in (instead of making a reservation on the phone) because there was another party of the same size a couple hours before us, and we could just stake out their table. Our whole party waited for more than two hours and, long after the previous party of 9 had left, the hostess said they lost that table and they could seat us at two tables that weren't close to each other. After standing around at the bar for TWO HOURS already, we said thanks but no thanks. Disappointed and starving, we ended up going to El Cid a couple doors down instead. Did I mention this was for my boyfriend's birthday? Edit: The FOH manager at Longman & Eagle reached out to me to talk about the situation and apologized profusely for the issues we had that night. Sometimes, shit just happens, and apparently that's what happened when we tried to go. No hard feelings anymore, and I'm definitely willing to try going there again. Upgrading my star rating for now to a mostly-neutral three stars until I get a chance to really try it., I came back again, with a date. This time I tried .... for my very first time, ESCARGOT. I actually like the texture. I did not, however like the taste. So I hear the traditional way to prepare escargot is with a LOT of butter and a LOT of garlic. Apparently this is to disguise the utter taste of dirt and sand flavor of snail. hahaI will definitely try escargot again, just not here. And not in a bordelaise -- I don't think that was the best sauce. We ordered the ricotta gnuddi with porcini marmalade and crispy sage. Mmmmmm. It reminded of a warm holiday with a twinge of sweetness there. My date and I tried the candied apple with butternut squash semifreddo, fresh chestnuts and salty caramel. He thought this sounded great and it's normally not something I would choose, but DAYAMN GINA. This was fucking amazing!! Pardon my language. It was definitely swoon worthy and the Alterra coffee was strong and delicious with it. You know, of course I'll be back here. It's a new favorite spot of mine. Really., Went here on my birthday with my husband. We had a great time. The amuse was something raw like tartare, so I gave it to my hubby, who enjoyed it. We ordered some starters, I had the warm bacon vinegarette salad with beets. It was decent but I guess I'm not a fan of warm thick dressings, I like them more noticeable and not so smoky. For entrees I had the sausages with kraut and the watercress salad (such a huge plate, I had to take some home!) My husband had the veal and loved it. Oh and we also split the oxtail with scallops-delish!! We will be back and love that this place is walking distance from our condo. Kudos to the owners and chef!!, Just wanted to add an addendum to my review and bump the star up a notch. I had been torn on how to review and I feel my 2 star rating was more a reflection on my unique dietary situation. That said, it may have been a little low. I will leave the 4 and 5 stars to people who are more qualified to judge wild boar sloppy joes and kobe meatballs. If I ate meat, I'm sure I'd love them!, 'this place is beautiful and bacon is in almost everything...i would give it 5 stars..but a few little things were off, foodwise. Service is awesome. the kind of negatives but not major:the pretzel was lacking...pretzel-ness if that makes sense.. the dough, to me, tasted more on the bread side than a pretzel?i had the goat cheese and beet salad, which i always love.. there was bacon in that too... and a little too much, it almost over powered the salad.i had the seared tuna with white beans. the tuna was a HUGE portion..but not too much else i can say about that, the white beans were really tasty (again with bacon) my friend had the pork belly and i had some, and that also was a large portion and really amazing.. next time i will go with that.', 'I would say a great place to be adventurous. I tried the the sweetbread (thymus) which tasted almost like a combination of chewy chicken breast and liver. Ie been meaning to try the roasted bone marrow at Volo, but glad I finally got to try it here. I also tried the kobe burger to fill up, but I have to say, it was the worst kobe burger I have in my life. The only thing I liked about the burger was the beautiful slabs of bacon. The star of the show was the wild boar sloppy joes. However, you should note my standards of sloppy joes are quite low. Ie had a $1 bake sale type sloppy joe and one that I made myself using Coca-Cola as the secret ingredient. But if you never had a sloppy joe from here, it simply tastes like meat ragu between buns.So there you go. Had a bipolar dining experience, in which some items were great, some horrible. But, I think Il keep this place more as a watering hole for some whiskey.', Don't forget to bring your mustache and wear you flannel shirt !! The staff definitley was quitesential 'hipster' though I don't know if I really know what that means.If your driving by looking for this place you will never find it ! Its is really a shabby looking building with the name only written on the window, the inside is super cute though.The menu is quite sophisticated and interesting but none of the entrees were really exciting me too much. A friend and I split a starter and a plate, the server told us they were small but I was still surprised !! We tried the meatball app, which was 3 golfball sized meatbalss in a little red sauce and mascapone maybe, and we also had a fried ricotta cheese dish, again it was beautiful, 5 little half golfball sized cheese bites. Both were good, but for $8 a piece I don't think I'll be trying them again. Great beer list, good service, and cute atmoshphere ( I loved the ceiling), though on the way out we saw a family with two really small children, odd, maybe the kids really like Maro or sweetbreads !!, My boyfriend and I went to L&E right after work on a Monday night and were seated immediately. The interior was warm and nostalgic and we were promptly greeted by our server. We were impressed with everything we ordered and appreciated the input of our server when we asked q's about the menu. I was also impressed with the amount of food coming out of such a tiny kitchen. It's true, the portions are on the small side, but I usually find that my eyes are bigger than my stomach. I don't like leaving a restaurant uncomfortably full...I do like leaving feeling like I tried something new and it was amazing. :), Went here with my friend a few weeks ago. We liked it. First of all, sort of like Freeman's or Dressler in NYC which made me happy. We didn't like the pretzel welsh warebit (like a cheese pate...odd texture). The Gnudo (fried cheese balls) were yummy. Also loved my pork belly entree, and my companion liked her tuna. It was reasonable priced (around $35 each) which I appreciated. Would return., '.sloppy joes - awesome flavor, little bit of kick.. delicious.housemade pork sausage - great texture, not oily at all, seasoned well, more akin to a big, supertasty kebab .burger - classic, default is with bacon (score).bourbon - good selection w. 1 or 2 oz pours...great service - was thanked no less than 3 times on teh way out the door not to mention a yelp email from the owner for taking the time to review.. overall, great, hearty gastropub fare at a good price.. bourbon selection seals the deal, ill be back for sure..', 'Finally made it across the street to Longman & Eagle. The set up is much the same as the previous tenant, the Four Winds but, where as Winds was very chill, this place is just too crowded for that adjective I will say the paint and decor certainly improved the place. For drinks we had beers and the Yuzu Toddy which was delicious, and all were pretty standard price wise. We also had the Kobe Meatballs and Welsh Rarebit . The balls were very rich so, the small portion size suited us perfectly - they really nailed this dish. My only complaint was from my sore bum from sitting on the backless, wooden seated stools at the bar - ouch! Felt like I was sitting on plywood!', Despite the fact that I interviewed here and didn't ever hear back (although I think it has to do with some extracurriculars not on my CV- such as hanging around 4am bars) Longman & Eagle is pretty much exactly what I'd want to do if I opened up a place. Only I wouldn't put so much balsamic on the olives. For real though, awesome menu that does a superb job mixing the accessible with the adventurous, great service, stunning interior, and encouraging ladies to have whiskey with dessert should be a much more wide spread practice. I do however wish they would take at least a limited numbers of reservations. Servers know how to turn tables--but I think people feel entitled to sit around after having finished a meal in direct correlation to how long they waited., Disappointment is the name of the game folks. This place has been trumped up by most everyone as the bees' knees, and since it's my neighborhood, I believed the hype. The menu is very adventurous, don't get me wrong, but the bouillabaisse I had was very bland. I didn't ding the place on serving sizes, but do go with a fat wallet or un-hungry. Come to think of it, the best thing I tasted that evening (I had snippets of food from my friends' microscopic plates of scallops) was the couscous muse (I hope they add that to the menu). Besides the food, I had a small issue with the service. 1) We waited 30-40 minutes for our food; mistakes happen, but a little communication between the staff and the diner would've saved the day on this one. 2) To make up for the wait, we were served complimentary whiskey after our meal; besides the fact that two of our party hadn't ordered drinks (one person in our party doesn't drink and the other was staying away from alcohol for personal reasons), how on Earth does whiskey satiate a hungry belly?! Despite all this, I still give the wait staff (that includes you water guys) their propers; their efforts to make the experience bearable were remarkable., 'I went with my friend, Mel, on a Wednesday night and the most adorable hostess in a jumper & tie seated us. The room is warm and inviting.Highlights--- the marinated olives, the scallops & braised beef was drool inducing fabulous, and the porkebelly had a good balance of sweet & fat. ;-) The MaryJane candies at the end of the meal made my night.Lowlights- the duck spread on little toasts felt like tuna fish salad and had little flavor. Also, our drinks took a really long time to come out to us. The bill was a bit pricey for the quantity of food (but not the quality.)I want to give 3.5 stars, but will go back to let them wow me again.'|1
28|lord-stanley-san-francisco|Ok , biased opinions to one side , I'm a Brit (it's run by a Brit ) I went on pre opening (always a bit risky for a review ) It was wonderful , food was great . Maybe a bit more salt needed , but basically great . I was the token Brit among locals , the salmon was great as was the English pea starter . The lamb needed a tiny bit longer slow roasting .but as I say pre opening is tough . The wine we had (I'm not sure this is all they had ) pairing was different . Maybe a stronger red needed .Anyway who am into discuss wines . I wish these lovely people all the best luck in the world and I will definitely recommend it to all my friends on their visits to the city ., 'Outstanding food in a fun, corner space. The English peas starter and the black cod with curry and avocado main course were particularly delicious. Best wishes to this new restaurant.', We loved our first meal at Lord Stanley. Most of the dishes had a clear British influence (which was one of the main reasons I was excited to come here), but the dishes were also modern and beautifully presented. All four of the savory courses I sampled were excellent: the salmon, charred leeks, black cod, and poached hen. For dessert, the 'Eton Mess' was a particularly unique take on the classic dessert, featuring similar flavors and textures (berries, cream, and meringue) with some unique twists. I'd happily return for the great food and service., I'm SO happy this place is finally open! I live 2 houses down from Lord Stanley and I have been waiting for it to open. Holy Cow this place is my new favorite! We started ONION PETALS AND SHERRY VINEGAR - this is the most unique and addictive thing I've ever had. Get this, it's a good $5 bucks spent. For two people I'd order two of these because you'll want more trust me. Next we got the ENGLISH PEAS, FRESH CURDS, CARROTS AND DILL. This was so fresh and light! Our last starter was the BEEF TARTAR WITH SEAWEED, CUCUMBER, AND NORI CRACKER. My fiancd9 LOVED this I like it, but the reason I say liked is because I'm just starting to appreciate beef tartar.For our entrees I ordered the POACHED HEN, RADISHES AND BARLEY, POULTRY JUS. Very flavorful! The only thing I wished was it didn't come with chicken thighs. They give you both the breast and thigh but I'm more of a breast person in general. My fiancd9 got the SLOW COOKED AND GRILLED LAMB SHOULDER, ALLIUMS AND LEMON and wow I wish I got that but next time!Remember this place includes tip in their menu already. I think that's such a wonderful idea.Go here! You won't be disappointed!, '#tl;dr Clean ambience x nice service, but have a 2nd place planned for afterward if you want a filling meal vs snacks.PRICES: Already include tip per European custom so #stoptrippin.PORTIONS: Lite bites over conversation with your friends. #setyourexpectationsFLAVORS: Overall light. I ate 5* dishes, but the only one sticking in my head is the onion app.SERVICE: Good. *Made their own gesture of reprising a dish they felt they under-executed. Wholly their idea, as I hadn said anything.DECOR: Clean, classy, tons of white everywhere - kind of like an apple store but for food. Bit of whimsy with the squiggly lamp wires.

Omakase $?Saw people arrange it with a host. #secretmenu## NERD WARNING ##!! You will gain nerd points if you read any further - so don !!DINNERWARE: I personally appreciated the choice of Bon Chef silverware accompanied by simply shaped glasses and basic plates.MENUS: The physical craftsmanship of the drinks menu was not up to par with the simple elegance of the rest of the experience. In-house letterpress was ok, paper thicknesses were ok. What got me was all the pages sliding around (and easily falling out) due to the style of binding. The oversized cover x small inner pages can work if the pages are put in place; or the cover height can be sized to match the inner pages. Just a few approaches.TYPOGRAPHY: I dug the translucent square sheet main menu, but... tbh this is too nerdy to get into, even in the forewarned nerd section. Just know I have an issue or two with the lettering.OVERALL: I wish good things for this place. Cheers!', Amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Okay so, British influenced cuisine, you would think it wouldn't be the most innovative thing, right? Wrong.This restaurant is a repurposed take-out thai restaurant that has been completely gutted and now is simple but so elegant and, quite frankly, a chic combination of modern-art inspired black and white--my favorite color scheme. Everything at this restaurant wowed the taste buds, starting with the house made sourdough bread and the house butter, a melty and flavorful explosion of melty butteryness that made the taste buds leap. The smoked salmon appetizer was also really amazing, paired with a delicious lemony cream, it left my friend scraping the plate for every last morsel. The onion petals were also very good--the onions were light but very flavorful and juicy, topped with a dollop of delicious cream that lingers in the mouth. The best appetizer though is by far the heirloom tomatoes. They were so fresh and juicy and topped with some shavings of a yummy mild cheese, but they are also served atop an amazing bread that reminded me of the taste of the breading one finds covering a corndog. Just delicious.The main course, some magical lamb creation was probably some of juiciest, most tender lamb I have ever had. Please try this!!For dessert I had the Chocolate pouch, some dark chocolate and fruit wrapped in a little crepe-like wrapper and tied together like a pouch with a little gummy string. It looks blatantly bizarre, but mark my words, its like a little birthday present. Take the server's dessert wine recommendation as well, its smoky, dark taste acts as the perfect foil to the richness of the chocolate.On the subject of service, everyone was super amicable and very helpful. Offering amazing suggestions on the menu and always one step ahead when we needed our water or wine glasses filled. Better yet, this European-style restaurants includes gratuities in the check so these amazing people actually get paid something like a living wage, go figure. So amazing food and perfect service....what are you waiting for? This place barely opened and is already bustling, give them a couple more months and I bet their walk-in spaces will be filled up all of the time. Good luck Lord Stanley and keep the amazingness going--I will be back soon!, Really wanted to love this place, but we were still starving, not 80% full, not 60% full, we were starving, after having 2 starters and 2 mains for two people. As another patron commented. This is a place for snacks, pricey snacks. $100 for us. We went home and grilled a big juicy steak!We had a 6:15pm reservation. The sun was still out. 80% of the tables were empty. We got seated in the sun. The sun went down by the time we finished. The lamb shoulder plate had 4 small pieces accompanied by onions. A dinner plate should have edible veggies, protein and carbs. This plate has no edible veggies or carbs. I had the black cod. It was a much better plate I feel. Avacado and fava beans are filling. I don't expect house of prime rib portions. (I think that place is disgusting.) but I expect decent volume, balanced plate. I'll have to report back to my foodie friends to skip this hyped place., Awesome new place that ups Polk Street's game. Focused but thoughtful menu, super high-quality ingredients, warm and attentive service, perfect for date night! Seasonal vegetarian tart was divine, as was the chocolate pouch dessert which was masterfully put together and not too sweet.Finally, we appreciated the European-style tipping, as in no tip expected and they mean it-- receipt had no tip line so decided to leave cash. How refreshing!, Exquisitely prepared dishes, each with enough distinction to separate them from the crowd of all the other carefully plated meals in this town. The marinated mussels surprised my senses - I never expected mollusks to taste that good. Best black cod I've had. The Eton Mess desert was the perfect finish to a great dining experience. Try the Loire Valley sparking wine!, A great renovation on the space makes it very inviting with a bright, clean look. My dinner partner and I had the perfect cured salmon with glazed yellow potato; Heirloom tomato on superb pan d'epies with black garlic tapenade; grilled lamb with four onions. Both bread and butter are house made. Two desserts, one chocolate pouch, the other fresh berries with meringue and ice cream (called Elon Mess). Minor gripe: We don't mind a $4 cup of good coffee but how about a refill that doesn't cost another $4? Just asking. It's no tipping policy should only catch on with other restaurants.. Service was on target. Oh, and complimentary wee truffles, always a lovely finishing touch. Go!, Not bad, although I lament losing the Thai place that used to be here. Not known to be a high dining destination, will be interesting to see if it can sustain the neighborhoods penchant for crispy tacos instead. Although the torchon at La Folie up the street reigns supreme for the area.We didn't sample the entire menu, but stick with the cod and avoid the lamb. Skip the peas starter, reminds me of David Chang's comment of lettuce on a plate, except peas in a soup. Should British fare just fall back to Indian instead? Exciting addition, but needs a little extra to make the trip to B&T (no, not the Broadway tunnel) corner worth it., The pickled mussels were delicious! Heirloom tomatoes, salmon starter and black cod entree. Fresh bread and butter. I'm still drooling from it all...Each course was fresh, bold and perfectly balanced. Ambiance was clean, crisp, modern and simply delightful. A great neighborhood gem and easily one of my favorite new restaurants.Must try!, 'Great experience - delicious food and impeccable service!! Made a reservation at after walking by and noticing the Thai place was gone. The space is small, so I would recommend a reservation. Beautiful/ minimalist interior - what a difference in design! When we arrived, they were running a bit behind schedule so we hung out at the bar and grabbed a drink. The host was friendly and continually checked in on us. After waiting about 10-15 minutes, they brought us a complimentary snack- the pickled mussels with dill - as apology, which was over and beyond what was necessary or what other restaurants do. This was our first introduction to the amazing food. The menu had a great variation of items. What we tried:Snack: Pickled mussels with dill: Must have!Starter: Gazpacho: Unique, but could have done withoutMains: Cod: Must have!Perfect for a date night - What a great addition to Polk Street!', My husband and I did the tasting menu, which I highly recommend if you're willing to splurge a little. Not a bad thing on that menu! Favorite item was the salt cod, which doesn't include potato in the description. However, the potato was a fabulous surprise! Think mash potatoes mixed with just the right amount of salt from the cod. So good! Also, the chicken wing with a creamy lemon sauce was exceptional! Succulent and tender. I've never had a piece of chicken melt in my mouth before! Finally, if you don't do the tasting menu, I recommend that you still start with the sea urchin puff. It's a savory cream puff that's so good, it's like having dessert first., Since having dinner at Lord Stanley earlier in the week I haven't been able to stop talking about how good it was. The food was amazing, such interesting, unique and delicious flavors, with great presentation. The services was excellent. I can't wait to go back.I'm so happy a new great restaurant with delicious food is on Polk st.My only wish is for them to get an espresso machine for an after dinner espresso., Run don't walk to Lord Stanley while you still can.The food, ambiance and service are all great.Not only were all the meals we ordered delicious but the owners definitely thought about the details.The decor and glasses,plates ...are chosen in an artistic way-nothing seems standard or haphazard.The care and creativity in the cooking is mirrored in the atmosphere.Dining here is a treat., Didn't live up to expectations but was worth trying. The first disappointment was that after making a reservation we were seated at a communal table upstairs. I would have though you'd get a table for 2 when making a reservation and the communal table would be for walk in.The onion pedals looked beautiful and were unique but nothing something I'd order again. The sea urchin puffs were the same.The prawns were good but we're pretty pricey. $15 for just one prawn.The tomato and bread appetizer was quite nice. The bread was sweet and the tomato was ripe and juicy.The hen was nice. It was tender though a tad small but elegantly plates. The accompanying sauce and veggies were nice.The wine selection was very interesting and pan-European. The chenin blanc was excellent.I respect the place for innovating in terms of atmosphere and food. People were fairly dressed up here. I did not feel like I was at the typical SF farm to table casual but upscale place. It did feel very modern European., I would love to be able to give them more than 5 stars. Food is amazing, service is wonderful and casual, the ambiance is relaxed. This restaurant is the perfect balance. We ordered the entire menu but, we couldn't eat the last dish, the pork shoulder..... So we'll have to go back. When you go you must have the salmon!!!! I know, you'll say.... Is just a salmon.... NO this is going to be the best salmon of your life. Hats of to this Chef and his team. Truly, you have one of the best restaurants in SF today., 'The best food I have eaten in San Francisco at great prices in a place with outstanding ambience served by efficient happy staff ... At last !at last !!', We had a very nice dinner here last Saturday. I had the foie gras, brioche a little stale but other than that I was very happy with it, followed by the hen (kinda small but boneless with a nice crust), charred lettuce a nice touch and really good mushrooms. Sampled the salmon starter and pork shoulder. Good but nothing particularly outstanding. Adored the strawberry Eton mess for dessert. Rounding up to 5 bc the server was wonderful, food came promptly and I like how the tip was included (although it makes the prices seem higher, they aren't)., 'I just left the restaurant after waiting almost an hour with a reservation. The host sat down everyone before us, even though we had a reservation.  Never got to sit down and we had to leave because its 10:40 at night. Would have loved to try the food. The people behind the bar were nice and the host was very rude. Thanks a lot!', Terrific, creative tasting menu. Novel, interesting wines. Nice cocktails, if only just a few to choose from. Down-to-earth and unpretentious. For the quality, reasonably priced. This place is going to be swarming soon. The wagyu beef was the one thing we didn't enjoy much, but would go back in a heartbeat., We live in the neighborhood and were excited to check this place out. Food is the highlight here, although the pace of the meal was a little slow. Most interested to see if the menu changes often or not, as I'd like to see what the chef can do beyond the current menu. Service was good, and once I realized the tip for the meal was already included, I felt better about the prices, which initially I thought were high. My wife and I both enjoyed what we ate and would go back, Lord Stanley is a nice addition to the neighborhood., 'The good Lord Stanley, the heir apparent to His Majesty Bauer kingdom as marked in the San Francisco Chronicle, was raised with a silver spoon in his mouth and a complete disregard for his loyal subjects.After arriving to the sauna that is Lord Stanley castle (because of course air condition has not arrived to this god-foresaken land), we were rudely told that they were running at least 15 minutes late by the court jester that is also the host. And the holier-than-thou tone that ridiculed our expectation to dine at a reasonable hour was made only worse by their lackluster choices of beverages to distract us from our wait. As a showing of generosity of the Lord Stanley, we were given scraps of their pickled clams and fennel, though upon consumption, was neither inventive nor impressive. Nor edible. After almost an hour and a half wait - we were allowed to sit, but as expected, we were quite ignored. Upon asking one of the denizens of the kingdom if there might be mayhaps someone to which we could place our order, she briskly said I can find our waitress and returned not but a long moment later with I can help. The food was thoroughly San Francisco - to wit, a bit inventive, but rather unnecessarily complex. The extensively-cooked salmon was delicious, but the potato was placed seemingly with little thought; the foie gras tartine was rich, but the picked strawberries and gelatin was overpowering; the poached cod was buttery and flaky, but the blistered avocado was a garnish at most. Thus to say, faire traveler, a visit to Lord Stanley is certainly not for the faint of heart, the empty of stomach, or any mere mortal. Perhaps consider other kingdoms or fiefdoms or hovels that know what they are doing.', I'm going to break this down for people. It is a new restaurant. With anything that is NEW there are going to be issues. I find it very standard for the issues to be in the wait-staff and seating times. I had a 8:45 PM reservation and was not seated until 9:15 PM. Yes, this is an issue, but I was willing to forgo since the hostess was very sweet and caring and brought us champagne. It is a small restaurant with a distinct Euro vibe... small and community centered with communal tables. This is not everyones cup of tea, but I loved it and finally felt like there was something that was unique in SF. The food was AMAZING. The hen cooked perfectly, and the flavors not masked by butter and fat. I always love the restaurants that get amazing reviews because people do not have a developed palate and what they think is a culinary experience is actually fat and no sense of flavors. Very clean and farm to table. Don't be in a rush to experience this restaurant, but rather think you are in Europe and go with it! Have a bootle of wine and relax. Enjoy, 'Most delish food and feels healthy. Love the unusual wines also. Worth a try or two or more.', 'So impressed with this place! Service was on point and every bite of every dish was perfectly executed and exciting. We got:pickled musselsfoie gras with the best brioche on the planetsalmon with potato (that potato....sous vide? something magical)pork shoulder with incredible brunoised appleWill be going back soon.', Lord Stanley recently opened and it's a European restaurant run by a wife and a husband. I really did how the environment was set up but I wasn't too crazy about the service and the food. All the appetizers that I ordered was very mediocre but my entree was actually pretty delicious. Maybe I will try it again but it wasn't my favorite. It looks like they tend to change the menu often as well. Things I ordered:- Pickled Mussels w/ Fennel and Dill (not much mussels but it wasn't bad) - Salmon w/ Yukon Potato, beurre blanc and sorrel- Foie Gras Confit w/ green strawberries, muscadet and warm brioche (not my favorite) - Pan Fried Seabass w/ peppers, black olive and bouillabaisse jus (best thing I ordered and super delicious), 'A delicious surprise.Expectations were exceeded by marvelous surprises in each dish as the expected texture and flavor was just the start of what was tasted.Girlfriend and I were pleased with the different wine selection, mostly the lesser know French and Italians.We were told the wine selection tries to focus on the terroir and representation of the soil. Not sure how much I agree with that but sounds good to me.Our snack was the chicken wing, cute and yummy. The lemon flavored sauce added a flavorful balance to the meaty moist chicken.The salmon starter was a highlight. I was prepared for sashimi experience based on the look but the texture was something that melts in your mouth. The salmon was cured, poached, and smoked. The soft yukon potato contrasted nicely with the buttery salmon.Our mains were the wagyu beef from the prefix and the pork shoulder. The restaurant was nice enough to let us order off the prefix and split it for us.The wagyu beef was a pleasant balance of fat and meat and cooked to the perfect medium rare, though we did not specify.The pork shoulder was lighter in flavor in contrast with the beef but wonderfully seasoned with sweet little onions and slightly charred green onion.We ended with the strawberry and elderflower and the chocolate mouse. The chocolate mouse was an unexpected presentation with thin pieces of chocolate rice crispy and layers of chocolate mouse. The strawberry elderflower was spoonfuls of refreshing icy sweetness.All in all this is a place to return to...!!', 'I want to keep this place a secret but thatl be hard, i know already :sob:Two blocks away from my apt, this cute little, modern classy restaurant popped up.It still pretty new so reservations aren hard to get - but I reading about some horror stories about waiting an hour+ even with reservation :/ not sure what that all about..I was super hung over and sleepy from day drinking before, and almost didn make it to the restaurant. Thank goodness for my sister for waking my ass up!I was way too full so we didn order too many things, but we ordered:Onion petalsSalmonBarbecued pork shoulderSmoked tea cream dessertSome breakfast beer thingThe onion petals were delightful to the mouth and the eyeballs. It went GREAT with the breakfast beer! The salmon was INCREDIBLE. Ohh that texture! The Sorrel with it had a refreshing, citrusy taste to it that went great with salmon and the cream.Dat PORK SHOULDER, doe.My sister took a bite and let out a... somewhat terrified gasp. I asked, What wrong?!?! :-o and she said,It... it so good.....I quickly took a bite, and let out the same sound. The pork was sous vide for 22hrs, and then flash barbecued afterwards. ermagerd. It was perfectly seasoned, and the accompanying veggies went great with pork. We cleaned our plates.Dessert was beautiful but ok - I think I might go for the Eton Mess next time for a lighter ending to the meal.The absolute delight was knowing that the prices included tax and tip. I almost tried to tip and I was like wait, there no tip line. AW YEEI was so happy with the experience, I made a reservation to come back again TOMORROW!CANNUT WAIT', Slow service, absolutely terrible food. The chicken wings were rubbery, the mushroom appetizer tasted flat and was less than one mushroom sliced. The summer squash was burnt in some places and mushy in others: inedible. The lamb was fatty. In the end we didn't like a single thing except for the butter and wine. It was really disappointing., Was so dissatisfied with the tasting menu. Small portions and some off- tasting dishes. Double date and we had such high hopes for this new establishment. The tasting menu was a roller coaster ride, quoting the dinning companions. Some hits like the pickled mussels and house ricotta/ squash and Waygu beef. But so many misses, the salt cod/ olive brioche and the dessert, Eton Mess. I would pass on these. We did do the foie supplement and it was just okay. Very very loud, difficult to have conversation. Service was good but food service is very slow. Small portions but I was stuffed by the end of the savory courses. Won't be rushing to come back at $100 pp., 'This place just opened up 2-3 months ago and I would highly recommend coming here as a small group or on a date. The ambiance gives off a modern european feel with all white tables, walls, furniture, etc. The service is amazing very prompt, clean, organized, friendly, and very informative about the menu. For small plates I would recommend the onion petals (SO GOOOD!) very unusual and the salmon with potatoes.For main entrees, you have to try the pork shoulder or the seabass. The pork shoulder has a very juicy flavor and has a little spice to it.I would highly recommend making a visit and great location on polk street.', 'The owners extended an invitation for us to return and promised to make amends for the unpleasant experience we had the last time. I do wish they had responded to my original email sent directly to the restaurant, but I am glad they read my Yelp review and reached out.Our second dining experience at Lord Stanley was a significant improvement over our first visit. The food was beautifully prepared and deliciously seasoned, the service was gracious, professional, and very attentive, and the ambiance was warm and inviting. We very much enjoyed our experience this time and we look forward to returning.One issue remains: Although, the restaurant was not as noisy during our second visit (thankfully, no nasty fights broke out this time), it was still fairly loud for an upscale dining establishment. And no, we do not want to eat in silence, and yes, we enjoy a lively environment, but we do not want to have to shout at each other to have a conversation during dinner. Something that can help mitigate noise issues is a trick I have seen used at some other restaurants where they put padding under the tables--it does not change their appearance from above, but it does help absorb sound.We are glad we took up the offer to return, and we will enjoy dining at Lord Stanley again.', Wonderful dishes, with perfect wine pairings. The dishes are so beautiful you almost don't want to eat them. The service is great as well, our wine glasses were refilled without asking. The overall design is thoughtful and intimate and modern., 'We waited too long for any of the food to come out. After the teeny tiny apps came out, our tiny entrees took about half an hour after that. Not only was the food sparse, the interior was sparse, not minimalistic chic, but more like ikea college dormish. Bottom line, the taste and portions were too small for the price. The food took too long, and at the very end, we were overcharged our bill by $113 which we had to point out. Overrated food, and very reckless service.', 'Excellent service, food - tasting menu was special. One of the best restaurants in town, and considering the price point - very reasonable for the quality of food.', 'Eh. Creative approach, but too many missed. A few misses: a cold butternut squash dish with too many competing flavors, a grilled pork shoulder with grilled onions resulted in a tough piece of meat with a somewhat slimy side. Halibut was good. Overall disappointing for a cute spot that I was hoping to like.', What is Lord Stanley: For those of you that have driven by the corner of Polk and Broadway Streets and wondered what's in the corner space with the gorgeous exterior facade and sleek modern interior, it's Lord Stanley. Lord Stanley opened in June of 2015, by husband and wife Rupert and Carrie Blease. They are the owners and co-Chefs with training from working throughout Europe and the US, most notably at Le Manoir aux Quat Saisons, Per Se, Blue Hill, Texture, L' Amphytrion, and locally at Central Kitchen and Commonwealth.What are Chef Rupert and Carrie cooking: Rupert and Carrie aim to bring influences from their travels and experiences to Lord Stanley, resulting in a menu that is simple, yet refined, with British and European influences. What is the food like: The menu reflects the seasons, highlighting the beauty and simplicity of local produce along with the finest, sustainably sourced ingredients. The dishes have a natural refinement, with aspects similar to Japanese cooking and influences from Europe and Britain. Everything is made in-house daily, including bread, butter, juices and infusions. In addition to the a la carte menu, there's a frequently changing tasting menu and the option to add a beverage pairing to every dish. Another interesting thing about the menu is that it includes tip simplifying the dining process for the guests. Why Lord Stanley and why am I suggesting you visit? For starters, the space both inside and out is gorgeous. It's hard not to fall in love with the simple yet modern luxurious decor. More importantly, Chef Rupert, Chef Carrie and their team bring a personal touch to the visit. What is the vibe: With the small intimate setting of 40 seats Lord Stanley evokes an intimate setting. So intimate that if you're lucky (as I was) one of the Chef's will deliver your dish to your table. It's little details like this along with the thought, love and attention that goes into each amazing dish which sets apart Lord Stanley. Their food is obviously incredible.Thanks for checking out my post I hope you enjoy dining with The JetSetting Fashionista. Emily, This place is a lot smaller than it looks in the pictures. The plating was impeccable. The food was pretty food. The service was pretty slow. And the damn door kept opening every 2 minutes and kept letting the freezing cold wind in.Things I would change; put some kind of drapes or something in front of the door so it's not so cold and uncomfortable every time someone comes in or leaves. Get rid of the handicap button by the door that everyone loves to lean on which also attributes to the door opening for no reason. And bring some damn water to your tables; busy? Fine bring a pitcher so you only have to do it once., I REALLY WANT to love this place... The service is fantastic, it's blocks from my house, it just got a Michelin star...but I don't. Why: Wine. The red wines are across the board underwhelming (love big chewy reds- they have sharp whiney reds).  Food. Nothing I've had there has really wowed me. The chicken & ribs seem to be their fixed menu items (on menu last night & also in July) but neither dish is very impressive. The fish was definitely more impressive than the meat, but still not knocking it out of the park. Maybe it's the dessert...?, 'When I heard a new restaurant had opened in my neighborhood and it was actually cute and stylish, I was over the moon. I usually only venture out on this block on weekdays since it overrun with drunken college grads on the weekends (not my scene).But Lord Stanley is bringing some serious class to Polk St. There are some reviews on here complaining of its starkness; are you kidding me? I a huge believer in the minimalist movement and the tall ceilings and white walls are so refreshing to me -- especially because theye properly accessorized with fur pelts and industrial pendant lighting.The menu apparently rotates on a regular basis but my party of 4 and I shared the following: Basket of complimentary bread = We asked for seconds, uff said. Onion petals = Remarkably unique and scrumptious bites of onion petals filled with cream (marscapone?) and soaked in sherry vinegar. Must-order for novelty alone. Chicken wings with orange sweet and sour = Tiny serving but we were expecting this since it was categorized under the SNACKS category. So tender and juicy... just wish we didn have to share it amongst 4 people! Foie gras with figs and warm brioche = Highly recommended -- even the Frenchman at our table gave his approval. Poached leeks with potato, buttermilk and truffle = The sauce was so good, we couldn stop sopping it up (with all that extra bread we requested). Barbecued pork shoulder with onions, apple and szechuan pepper = This had a vaguely Asian-European fusion flavor to me, probably because of the szechuan peppers. The pork was cooked perfectly. Chocolate mousse smoked tea cream and caramel = We were all blown away by the sophisticated flavors and the thoughtful balance between sweet and bitter. I not usually a fan of dessert but this was one worth ordering, and will leave you further in awe of the chef creativity and talents.All in all an incredible culinary experience -- one that left us all full, happy and inspired.', Our most experience at Lord Stanley was fantastic. The food was delicious - we ordered the onion petals; carrots with chamomile, bee pollen, and granola; pork shoulder; monkfish; and frozen yogurt with huckleberries and rose water. The food presentation was impeccable. We really enjoyed the Cab Franc. The service was outstanding. Overall, we enjoyed the vibe of the place. LS definitely lived up to its Michelin star rating. Plus, it's reasonably priced given that tax and gratuity are included., Oh how I wanted to love this place... Just blocks from home, with rave reviews, I thought this place must be great-- I left underwhelmed. Background: European restaurant, small intimate setting, clean modern decor with a touch of warmth. The menu changes weekly, and tip is included per European customs. The dishes have a foodie feel- think Commonwealth and Central Kitchen.I wasn't crazy about the rather large communal table upstairs, nor the slow service. The food was good, but nothing unforgettable. Red wines by the glass are youthful, aged 2013 +. I wish I could say more positive things about Lord Stanley, really wanted to love it., 'Reflections on the night from my four dinner companions:Delightfully nuanced.If I could regurgitate it to my baby bird friends I would.This was the perfect table for 5.Uplifting and pleasurable.Thoughtful service.Frisky and intimate.', Location, location, location. I really like Lord Stanley's location. Once you are seated you can look out at the rush of people drifting by the intersection of Broadway and Polk St. Service, service, service. The service is very good and very enthusiastic about what they bring to the table. For good reason. Money, money, money. Their pricing includes the gratuity, which makes what you pay to eat at Lord Stanley an incredible bargain. I started my meal with onion petals, which came with a sauce soubise, I think. This was a nice if somewhat unexciting small plate of food. However, you should not pay my opinion much mind. I started to eat the brown bits beneath the onion petals until recognizing that these were ornamental wood chips!Young carrots with curds, bee pollen and granola was a minor disappointment to me. The plating was beautiful but the carrots, lovely looking as they were, were a bit pallid. So this was an OK substitute for my usual salad.But the roasted hen redeemed everything. The meat was moist and tasty. Wonderful. The hen came with a perfect mash of potatoes, hazelnuts, and chanterelle mushrooms. Lovely, lovely, lovely.You are not going to get a better meal in San Francisco for just a bit over the 50 dollars tax and gratuity included that I paid. Get over to Lord Stanley., I love this place. I've been here twice and each time is a completely unique experience. The menu changes often and always has an interesting mix of flavors., 'Was just talking to someone about LS and forgot that I never did a yelp review. I really enjoyed the tasting brunch and look forward to going back for dinner. Love the interior. The owners, waitstaff and hostess were both kind and professional. Nice addition to Polk Street', Dinner was fantastic. We had all the snacks on the menu, a squid starter and two mains. The squid starter blew my mind. It came with a dashi that was just packed with flavor. I should have ordered two. The snacks were interesting but pales compared to the rest of the meal. Out of the three snacks (onion petals, chicken wings and salted cod beignets), the salted cod beignets were the best. The housemade tarter sauce was really good. As for entrees, we had the hen and monkfish. Both were perfectly cooked and flavorful. At the end we had the chocolate chiboust and poached pear. They were both good but the chocolate chiboust edged out the pear slightly for my taste.We didn't have alcohol but we did order house sodas. The one they had that day was cucumber citrus. It was on the savory side. We didn't really like it and they offered to make something different for us. The one the made was pomegranate blueberry lime. It was great.You don't have to tip here but service was excellent. No valet service. Street parking wasn't easy but we were lucky after going around the block a few times we were able to get a space.I'm already planning my next trip back., My wife and I are fans of 1760 and saw a recent review claiming Lord Stanley was better. They aren't, but they aren't bad either. I had the pork shoulder and it was not flavorful and seemed tough. Cheap cut of meat. My wife had the monkfish and at the halfway point we traded and I went from a three star rating to five stars ( hence the average. Four stars). The monkfish was terrific and that's a hard one to get rightService was excellent but slightly impersonal. Surprised me because there is a no tip policy. I like knowing the waiter is pleasant for reasons other than a tip. Wine list was mostly wines I had never heard of,but we were thrilled with our bottle which was inexpensive but fabulous. We started with the onion petals. Do not forget to order these. Price was reasonable for a pretty good restaurant ( one terrific entree and one so-so). I'll try them again. Maybe I just got unlucky on the pork., Had a wonderful meal here tonight with my husband and 2 friends. Everything we had was sooooo well executed and just cooked to perfection. There was almost nothing I could have pointed to, to improve upon.We all got the prix fixe and each course was delicious yet quite unusual. I tasted some combinations I've never had or would have thought would work, and it was all very playful and delightful. The scallop had a nice dark seared crust and medium rare center. It crushed the scallops I've had at Gary Danko. Another thing to note is how well developed the flavors are - intense yet light at the same time. They make great use of acid in the dishes and many of the broths had a nice tang to them. I haven't had a meal this great since I went to Californios nearly 9 months ago. The food here is not for the conservative eater, as they really like to experiment here. The wine was also really fun and unique as well., I loved this place. The setting was awesome, as was the food. We ordered the cod beignets, the skate fish, the duck and the chocolate chiboust. They were all amazing. This place is european and the tips are already built into their prices so they don't expect you to tip., 'I still thinking about my last dinner at Lord Stanley at the beginning of the month. Staring at the photos (I not much of a snapper but I knew THIS was one to remember,) reminiscing about it like a long-lost lover. Took a friend for his birthday, told him to choose a restaurant, any restaurant. I was surprised at the location, smack dab in the middle of the busy part of Polk. What we experienced that night was near-perfection.You know when you spend a pretty penny, and have not a shred of regret because the entire experience just made it worth every single one of those pennies? Well, this was it. From the second we were seated, to when we departed. First of all, can we discuss the service? We had a young Asian gentleman, definitely younger than us...and, wow. I told him it was impressive how him describing the dishes was akin to poetry, to which he laughed yes, he is very well-versed with the menu. We could tell. It certainly says a lot when you can trust that your server really knows what he talking about. He seemed to run the entire floor himself, with others to support. As our wine glasses depleted, another man brought the wine list in anticipation of our next order. We were constantly checked on. Everything was perfectly coursed. Just...impressive.We had 2 of everything in each section of the menu. Salt cod beignets and chicken wings were delectable bites to start a meal that was perfectly coursed. Entrees were hen (served boneless) and halibut which were delicious, with so many nuances to every bite. Even something that seemed like a simple choice, i.e. side of carrots were so unique and enjoyable, each bite a flavor explosion. And can we talk about that chocolate chiboust with sourdough ice cream and cocoa crumble. I can even describe what that means, but Ie never had anything like it. Wow. That all.I only found out afterwards that Lord Stanley recently earned a Michelin star. Rightly so. So impressed, can wait to be back, this is how a restaurant experience should be like.(P.S. Service is included in the price. With several glasses of wine, our meal was about $200 all inclusive. I was stunned. Ie spent significantly more, regularly, on mediocre meals...)', 'Came by recently and am not a fan of the current menu. Flavors not anywhere near as interesting as when I came when they first opened.SALT COD BEIGNETS WITH TARTAR SAUCE - sounds more interesting than it actually taste.POMME PUREE WITH HAZELNUTS AND GRILLED CHANTERELLES - boring. basically like a mash with a lot of goo. flavors were heavy handed and not at all interesting.ROASTED DUCK WITH ORANGE JUS AND CHICORY - protein was cooked nicely but again, flavors fell flat', 1. The FOOD: you MUST order the chicken wings!! #Legendary. We tried the Tasting Menu & everything in there is outstanding. The sauces are on the citrus-y / a tad sour side, so just be mindful of that. 2. The WINE: We had the Chilean wine, Piped1o & we are blown away!!! LOVE IT!!! It truly matches the Tasting Menu!! 3. The SERVICE: Superb!!! The staff are friendly & attentive. The guy with tattoo on his arms is hot, TBH. 4. Extras: they make their own butter & bake their own bread! Both are yummy we asked for a second helping! Truly deserving of the Michelin star!!! Keep up the great work! Oh btw, TIPS ARE NOT REQUIRED OR EXPECTED!!! Feels like I'm in Asia or Europe :), 'As a Stanley, I had to go to Lord Stanley! It was my birthday and I loved telling everyone my birthday plans were Lord Stanley and seeing the questioning looks in their faces.Atmosphere: Modern, European, chic but loud. It a small place so be prepared to talk over everyone to be heard by your dining companions.Food: Extremely interesting. This is not a place to go if youe not adventurous or not willing to try unusual combinations of flavors. We had the testing menu and the standouts for me were the scallop (great crust) and the chocolate dessert. To echo many of the reviews here, every dish had an interesting play on flavors. A lot of them had strong acid notes which offset the creams and proteins. Other dishes, the wagu and the salsify, had bitter notes to them but not off-putting.Service: Attentive, prompt. What you expect for a small SF restaurant on the upper end.Price: We ended up around $230 for two tastings, two drinks and two coffees (four barrel). Really enjoy that gratuity is included.Misses: It was loud for me. The wine list didn have enough wines by glasses as the ones they did have were primarily blends, good selection by bottle but didn want to finish a bottle on a weeknight. The wagu in the tasting menu was slightly tough and a little on the rare side; given the large portion they should have asked for cook preferences.I definitely go again when their menu changes.', Writing this review because our server Heather was awesome! Her vibe was very welcoming and she was friendly and attentive during our dinner.We ordered the tasting menu and the scallops were probably my favorite dish of the night. The vadouvan curry broth was light and subtle and I liked the coastal herbs that accompanied the dish. The roasted hen was also a winner. I loved the pairing with the chestnut light broth. The skin was scored and seared to crispy perfection.There was also a persimmon dish that was great, with smoked trout that was minced up and served with creme fraiche in the hollowed out fruit. Very refreshing and great way to start off the meal.The flavors of the grilled wagyu dish was delicious with the sunchokes and black garlic, but the steak was a little overdone for my plate. It was presented in a long strip instead of the how I see it on other reviewers pictures, so maybe that attributed to the middle being less pink. The flavor profiles of many dishes tend to be more delicate so don't expect to be blown away with bold flavors.Loved the clean, minimalist decor of the space, too!Overall, great service, interesting picture-worthy food/space., Summary: tiny little space with strong minimalist / Scandinavian decor serving decent food and okay wine that doesn't live up to the gorgeous ambiance; BUT REALLY GOOD BREAD!Every year, I look forward to where my husband's office will celebrate their end-of-the-year holiday party, since it usually involves a swanky restaurant, superb tasting menu, and tasty beverages. Basically, it's an evening once a year when I get to dress up and pretend like I'm a 1%-er in SF. This year's soiree was held at Lord Stanley, which was exclusively rented out for the evening.Before I received my holiday party invitation, I had never heard of this restaurant. Turns out, it's a teeny tiny place. Our tasting menu dinner was set-up for all 20 guests to be seated at one long table together, but I can't imagine the entire restaurant being able to host more than... 40? There's a small upstairs balcony/loft area that we did not use, but overall, this is a very small and intimate restaurant. The design of the space is modern with crisp lines, mostly bare white walls, and an aesthetic overall that feels minimal and Scandinavian? I enjoyed the cozy feel, but it felt like the ambiance and design was far better than the food and wine.First, kudos to the staff for incorporating unexpected ingredients and flavors in creative arrangements. From the hors d'eouvres, the onion petal and chicken wing were both very creative and quite tasty. Overall, we felt like the flavors in each dish were more subtle and muted than our personal preferences, but the onion petal was very unique with a fresh / sour profile and the chicken had crisp skin with a juicy interior. The salt cod beignet (squid ink colored the outer dough black) looked cool, but didn't taste like much. We were served two mixed drinks: one a champagne cocktail and the other a whiskey cocktail. My sip of the latter was really disappointing... perhaps the drink was made too far in advance of our arrival, because it basically tasted like water. Maybe the ice had melted too much? The champagne cocktail was much better.We sat down to begin the dinner service. And then, the bread. SO GOOD. A crusty loaf with soft chewy inside and a smoky / toasted outside. Swipe on some cultured butter and BAM: the best part of my night. Seriously. That good (for the bread) and that meh (on the rest of the food). Mushroom churros were a fun idea, but didn't taste very mushroom-y. Hen egg ravioli with greens reminded me of a giant dumpling, but have to admit I wasn't a huge fan of the undercooked egg in this dish. The ravioli's pasta wrapper and greens were excellent however. Foie gras and brioche highlighted that whoever is making Lord Stanley's bread is a culinary superstar and that apparently, I don't like foie gras cold or room temp. Scallops with coastal herbs and curry were in my few favorites of the evening. Pork shoulder entree was probably my favorite of the night: execution of the sear and perfect amount of cooking was excellent. Ended the night with an apple sorbet with cidre, followed by a chocolate cake with a chocolate caramel wafer/crisp and sourdough ice cream and what tasted like coffee granules. The last dessert had way too many textures and ideas going on: warm gooey cake with cold creamy ice cream with crisp caramel wafer AND crackling crunchy coffee crumbs? Just take out the last ingredient, and this could have been really amazing... the sourdough ice cream was a surprising but complementary partner to the chocolate cake. I think I'm forgetting some courses, but it just means they were not memorable.Also, the wine. Sigh. I don't drink a lot of wine, so when I have the opportunity to enjoy wine pairings with a tasting menu, I look forward to trying a variety of varietals and flavors. The sparkling Riesling was excellent: fruity, sweet but not cloying, bubbly, interesting. The rest of the wine was very forgettable. I brought home my tasting menu with wine pairings listed, and I'm not very inclined to look back on any of the wines other than the Riesling. Especially the sherry served with the final dessert. Tasted like wine-flavored syrup. Finally, this place is LOUD. Yes, we had a group of people enjoying food and wine and having a good time, but if we're one party and can barely hear our neighbors, how does anyone enjoy a dinner date here on a normal evening? Surely, some sound padding could be discreetly placed throughout the facility. I think there are many SF restaurants that have this problem as well. Also, we began dinner service at 7:30 and were served our last course at 10:30. Is this normal? I think part of this was that it would take 5-10 minutes on every course from when the first person was served their dish until the last member of our group received their dish. 10 minutes * 6+ courses = an hour of just watching servers walk back and forth from our table to the kitchen, Came here for my company's holiday party on 12/9. We rented out the entire restaurant for a 8 course meal prepared for 20 people. Before serving our meal, they've prepared some delicious hors d'eouvres including an onion petal, boneless chicken wings, and salt cod beignet. These were excellent (5/5), with a huge emphasis on the chicken wings. The other courses went as followed below:House bread and cultured bread - 5/51. Mushroom churros with creme fraiche - 4/52. Charred butternut squash, sorrel, and almond 3/5 - a bit too sour3. Confit foei gras with walnut, quince, and house brioche 4/54. Hen egg ravioli, poultry jus - 5/5 - by far the best dish of the night5. Scallops with coastal herbs and curry - 4/56. Grilled pork shoulder with turnips and licorice - 5/57. Apple Sorbet with Cidre De Normandie - 4/58. Chocolate chiboust with cocoa crumble and sourdough ice cream - 5/5 BEST dessertWine parings corresponding to the numbers above1.

Herve Villemade La Bodice Loire Valley, France 2012 6. Fanny Sabre Pommard Burgundy, France 2013Great ambiance and food - would definitely come here again!, 'When Lord Stanley opened over the summer, the first thing that came to mind was THE Lord, not to mention what a weird name for a restaurant. I no bible thumper and haven been to church since the 8th grade so when I speak of THE Lord, I mean THE Lord Disick. I seriously thought Scott Disick was now a SF restaurateur. They sure named their restaurant the way Kimye name their children. Ones is an airline competitor and the other a hospital. Poor babies.Until Lord Stanley was recently awarded their first Michelin star this past October, I didn have much interest in dining there. Only 4 months of being open, they received their star so they must be doing something spectacular! So I thought. Sadly, my friends and I left THE Lord disappointed and completely baffled as to how they received a star. The New American Menu is small with 3 snacks ($5-$7), 4 starters ($15-$24), 5 mains ($24-$78), and 4 desserts ($9-$11). Portions are small so order from each section. A 7-course tasting menu is available for $78. Service is NO longer included in their prices which we awkwardly found out later. ~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~Collectively, the execution was very uneven and some ingredients were not listed on the menu so those with food allergies beware (they didn ask if we had any). My friend who is lactose intolerant had to switch her entree with her husband because they presented her dish as being prepared with buttermilk which was not listed on the menu.*Onion Petals ($5) - 3 STARSbit.ly/1mweuXTPretty to look at but these tasted like a glorified onion dip. *Chicken Wings w/ orange sweet & sour sauce (2 for $5) - 3 STARSbit.ly/1O3JHfzThe boneless wing was crisp and tender but the sauce tasted funky. Call me ratchet but I prefer Panda Expressorange chicken.*Salt Cod Beignets w/ tartar sauce (2 for $7) - 4 STARSbit.ly/1OhJYqQBest dish of the night! Forget that they look like a pair of turds, the beignet was delicately crisp, fluffy, and filled with minced cod. Fish clouds!*Foie Gras Confit w/ quince, walnut, warm brioche ($24) - 3 STARSbit.ly/1PglHEVI order foie gras every time I see it on the menu. The foie gras torchon here was standard. The quince was mute in flavor so there was no tartness or sweetness to cut through all that richness.*BBQ Pork Shoulder w/ turnips, licorice, burnt apple ($27) - 2 STARSbit.ly/1IkceNBJekyll and Hyde on a plate. One piece of pork was well marbled and nicely tender while the other was so burnt and tough (see pic) that it left streaks of ashes as I sliced it. The supposed burnt apple had no color but the turnip was also burnt. I like char but this was covered in crust of ash. *Poached Apple w/ vanilla cream, verjus ($9) - 2 STARSbit.ly/1PjAh0dMaybe it was my fault for ordering such a boring dessert but it hard to mess up something simple like a poached fruit right? The apple wasn fork tender and had to be cut with a knife (with sawing motion). The poaching liquid infused a very unappetizing flavor into the apple. My friend took a bite and said, it tasted like meat. ~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~We had two female servers who were really polite but I felt service was lacking refinement. Our water carafe was empty and 3 different people passed by on several occasions and just looked at it. Once asked, they were quick to refill it though. Dinner ended awkwardly and on a bad note. When settling the bill, we reconfirmed with one of the servers that the service charge was included in the menu prices. She said, Yes, no tip is necessary. After signing the bill and before leaving, a tall man comes to our table and said, As of early this week, gratuity is not included in the menu prices....His cold demeanor, tone, and choice of words made us feel like we purposely stiffed them on the tip. Inside, I was horrified and embarrassed. I don care how bad the food is, I would never NOT tip because I know servers survive on tips. Now, had he nicely said, Hey guys, I sorry if there was a misunderstanding but we recently changed our tipping policy..., we would of been fine. But, he didn. I hope they have trained all their staff on the new policy to prevent future embarrassing mishaps for others.~ * ~ A M B I A N C E ~ * ~I all for minimalist decor but Lord Stanley is stark, sterile, and the Ikea-like furnishings made the dining area look like it was on clearance. It a small restaurant with 5-6 two tops, 2 four tops, and a communal table in the mezzanine. Even after requesting a table in the notes section in opentable, we were seated in the communal table. This turned out fine as we were the only ones there aside from a couple and it was much quieter upstairs. ~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~No valet or nearby parking lot. Good luck! Luckily, the delicious parting chocolate caramel truffles (bit.ly/22kJvyF) somewhat washed away the bad taste in my mouth. Now, those are some Michelin star worthy truffles!'|1
29|luce-san-francisco|'Pronounced Loo-Chay, the 130 seat restaurant in the new Intercontinental Hotel, focusing on California meets Italian fare. The restaurant space takes a good portion of the first floor of the hotel, making good use of the ubiquitous glass walls of the hotel. As you walk into the lobby, Bar 888 and their lounge area is to the right while the impressive wine case, kitchen and dining area to the left. The interior design elements are very modern and also utilize a lot of glass. The chandeliers are huge tinted glass globes that contain the lights in the center, there a huge chandelier with football shaped disco balls, and the rest of the lighting is inset track. The floor is beautiful hardwood, with those wooden accents and pale silver cloth for the drapes. The dining room is quite spacious with a very open feel from the vaulted ceiling.We had heard that Bar888 was going to be big into Grappa, so I had the waitress ask the bar staff to surprise me in addition to the French 75 ordered. She later arrived with a cocktail that featured two grappas, one blueberry infused and the other honey, with lime juice and fresh blueberries afloat. Delicious. After getting a good look at the menu, we focused our night with:- Big Eye Tuna Tartare with Avocado Mousse and Crispy Shallots- Ocean/Land Carpaccio with Black Olive Ice Cream and Sauce Vierge- Scallops with Cauliflower Puree, Tangerine Salad and Bacon Twists- Monkfish Sous Vide, Truffle Essence, Baby Vegetables, Spring Onion Soubise, Beet Vinaigrette- Tangerine/Polenta Upside Down Cakes with Tangerine SorbetThe tartare plate was surprisingly plentiful with super fresh tuna topped with a quail egg. The Ocean/Land was a huge surprise with it being a charcuterie style salume wrapped around a seafood mousse and then sliced into quarter sized slices. Two slices were then used to sandwich the black olive ice cream. Both taste and texture were really unique. Might be strange for some but I found it super tasty and very intriguing. The scallops were lightly seared and still rare which sat better with one of us than the other (yes I like rare scallops) and came with these crazy bacon twists for the saltiness. The monkfish paired with the soubise, beet vinaigrette and truffle essence gave you three different tastes, with the monkfish being very tender via the sous vide. Finally, the tangerine cakes were mini versions that were not too sweet, providing a nice citrus tart contrast to finish off the meal. We noticed when eating here that there were a lot, I mean A LOT, of business types. Almost every man was wearing a suit/tie and most of the women were fairly decked out too. I guess that not too surprising considering the hotel is positioned for many of the conferences that are at nearby Moscone. It turns out however that we were seated right next to the executive operations team for the Intercontinental Hotels Group. So as we dined, we got to chat with the VP of Ops North America, the SF General Manager, among others and they even brought over chef Dominique Crenn herself. Lots of insight on the hotel, the restaurant, and the upcoming introductions to the menu. A wonderfully nice group of people celebrating their grand opening. The staff on top of that are super attentive and are there for your every need. If you watch closely youl see the floor managers keeping a watchful eye, sending servers and bussers as needed to each table. I looking forward to the future tasting menus and two items which require 24 hour notice: Salt Baked Whole Sea Bass and Prime Aged Cote de Boeuf. I definitely coming back to the menu multiple tries, especially given the warm hospitality of the entire staff.', Yay, I get to write the 1st actual review. Last night my fiance and started the night at the Bar I believe it's called 888 in the new intercontinental hotel. We then proceeded to dinner at Luce. Wine selection was amazing, service was impeccable. Our server Maria was great, she even got me food from the bar menu. We started out with the tuna tar tare, which was delectable and wonderfully seasoned. My fiance had the pork belly, which literally melted in your mouth. I actually went for the burger from the bar menu, just one of those nights. Very nicely done, with tasty seasoned steak fries.We don't normally go to Hotel restaurants, but we will definitely be going back to Luce., 'Technically a 3 star experience but an extra star for their efforts as I will tell you later.So after a not-so-great experience at the bar, we embarked on our dinner hoping to salvage my b-day celebration night. Our waitress, Jourdan, was very courteous, helpful, and exemplified the service fitting of a 4-star restaurant. We told her we were a bit delayed b/c of our issue at the bar. She seemed genuinely empathetic and was very nice. Well, on to dinner...I started with their hearts of romaine which was described like it was a caeser salad but the dressing was more of a lemony vinaigrette with parmesan cheese shavings and a slice of anchovie...hmmm...ok. My entree was a grilled venison (I love game meats). The venison was cooked perfectly with a nice red center. Flavor-wise, it was a lil bland but was good. For dessert I took our waitress recommendation and tried their study of chocolate. Can remember exactly how to describe the 5 different ways chocolate was prepared but it was GOOD! I highly recommend this dessert if only to just come here for dessert alone!At the end of the meal, our waitress Jourdan, actually made a valiant effort to rectify our bad experience at the bar earlier by compng our dessert. Thank you Jourdan! The extra star is for you! One last kink that I caught was on our bill in which our salad and one of the entree was charged differently than the price on the menu (charged more than the actual price). I pointed this out and Jourdan quickly fixed it and appreciated that we pointed that out so they can fix it in their computer.Again, I understand that there are kinks that need to be worked out over the course of a grand opening and I hope the Intercontinental hotel find all the kinks and fix them over the next few weeks to months as I do want them to succeed and offer world-class dining and entertainment in my hood! Will check back in a few months to do a re-eval!', 'Get your fancy-pants on and head over to Luce for an incredibly decadent display of decorative delicacy. Mind yourself, you should prepare yourself for heavy breathing, lustful indulgence, and a possible change of britches when you wrap your mouth around that first bite of perfectly crafted, melt-in-your-mouth Large Scallops: served with red lentils, cauliflower puree, tangerine salad, and perfectly crisped bacon tortellini (ie the most perfectly crisped piece of bacon Ie ever eaten, which in fact I dreamt about later that night).Oh, and by the way, the Fish Cacciucco will make you cry.Bring only the finest date here. Please don waste a meal this good on your uncle Stew, your friend from pottery class, or a first date I sorry but it true. This meal must be enjoyed with the utmost awareness and intensity as it will likely be followed up with an insatiable urge to remove your clothing. Caution should be exercised when sampling anything at Luce, a true gem in upscale San Franciscan culinary culture.When I return for another round, once I get over the ongoing high I still riding--a couple months, maybe--I will jump head first into the Monkfish sous vide. Complete with succulent baby vegetables my date and I had on the side with our main courses, it expected to be the culmination of another intoxicating carnival of carnal cuisine.', 'Table 63.....that the best seat in the house!!! This place was quite a nice surprise....walking into the restaurant had a nice feel to it....bright and spacious. So even if ppl are talking loudly, it doesn really distract you.I really enjoyed their farro/onion soup. It kind of creamy but it had a wonderful sweet flavor from the onions.The crab with radish ravioli is very good too and has a pretty presentation. Bare in mind there is no pasta involved when they say ravioli. They take thinly sliced radishes and sandwich them together with a fresh crab filling. a must-try!!Cheers!!', i am torn about the three stars here and hopefully they will work out the kinks. first, the restaurant is nice looking but stark. our server was very sweet but completely untrained. luckily, the food we ordered was very good, especially for a lunch. i would like to try it again but don't feel compelled to rush back., It's only been open for 4 weeks, but I couldn't find one problem with the service, food, or atmosphere at Luce. I started with a beautiful beet salad...the flavor combinations were perfect. Next, I had the black cod, which came with Israeli couscous and baby vegetables. So fantastic. To finish up, we had a fantastic cheese plate.We just loved everything...I'll definitely be back!, 5 stars for food.3/4 for atmosphere.It's basically a lonnng extension of the hotel lobby.The design is cool but a little stark. Okay.The food though, mmm. The scallop dish did it for me. 6 massive scallops cooked perfectly, 3 with chopped scallop ceviche and caviar on top and 3 with bacon twirls. Down the middle of the plate was some farm-fresh greens with citrus. And some cauliflower puree. Fkn delicious.The beet salad was also really good, and actually everything has some sort of twist and is beautifully presented. The cod comes on Israeli couscous 'dyed' red from beets. Really pretty.And they name all our great farmers on the menu. It's fresh and local.Great service. The grappa menu is very....very...educational. If you're going to drink the kerosene, may as well understand it., 'sorry to be rude but whoever says anything positive about this restaurant is either smoking something or paid to do so. it was an utterly disastrous experience strewn with mishap after mishap. drinks:we try to order a glass of NZ type sauv blanc but they didn have one, our server suggested the CA one but we didn want to chance the occasional SB that been oaked and chardonnay-ized. we asked for an albarino and she said there wasn one, but she could suggest a riesling. suffice it to say that she wasn really listening to the type of white wine we were after, but alas, there wasn a sommelier etiher. so we decided on something safe -- a local sparkling. first one she brought was completely flat, flat as in not even a bubble struggling to be in sight. second glass she brought over was from a half poured bottle. does luce just have multiple of 1/2 to 1/4 filled bubblies lying around?then the bottle of wine. we first ordered a valpolicella which upon opening, reaked of a sulfur dump. and the odor did not go away, it was just wine that gone bad. we sent it back and ordered something that was from napa and has to be relatively safe for the most part. ok, they ran out. they offered a much more expensive alternative and didn offer it at the price of the first one, which is only the professional thing to do. we picked something else as we didn want to spend much more than then original budget, and it took her probably 20 mins to get it. THAT wine was off too. i strongly believe there is something wrong with their storage but when asked where they store their wines, all she would mutter was somewhere very far. for the most part, all their wines (white and red) are just way too warm. ok, again -- how can a place that labels itself as a wine restaurant not have a sommelier and servers who seem to be utterly clueless about the cellar??food:we at least were looking forward to the food as the menu was super enticing and we had spent the afternoon debating what to get. highsight would tell not to bother but it was truly a difficult decision at that time. between the three of us, we had the carpaccio, tuna tarare, beet salad, venison, black cod, and scallops. i not even going to go into details but i couldn taste what fish / meat constituted the carpaccio, the cod might as well have been frozen from TJ, baked, then roughly doused in salt and pepper. there was absolutely zero flavor. presentation was so amateurish you think an 8 year old put it together to impress mom on mothersday. ingredients didn enhance and flavors didnt meld, and that foam business is just oh so 10 years ago. bottom line -- it was a ridiculous meal at a place that exudes and air of surperiority that it far from deserve. it tries too hard, doesn even realize its shortfalls, and has no experience staff on hand. youl have to pay me to go there again.and what up with the table cloths? they look like theye stayed in the dryer for 2 days and obviously not been ironed. they are so wrinkled they look like tissue paper that been unwrapped from a gift!', 'This is my first review on Yelp although Ie been a user for some time. I felt compelled to write as my experience at Luce couldn have been farther from that of the one The L wrote about a few days ago. L must have been at a different restaurant - in fact it is possible as they wrote in their review that they asked where the wine is stored and there is a huge visible wine storage rack in the middle of the restaurant!The food at Luce was absolutely fabulous. I would put it up there with Danko, Flur de Lys, and other 4 star restaurants in town. This was some of the most innovative cuisine in the city. Chef Dominique Crenn who has worked at both Campton Place and Stars in SF has really put together a fabulous menu from top to bottom. As others have said the Scallops are fabulous. The Venison and the Pork Belly and Lagostine (chef specialty) were also great. The star of our night however was a primi pasta course that the kitchen very nicely split up for us. This was a Black Spaghetti  Carbonara with baby calamari, poached egg, pancetta and parmesan. WOW was it good. One of the best dishes Ie ever had. The deserts were also great and very innovative. The presentation of all the food was impeccable with beautiful color on the plate and such innovative touches as foam and candied fruit. The wine list is great with a good selection of Italian wines. We had an Ornellaia Super Tuscan that was fantastic (and not too warm). The service was also fabulous. Our server was very attentive and friendly. She was knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendation after great recommendation. We only had one service hiccup where a french press of coffee was pressed too early but the staff quickly fixed it and brought another.I can say enough about our experience at Luce. It was absolutely fantastic and I will not only be back myself - I will be telling all my friends. Go here with confidence you will have a fabulous meal and a great experience!!!Food - 5 starsService - 5 starsAmbiance - 4.5 starsBar - 4.5 stars', 'So, this is where the down home, cowgirl in me comes out. When you read this review - keep in mind that I am not refined. Ie never been to France, never been to cooking school. I can make a mean plate of lasagna, chicken enchiladas or potato salad and that about where my culinary expertise ends.Luce is elegant, beautiful and classy. I like getting dressed up every once in awhile, experiencing the finer things, etc.The decor is phenomenal. I love the lights. Shiny-black-swirled levitating orbs, filled with lights that have the appearance of candles. They are the only circular items in a sea of squared edges.The service was over the top. We had 4 different people swarming around our table, setting dishes, taking away un-needed silverware, filling our glasses, etc. That napkin guy is fun to observe. Watch someone get up to use the restroom and it like he has a sixth sense. He feels them leave, scans the room for an empty seat - runs over and replaces their napkin with a fresh one. I even saw him realize he had placed one of the new ones upside down (how he can tell - I don know) but he ran back over and corrected it.I loved how everything that was presented to us was explained in detail. How it was prepared, where it came from, etc.The first thing we were presented with was a tiny little glass, filled with liquid. He told us it was vanilla something, infused with something, served with a mint leaf and a cherry blossom. I held it up and sure enough a tiny little fragile cherry blossom was floating inside.Do you drink it or look at it? I smelled it and wow. The incredible medley of scents in that tiny little glass was mind blowing. I took a sip and it really not something I can do justice to describe. If you could taste a warm toasty cabin, filled with hot apple cider stirred via cinnamon stick - that what it reminded me of.Ie never met cooked spinach that I liked. Luce spinach is the exception to that rule.So here where the magic fizzled for me. I ordered the scallops with caviar. I not a big fan of seafood. If it cooked perfectly and doesn smell like fish - I like it. Other than that, I not a happy camper. I figured that Luce would be the place to order it, if I was going to.So, uh - scallops isn my thing. Nor is caviar, apparently. It didn smell like fish and so I sure it was prepared correctly. I just didn care for it. The tangerine salad, that it was served with, was great though. I snagged a bite of my husband rib eye and wished I had ordered that. It was adorned with an amazing smoky, brown sugar coated sauce.Our bottle of wine - something French - was excellent.We finished off with the study of chocolate dessert and that made up for every bit of my scallop filled belly of disappointment.', Came here on a Sunday night so it wasnt too crowded. The service was excellent and I was pleased. I went to the bar for a cocktail when I arrived. The cocktail menu had lots of unique drinks to choose from. I had the daiquiri served up.I loved everything served to us. We ate it family style although these are not served as so. We had the Prime Rib, The Cod and the Scallops for dinner. The cod was my favorite but Id get any of these dishes again!The restaurant and bar definitely had a hotel vibe but I like'd it. The space is very open and the bar area had a sexy lounge area.Ill go again., I was disappointed. No doubt the restaurant is gorgeous and the food was good, but the staff seemed disorganized. The night I went, it was just my friend and I. We made reservations and stood at the podium waiting to check in. We stood there for what felt like a long time until someone came to greet us. The hostess finally acknowledged us. She walked us to our seats and handed us menus and a wine list. So we decided to let that go. No harm no foul. So far, so good I guess. But then, seriously, I'm not even kidding... we sat, and sat, and waited and waited, about 15 minutes. Not a single server came by to introduce themselves, no one came to pour water, or deliver a bread basket. Nothing. I finally flagged down the hostess again and asked if we had a server. She looked alarmed since by now it had been almost 20 mins since we were seated. There was a little gathering in the back and finally someone came out to take our orders. Despite the poor service, I do have to admit the food was delicious. We ordered a bottle of Spanish white wine (Verdejo), beet salad (it looked like artwork on a plate), sauteed spinach and we both got the Crab Fettucini. That was good. The pasta tasted homemade. So... one star for the ambiance and one star for the food. It's really a shame because the place is nice, and looks like it has so much potential. But my takeaway as I left that night is that it is what it is - - just a dressed-up hotel restaurant., One of the most amazing meals I've had lately. The restaurant is pretty new and located in the InterContinental hotel. The restaurant itself is lovely, decorated in muted colors and with lovely dark wood chairs and tables. I also have to give a shout out to our waiter, Eva. She is one of the best I've ever had. Knowledgeable, sweet, unobtrusive and just all around awesome. It really seemed like she loved food and enjoyed her job. On to the food which was A-MAZE-ING. We had two pastas, one main and the side of steak fries. For the main, we got the scallops which were tasty but I think suffered from the scallops being slightly overcooked and also suffered from coming after the pastas which were SUBLIME. We got the carbonara with the squid ink trofiette, pancetta, baby calamari, egg and parmesan. It was soooooooo good. One of the best dishes I've had ever. We asked them to course everything for us which they were nice enough to do the plate came out with the egg whole and we broke it and stirred the pasta all around til it was rich and creamy and to die for. The squid ink pasta gave it an interesting depth and the smokiness of the pancetta played off the creaminess of the egg. So good. I didn't think the next dish would be be as good but it was even better. We got the linguine with crab, grapefruit and blood orange. It was an amazing fusion of italian and asian flavors and unbelievable. It was so good I wanted to order another portion! If you go, you MUST get this dish. Extraordinary. Lastly, the steak fries were so tasty but hello it's a fry sprinkled with parmesan. What could be bad?The desserts. Apparently the chef does both the mains and desserts. Uh hi, can I marry you? We got the creme fritta, um yum! Delicious fried cream with amaretti cookies and asian pear (more italian/asian fusion, how hot is that?) pumpkin spice semifreddo and this AMAZING nutella panna cotta which was so delicious that I'm still dreaming about it. Five well deserved stars. Great new addition to the city!!, 'I completely understand it can be overwhelming when a group of 17 wants to eat at your restaurant..... if you are not set up for such things. However, if you are a fine dining establishment, complete with a private dining room, that is touting itself as the next it place in town, then one would think you could figure it out. Our group arrived on time, and were swept through the restaurant into a room that was about 15 degrees warmer than the rest of the establishment. When I commented on this the server went to the wall and turned down the music. Last I checked music does not affect the climate. Once we were all seated drink orders were taken. Some of us ordered cocktails and the rest opted to start in on the red or white wine that we requested be kept flowing, regardless of how much we drank, throughout the course of our being there. Imagine our surprise when 20 minutes after our cocktails arrived half of our party was still waiting for their wine. It got to the point where someone on the opposite end of our table had to ask where it was. Meanwhile, down at our end we requested that we be able to order some appetizers. We had prearranged a prix fixe first and second course menu since they do not offer the full menu to parties as large as ours, and wanted to add a little something to what we were already getting. Imagine our surprise when we were told no. One of our party spoke to the manager who decided it would be okay to let us order 5 of the same thing or 2 each of a few other things, but 4 of three different things would overwhelm the kitchen. The kitchen of a huge new restaurant that was 3/4 empty. We finally talked her into 4 of one thing and 2 of two others. Well the two of two others came, about the time our wine finally arrived, and the 4 orders of the other appetizer? It never arrived. And it was put on our bill, and our bill was placed next to several empty wine glasses, some of which had not been filled up for some time despite our request for ample wine. And they gave us a hard time about the extra charge, and we ended up paying for it since the owner of our company was at the table and we didn want to make a scene. To top it off the food was good but not great. Some was wonderful but some seemed a bit unoriginal and when it arrived the servers were confused about who ordered what. Horrible service at a premium price? I don think so. It doesn matter how cool and it your place tires to be. As much as I love my company and the wonderful company I get to keep at these dinners this is not somewhere I will recommend or return.', Luce was gorgeous. I love the decor and the high ceilings here. There's a modern quiet calamity type of atmosphere here. The menu was a bit confusing for me but I don't read menu's for a living so maybe it's just me. Nothing really jumped at me that I felt compelled to order so we ordered a whole bunch of stuff which came out pretty quickly, beautifully plated, iron-chef style. You know, where the plate becomes a palate and the meal is off centered, sauce is drawn in a semi circle.... Flavor-wise, everything was just okay. the simple salad was...well...simple. The pork belly which was supposedly braised for 24hrs is mediocre. I feel like they took so long to make sure the plates were pretty the food got lukewarm. it's okay.. thats all I have to say., Yelp really needs a more granular rating scale. I really want to give this place 4.5 stars, but I can't!!! A couple of my friends too me here for my birthday the other night and it was great. Maybe it's partly because I didn't have to pay...but that's beside the point. This place is huge with high ceilings and decorated modernly, not too stuffy for a nice restaurant. I usually rate a restaurant more on the food and the food here was really good. The appies were all little morsels of delight. Our middle course of squid ink pasta was awesome, tasted like pasta from the sea. My entree of venison was a bit on the rare side, but I think that's how you're supposed to eat it. Our desserts were a good ending, just the right amount of sweetness, but not over the top., What a gorgeous little place.The ladies and I stopped in for brunch before the Style Lounge San Francisco event at the W. We were more than pleasantly surprised. The remodel and construction of the hotel seems to be complete and the interior of Luce feels cool, modern and fresh, yet comfortable and inviting. The staff was very helpful and accommodating as a few members of our party were running late, they even left the brunch buffet on display a little past cut off time so we could look it over. I'd advise against the buffet brunch. Although the offerings were very diverse those at our table that did order it were not that impressed, the fresh fruit and pastries were a hit while everything else fell flat, order the pastry basket instead. Stick to the tried and true brunch dishes. I was singing the praises of my Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict with Fennel and Cucumber Salad. One of my dining companions couldn't get enough of the Vietnamese Berkshire Pork Belly Sandwich she ordered. Great food, excellent service and two rounds of mimosas made for the perfect brunch. Luce has been added to my list of great places to meet up for drinks before a night out of serious fun. . . ., 'I live a block from this restaurant and have been wanting to check it out for a while. All the reviews are great so I figured it was worth a shot. YES - the food is really good, but not amazing. The lobster stew, which was the most expensive item on the menu, was not well put together and the sauce left much to be desired. The real reason for the 1 star is the service. We had three or four different people come to our table during the evening, and by the end of the night no one noticed us and we continued to have to get their attention to pay the bill and get our receipts. Not professional. This was on a Sunday night when there was very little traffic in the restaurant, so there is no excuse. Simply unacceptable from a place touting to be the best. I will not go back.', 'Sunday evening at Luce , a new restaurant at the Intercontinental Hotel.Started with a shrimp ceviche amuse.Delicious...ordered the onion soup and faro with crispy calamari ..the soup was velvety and the flavor so well balanced.the foie gras was one of the best that we ever had , the presentation was just beautiful.the pintade two ways was exquisite , leg is confit and the breast is served as a roulade stuffed with wild mushrooms and truffle.The crab linguine was so creative and the flavor ...wow..AMAZING...So we went on to the desserts ..and they were as creative and delicious as the rest of the menu.Study of chocolate is a MUST.The presentation of each dishes are just beautiful , nice portions and very affordable ...I suspected this place will do really well . very talented chef ..kudos....we left so impressed..we will be back....great addition to the city...Oh and the service was delightful ....Alicia was our server', We walked up to the reception desk as another party was was being seated. At once, another employee took her place and greeted us. Wow! Service was very nice, timing good, food and drink very tasty. Main course and Dessert were perfect! My dessert looked and tasted incredible. Maybe I'm to into detail, great vibe, service, pace...then my cappuccino arrives. It's tasty but looks very plain. I wish they spent a few moments creating a swirl or leaf design in the froth. Don't get me wrong, this was a perfect lunch, just the swirl design would have made it MORE then perfect. lol, 'This is our current favorite restaurant in San Francisco. Have eaten there three times in the past month, including on my birthday. Some of the dishes are extraordinary and all are good. The cooking takes more chances than most other high-end restaurants, and often succeeds in surprising/delighting. There was a celery cappucino soup that I am still savoring a day later (and I don usually like celery). Foie gras with rhubarb leather strips that was maybe the best I ever had. An apple martini dessert that I couldn even describe, but adored. Most of the food is unlike anything Ie had elsewhere -- combining tastes in a surprising way. Really high quality. Others have noted the mediocre bread -- which I say is a plus, because I wouldn want to waste a mouthful on anything but the spectacular cooking. I will eat here once a month without fail.', passing by at dinner time, i mean hey why dont i try to help yelpers to eat here nexttime or not. It's a cute small restaurant in intercontinental hotel.it's not so noisy ambient, but just a lot of people talking, so i wouldnt recommend this to aromantic couple, but if you dont mind a lil noise then it should be fine. The place is also a lil' dim in the lighting at night.Ate the calamari brochette & yellow fin tuna tartare for appetizer.For the main course. Ate the risotto & scallops. Overall, it's not bad taste, it's different, but the price i would not recommend if you'd save your bucks. I ate somewhere else better,but cheaper than LUCE.The service was nice.So, it's all up to you to decide., Forgettable . . .so much so that I can't think of anything to write about my experience here! I remember my steak being a disappointment- it was not as rare or seasoned as I'd like it to be. Granted it's a beautiful space, but being only half full on a Saturday night, I'm guessing the fancy decor isn't fooling anyone., 'Brutal. First, it was a hot friday night outside when we chose to eat at LUCE. So we walk up to the nicely lit entrance on Howard Street with the nice signage only to be greeted by a cheap paper sign in the window that says: Use Main Entrance Not a good way to start dinner at a high end restaurant. Second, we are seated in the dining room under a blowing Air Conditioner despite the fact that the temp is pleasant in the restaurant. We are relocated without a hassle but we watch the hostess try seat two other parties at our old table only to be rejected by the diners. We notice a poor british toursit couple putting on sweaters at dinner (mind you, it was 75 degrees outside). So, does the hostess notify the floor manager? Does the manager notice the customers? No, he just stands at the entrance and gossips with his assistant manager and service staff. Completely annoying. Now the food, a way over salted and uninteresting scallop/ribeye take on surf and turf--flavors flat. A nice ahi tartare, but who the hell can screw that up. The squid ink pasta with egg, that some have mentioned---completely flat. Adequate but not exciting. And, a seafood stew with saffron, that was pretty tasty, but overly dramatice with a langoustine plopped in the middle of the bowl, but harboring no meat. We said no to dessert (and to any other wine) and paid and left. To add insult to injury, as we walked out of the restaurant, having spent $150, the Manager and his Assistant Manager didn even bother to look up to say good bye or thanks as we passed by. Complete union employees. As for the space, I don think it a nice spot at all, too high of ceilings and empty feeling. As a side note, at my post dinner trip to the urinal it was noted by me and another guy (as we were standing waiting to piss) that why would a hotel build a lobby bathroom for use by restaurant and bar patrons that had only one urinal? One urinal? Totally bizzarre.', I see a tie-breaker coming but for now lets give it 3 stars.This place is right next to my work so it is very convenient for lunch. My first visit, a week after the opening, was absolutely amazing. The seafood pappardelle, even though it was served with linguine instead of pappardelle, was one the most delicious dishes I have ever had. The fish was so silky and luscious that I could not get it out my head for days. My friend had the burger that she equally liked. We also liked the little touch of serving a little container of simple syrup with their iced tea.The second visit was entirely a different experience. Even though I was tempted to try the sea food pappardelle again, I decided to try something different. My experience was so forgettable that I don't even remember what I had. My co-worker had the lamb sandwich that looked very good but she was quite underwhelmed. Even the iced tea came without the syrup.A third visit is definitely in order. I will post an update as soon as I go back., Gary Danko, move over. The most exciting cuisine San Francisco has seen in awhile, complemented by stellar service in a setting with a cool, lounge like vibe. We started with the best negroni ever crafted by friendly bartender David, and moved on to the rock star booth in the dining room. The napkin was of an amazing Italian linen, Frette-like. The bread (a French balon) was hot, crust perfect. We split the crab linguine, plate lined with a gorgeous ribbon of beet paint, generous sweet chunks of crab married perfectly with the pasta, garnished with petit flowers. My husband had the pintade (guinea hen) 2 ways, the breast meat was wrapped in pancetta with truffles and wild mushrooms - sublime. My perfectly seared halibut came dusted with chorizo powder, lending just a hint of fabulous smoke and salt, nestled atop fresh corn and garnished with silky corn puree, mini nectarine bites and the gorgeous flowers again. The dessert was incredible also: biscotti, gelato, olive oil cake and a honeyed banana chip, in a glass - a textural delight. A++++++++++++++++++++++++ and we sincerely hope the slightly off track location won't deter diners. This is a place for serious foodies., I'd driven past this place how many times, always trying to peer in as I made a right hand turn. I finally realized it was a restaurant and when I then again realized that it was in the Intercontinental Hotel which also housed Bar 888 ( which I'd been wanting to try), so I was thrilled. Now I could kill 2 birds with one stone! Perf!So off I go to make reservations on opentable.com. My friend and I spend a little time in the bar first. Great service, great nibbles, and yes, great drinks. After we decide to see if we can get seated earlier than our reservation had specified. Fortunately, they were able to accomodate us. The decor is so swanky and reminiscent of some of the swanky and upscale restaurants in NYC. I loved it! It wasn't packed but their were plenty of people seated around us, and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves too.For the food, we had started with the tuna tar tare and ocean and land. Two words, olive ice cream...stop thinking what you're thinking and head out to try it. It was different and definitely yummy. The presentation of the apps were amazing too. For our main entrees we had the Black cod with cous cous and organic linguine. Amazing, and again, the presentation of the entrees was so pretty...so much so that I hated to dig into it, but I was hungry so I oohed and awed for a minute then took a bite of my black cod and beet soaked, red colored cous cous. Deelish! They also had a lovely list of wines, but I stuck to dirty martinis that night.The service was superb too. I love it when you are free to ask any passing server for something without having them shoot you the stink eye. Everyone from the servers, the hostess, the bus boys were fantastic. I'm running out of adjectives I know but they are well deserved. Our server was full of suggestions and knew exactly how many times to come by to ask if everything was okay without being annoying. They also seemed thrilled to describe the food on our plates and even the bus boy was excited to tell us about the (well known) S.F. food critic who had dined there only days before. Now that's my kind of place. Everyone is happy to be there and happy to serve you. If there were any problems with Luce, it would be that the word about them hasn't gotten out too much yet, but it is starting to. A friend sent me an e-mail that the concierge in her apt building sent the tenants recommending Luce to them. So see, it is getting out. It might very well be my new favorite restaurant in S.F., and although I'd like to keep this gem to myself, I'd also like to see Luce do well. So do yourself a favor and get on over to opentable.com and make yourself a reservation stat!P.S. The Metreon and Century theaters are literally a hop, skip and a jump away so you can catch a flick either before or after. Also, don't forget to stop at Bar 888 for a drink before. You have to pass it to get to the restaurant so make a point of it., 'When you enter Luce, it like a step back in time. Not like the Restoration or the Dark Ages or anything cool and pestilence-ridden like that. No, I talking about the funkadelic 1970...silvery purple bubble lamps...glittery pendant lights...long banquettes...why, it Studio 54 without the disco music...or the coke...no, no, the other kind of coke...Oh, that the way, uh-huh uh-huh,I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh.That the way, uh-huh uh-huh,I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh.That the way, uh-huh uh-huh,I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh...OK, it not quite so polyester that you see the Silver Convention serving you in their platform shoes. But there is a certain feel of the Carter years in here, especially the metallic-hued chairs cradling my derriere. I don eat this fancy-schmancy very often (...note my robust cheap eats list), but my friend Sherry and I came here for dinner last night because I wanted to reciprocate a generous dinner she bought me at Fish and Farm a few months back.It a very nice dinner menu they have here. We actually spent time reading the lengthy story behind the restaurant. The late Robert Mondavi son Michael had a hand in it and recruited Chef Dominique Crenn to commandeer the kitchen. She has impressive credentials at fancy-schmancy places like the late, great Stars, Campton Place, and Adobe in LA. The food sounds very elegant...I learned new terms like kumquat escabeche and wild ramp (...no, not the bayside dive in China Basin).Sherry and I started with two appetizers both beautifully presented. The first was the $12 Coke Farm Baby Beets which came with mache, goat cheese and pistachio nuts. Very fresh tasting. The second was their specialty - the $12 Ocean and Land which is described as a surf-and-turf carpaccio. It looks like they rolled up beef tenderloin, salmon and sturgeon and then flattened them out into concentric circles. Hard to pick up, but it was a nice combo of flavors, especially with the spicy black Italian olive ice cream on the side.The entrees we chose were knockouts. Sherry had the $29 Halibut served atop a mound of corn and surrounded by clams and chunks of white nectarine (see my photo). The piece-de-resistance was a concoction called Chorizo Dust. I know that sounds like a gay Mexican porno film, but it was actually a flavorful almost-seasoning that looked like saffron. I ordered the $30 Colorado Lamb which consisted of two lamb chops, a pile of lamb cheeks cradled in a pool of apricot tagine with some onions and a smear of pea mint puree. Incredible and quite a presentation (see my photo).We actually had champagne instead of wine since we were feeling festive - a couple of flutes of cuvee were just what we needed. Of course, we needed to try their dessert menu and the big whoop-tee-do is the $14 Study of Chocolate. It was made up of a brownie-like fudge baked in an eggshell with a little sandwich cookie, a couple of mini-beignets filled with a chocolate ganache, a chocolate pot de creme, a fresh berry puree, and a spoonful of chocolate sorbet. Very nice and ain it pretty (see my photo)?A most satisfying meal worthy of a return visit. It was a Monday evening, so it never did fill up much. My guess is that most of the customers were hotel guests. A shame really because locals should try discovering it, too. Service was quiet, informative, unobtrusive. Just the way you like it...uh-huh, uh-huh.FOOD - 5 stars...beautiful presentation matched by the creative combo of flavors...breakfast and lunch must be quite something here, tooAMBIANCE - 4 stars...Shake shake shake, shake shake shake ...Shake your booty! Shake your booty!SERVICE - 4.5 stars...very helpful and stealth-likeTOTAL - 5 stars...oh, let call it a new find, shall we?', 'Went here for lunch and it was awesome! While I am not a fan of hotel restaurants, this one was amazing.I had the garlic potatoe soup and the warm spinach salad. It was definitely a wipe the bowl and plate clean with amazing bread meal. The chef even came out to talk to us.I would definitely recommend Luce for a business lunch or a hot date. Their wine selection is amazing and you are right downtown to go out after dinner.', 'I really surprised to see the outpouring of positive reviews about Luce. If youe not easily blinded by slinky decor (definitely the highlight of the experience) I think you will find the place completely devoid of charm. The cocktails were enjoyable enough but the tuna appetizer was beyond boring. Because I thoroughly wanted to be impressed by the food, I ordered the Kobe entree, prepared also to swallow the accompanying exorbitant price-tag. My reaction was something along the lines of, Mheeh. At least it was cooked appropriately. Most disappointing of all was the service, or lack thereof. Our poor waiter seemed so confused at the simplest questions, or maybe he was just overwhelmed by a table of 8 women. They do get one star for being able to accommodate a large party at short notice on a weekend. Although, I not sure that really a great thing for a restaurant.', 'Came here to celebrate Father Day. I knew they had a prix fixe for the night, but I thought you could order off the regular menu too, but nope. I was wrong. I was really hoping to try the risotto Michael Bauer mentioned was a must to try, but I guess next time.Overall the experience is great. High ceilings, cool lighting, huge wooden doors in a modern setting. It was not crowded at all, so easy to have a conversation.The see through drapes hid the not so pretty sight of 5th Street. Our table was by the window, so natural lighting was pleasant. amuse: balsamic vinegar marinated cherry with fresh mint. I see this as a trend. Ie had fruit with either salt or balsamic vinegar with fresh mint at other places, but truly refreshing every time.white asparagus soup with hazelnuts and truffle oil: could have been hotter. you could tell the soup was poured way ahead.. it started to be filmy. The truffle oil was a must - or else it would have just been a sweet creamy soup.frisee salad with duck, kumquat and grapefruit: served on a slate! very fresh, perfectly dressed and surprisingly refreshing.lamb with fava beans: supposed to be halibut, but I requested it to be substituted since i am allergic. the balsamic reduction on the side of the plate complemented the fava beans with chive flowers cooked in a chicken consume i think was so delicious. my lamb was also so tender and cooked medium rare. niman ranch beef with artichoke and onion: buttery goodness.warm chocolate cake in an eggshell with chocolate Parisian macaroon: oh my this was good. the eggshell of goodness. break the thin chocolate crust with your chiwanmushi spoon into the warm gooey chocolate ooze. the macroon was too sugary though.. too sweet.thumbs up: you can tell the chef has skill, warm bread with butter that tasted like real butter, atmosphere, dessert, meat, salad.. six courses for $55.thumbs down: soup needed to be hotter, they added 18% gratuity to our bill when we only had 4 people and the receipt said they would only do that with parties 5 or more... the waitress said, oops. the register did it by accident. that weird. Il have it fixed right away.', 'I went here for dinner with five of my friends. We got the five course tasting menu with the wine pairing and both were EXCELLENT!The dishes were creative, combining ingredients that I would have never thought of. The chef came out multiple times to explain the different dishes with us and discuss other matters relevant to cooking and her philosophy. The staff was courteous and responsive. The environment was a little noisy, sometimes making it difficult to hear what the dish/wine was. Overall it was a wonderful experience and I plan on returning there for many more meals! I am very excited to try their Farm the Table meal on Sundays. How can you beat fresh food from the SF farmer market?', I thought the service at Luce was excellent, as was the meal. I shared the tasting menu with friends and ate some very creative and yummy food. The crab pasta that is also on the regular menu was the highlight of the meal--worth five stars on its own! The two dishes that I really liked were the fois gras with cherries and the raw Kampachi. I'm giving this restaurant five stars because they had some outstanding dishes, and it did not feel like a hotel restaurant. I'm planning on a repeat visit, maybe for the 35 oz ribeye for two and the mushroom risotto. People should ask the server for what he/she recommends because this restaurant does make some dishes that are better than others., I came to Luce on Father's Day and they had a pre-fixed menu with five courses. First of all, I have to give Luce props for very unique presentation. The amuse bouche was a cherry soaked in a balsamic vinagrette topped with a sprig of mint that was (interestingly enough) tasty, and came on a large silver spoon. Other courses included an asparagus soup, a salad with duck (I believe), halibut, and beef tenderloin. The dessert was presented very nicely with a chocolate macaroon and fudge in a thin egg shell (which was situated on a plate that fit the egg perfectly). The chocolate itself was, ok, nothing special. The fish was tender, the meat cooked well.So yes, nice top chef presentation. Food wise, it was good but given the price it could have been tons better. I guess I am a little biased because I was recently spoiled rotten by an AMAZING six course meal, so Luce had a lot to compete with.If you have dollars to drop and you are more into presentation and a swanky, chic atmosphere, this place is for you. But if you're like me and those things are nice but not as important as the food, I might search a bit harder on yelp for other options - just in case., Dinner and desserts here were great. Desserts especially--we ordered every single desert on the menu and they were all artfully prepared and absolutely YUM! I have to give it a 5 star rating for dinner.Don't waste your time for lunch though. I took a coworker for his birthday and it was a complete disgrace. I was totally embarassed at the lack of attention, the awful food, and the piece-of-ish cake that they threw together at the last minute. Zero stars for lunch., Went for a friend's birthday dinner and it was exquisite. Amazing delicate and simple flavors. The Kampachi was brilliant with kumquats and delicate herbs. Flavors were so complementary. And the lamb--holy moly. Lamb cheek and perfectly cooked, tender portions of tenderloin. The perfect amount of food. And the lightest most wonderful sorbet to finish. Not too sweet, but sweet enough. Altogether an amazing meal and wonderful service. The chef Dominique even came out to say hello. A brilliant evening. Can't wait to go back., Delicious!!!!! Dined here last night with two friends for a birthday dinner. Every course was delectable. Dominique is an absolute darling. Great wine list; great space. I'll definitely be back. The kampachi crudo with kumquat and lotus root was my favorite, but the lamb cheek was a close second!, This is an awesome place! gorgeous dining facility, very kool bar and delicious dinner menu and a reasoable price! We celebrated my wify's bday here with friends. The waiter was very attentive, set us up for the right tasting menu items and luv the dessert! Did i mention great wine selection...Good food, good service and good price... what else can u ask for!, I would give it 3.5 stars.I prefer Ame and the St. Regis Hotel over Luce and the Intercontinental, but that is ME.The exterior looks like something from the Emerald City in the Wizard of Oz. The interior was not amazing, but clean and modern.We decided to try Luce since it received 4 stars on Yelp. We ordered a Sicilian white wine for $40 and the 5 course chef's tasting menu.The courses came out in elf portions. At first I thought the first couple of dishes were amuse bouches, but they were actually part of the chef's tasting menu!Aside from the teeny weeny portions, the food was actually very good. The foie gras was perfect with the buttered toast, the sorbet was tasty, the organic strawberry salad was delicious, etc. Our waitress was nice and talkative.During the meal, we were interrupted several times by a jack hammer. The bus boy did apologize, but it was distracting nevertheless.Chef's Tasting Menu for 2 = $130Wine= $40Total + Tax + Tip = $214Overall, the dining experience was average. Not memorable. Food was good with nice presentations, but the portions were small, the service at times were spotty (took 15 minutes for our third course), and the ambiance was a little bit too West Elm decor for me.It didn't work for me. Because I am still hungry!, There's a lot of plus points for Luce. The dd9cor is fantastic, nice and minimal but comfortable nevertheless, and the food is very good indeed. Only had a single course lunch as it was a work thing but the seared tuna was well spiced, with a well dressed salad. Also got a round of fries because, hell, can't be healthy all the time and thee were very good, although giving everyone their own mini-bottle of ketchup was a bit wasteful.But the reason this only gets three stars was the service. Despite a booking, and a 3/4 full restaurant it took 20 minutes to get seated and the staff had a real attitude. It then took 45 minutes from ordering to getting the food, which for a business lunch isn't acceptable.Still and all it's not bad, just don't go if you're on a schedule., 'Want to feel the wasteful heady sensations of a trip to Vegas, without leaving SOMA? Well, stroll on down to Luce in the new blue Intercontinental Hotel. Make sure you say the name like Phil Hartman used to say The Continental on SNL, but don, for God sake, use the door to the restaurant that underneath the big sign for the restaurant, because that door is locked, of course. Are you crazy? That would make sense, and nothing about the Intercontinental makes any sense, from its Miami-blue glass to its slummy location. Go in the hotel front door (off to the side where the valets go, natch), and wander back until youe enveloped by Luce Studio 54 by way of West Elm decor. On a recent Thursday night, there were maybe three other parties in the entire cavernous space that could probably hold 500 patrons, so our party was seated at a large table right in the curvy window spot at the corner of 5th and Howard, the incongruously dismal view shielded from our sensitive eyes by a silvery curtain scrim. Okay, granted, somebody knew somebody so our service was pretty attentive, and perhaps for this reason we were given a little appetizer thing that put the amuse in amuse-bouche: a dollop of blue cheese with some sort of berry-licious sauce in a tiny little spoon. Random, but fine. Food was good but emphasized style: an $11 carrot soup consisted of a bowl in which three miniature root vegetables and some drizzles of cream were arranged artfully, and then the server ladled the carrot soup in right there in front of you. Tasty, but eye-rollingly showy. Entrees hovered around $30 but were more solid: a game hen roulade prepared two ways including small rolls of breast meat surrounded by salty pancetta was pretty darn tasty. But for desert, more ridiculousness: some sort of chocolate goop in an actual egg shell proved impossible to extract without getting bits of shell in your mouth; weird bits of fried custard were accompanied by canned-tasting pear chunks. The whole experience has that rich people wasting money vibe, which may be part of the point in Vegas, but in SF, there are 100 better places to spend $30 on an entree, and 50 better places to spend $30 on dinner for two. It not like there anything that wrong with Luce, but like its host hotel, it feels like it just landed there from outer space, and I just don see the point.', I'd probably give it a 3.5. The food and service were actually quite good. But as a local, I probably wouldn't go back. It was half empty on a Friday night, and the people that were there seemed to be people staying at the hotel. It just had a weird feel to it. Perhaps it was the bright red Burlington Coat Factory sign across the street that was glaring into the restaurant. There are plenty of other restaurants in the city that I'd rather frequent--I'll leave this one for those out-of-town convention guests., next to the hotel bar 888, this resto has a clean and sleek interior. the warmth of the space comes from the service.sean olmstead, the director of food and beverage was very friendly and attentive.but it was our server sandro whom really made the evening with his spot on suggestions and funny anecdotes.the dinner started out with a decadent lobster amuse bouche drowned in butter and topped with super thin slices of fennel.my only regret was sharing the seared foie gras. next time, i'm eating a whole one to myself!the squid ink fettuccine had a deep smoky flavor which was a pleasant surprise to balance the spicy kick.side note: squid ink is known to treat depression and the dish did make me quite happy.the lamb chops were so tender and had a beautiful plating presentation.sadly, i had no room for dessert as i was already full from at a tasting party at bar 888 earlier that night.but if the desserts are anywhere close to the savory dishes...i'm sure they won't disappoint., 'Oh...where do I begin? The husband and I tried this place on a whim and went home satisfied and pleasantly entertained. We opted for the 5-course tasting menu and ended up with about 11 different items!!! When the server said, If you have the time, the 5-course menu would be worth your while., she wasn kidding. And here we go...#1 Amuse-bouche of three different items: melon consomme with one little melon ball, a small dollop of fresh peas and white peach, and (my fave) the heirloom tomatoes with bacon and fried basil. I was amused. #2 Figs and Strawberries served with Strawberry Soil (it was actually pop rocks!!) and mascarpone cream. It all went very well together and it was so awesome to find a place for Pop Rocks in a high-end establishment.#3 Foie Gras on toasted brioche drizzled with Duck Consomme. Yum Yum Yum. This was just heaven melting in your mouth. Is it wrong to slurp up the consomme when youe all done with the foie?! #4 Palate Cleanser: Apple Cider with Apple Sorbet in a champagne flute. Refreeeeeeshing!#5 Poached Lobster with a melon consomme, tapioca bubbles, and basil oil. The combination of flavors and textures was complex and makes you want more!#6 Pan Roasted Quail with pickled onion, chanterelle mushrooms, and brioche veloute. There was also a light sprinkling of sea salt on the quail that really hit the spot. This was my first taste of quail and it was de-lish! #7 Grappa with preserved apricot in a shot glass: a very nice transtion from the quail to the next dish.#8 Pork Two Ways: pork belly with bacon chips over greens and pork tenderloin with a soft quail egg, apple sauce, and granola. Both ways were awesome and the granola was a surprisingly nice touch.#9 Cheese Plate: triple cream brie, pecorino, and another hard cheese (I forgot the name) served with muscat raisins, white peaches, and the tiniest apple cubes Ie ever seen. They all went very well together and I didn need the bread that it came with. #10 Pre-Dessert: Melon Granita served with ricotta cream (tasted like coconut milk) and basil oil. This was one of my faves. The flavors were bright and playful in my mouth.#11 Dessert: Mini cannelloni, raspberry/basil sorbet (the flavors really pop!), tasty maple crunchies, and raspberry coulis and foam for dipping. It was a sweet and refreshing end to a very indulgent meal. Not too shabby for $65/person, eh? It was a pretty cool 3-hour adventure. On top of all the food, the service was great and our server was kind enough to allow us to sample our wine before ordering a full glass. The decor is classy and elegant without the stuffiness you expect from such an establishment. Wel be back for more.', I really enjoyed my meal here. We opted for the tasting menu which really gave the chef an opportunity to shine.The plusses:-the space is really nice and the location is convenient (for me).-the food is really inventive; the beautiful platings combined with the gastronomic (think foams, dusts, sorbets and bacon) are a standout in the bay area-the food prices seemed reasonable; $65 for a 6+ course tasting menu- the service is really professional, knowledgeable, and friendlythe not so positive- the dining room was empty (so more people should go!) meant that it was easy to get reservations but it definitely felt a little too quiet- the drink prices are expensive. it didn't seem like we drank too much but our drink bill (with no bottles of anything) was more expensive than our dinner billI look forward to going back and exploring more of the chef's dishes. I'd likely pay more attention to the drink offerings/prices next time around, though., I am bumping up my previous rating by 1/2 star, so 3.5. We went there again earlier this month to try the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairings. I wanted to give it 4, but I don't think I'd go out of my way to go back repeatedly. At the same time, it was still quite good and I'd say it's worth trying out.Pros:* The price for the tasting menu was really reasonable. * There was some interesting dishes, which while not a personal favorite, I still appreciated, such as the goat cheese ice cream with strawberries.* The ricotta ice cream and basil granita was a really interesting combination. The wine pairing for this was fantastic. Wish I could remember the wine.* The 5 courses turned out to be more like 7 or 8, which I thought was generous.* The service was very good.Cons:* Overall, the tasting menu was overwhelmingly on the sweet side, which is not my preference for food in general.* The wine pairings were just okay. There were a few winners, but I wished there had been more. They also gave us the same sparkling wine for the first 2 courses, which disappointed us a bit., My wife and I both had great meals, good bread, and a nice ly selected glass of wine (suggested by our server). The food here was great (I might even say fantastic) but the service was just OK. This is difficult for me to accept as we had an early reservation at 6pm and were one of only two tables seated in the whole restaurant! You would have thought the waiters would have been falling all over us but no - you could barely flag them down for more water or butter. They seemed to be busy congregating and talking amongst themselves. Then I get an email from Open Table saying that I did't show up for my reservation... What gives? So then I had to scan over my recpt to proove that I dined there- kind of silly., Luce has a long way to go to become the restaurant it is trying to be. The food saves the experience, which otherwise leaves you wanting to cancel your dinner and go just about anywhere else. The design of the restaurant is nice, but unless they can pack some people in it, it feels very empty, and is cold and breezy. We kept our wool coats on throughout the dinner. Service also isn't what you would expect in a fairly empty dining room. We decided to skip dessert and coffee simply to avoid waiting any longer in the environment. They try to add ambiance with music - they need to fire the person choosing their music. I felt like i was stuck in a very large elevator eating dinner. On to the dinner.... by far the shining star at the restaurant. Everything we ate was excellent, and presentation was amazing. We shared a started, a pasta, and a main course. All were fabulous. Our waitress recommended tasty glasses of the wine and the bar has wonderful and unique cocktails. We won't be back anytime soon., 'I went there with some girlfriends the other night and I have to say that the service was great and very attentive. Eva our server was a star.The food was really so so... very 1989 Los Angeles style, nothing Italian about it, some of dishes were decent but boring, been there, done that.The bar had a great feel to it, great bartenders, Gustavo was Fabulous..All theyneed to do is simplify the food...I will return....', 'My girlfriends and I went to Luce for Sunday brunch. Although it is a pleasant venue to gather, eat and have a leisurely brunch, it is pretty expensive for you basic breakfast. I took part in the $25 brunch buffet, which had a nice selection. But it was lukewarm- the eggs, the breakfast meats, the hash browns. I think it would have been delicious-- but for $25? One friend ordered the Salmon Benedict and she said it was perfect! The other had the fancy french toast with bananas. All said-- this is probably a great place for dinner.. but for breakfast, it is just your basic (expensive) hotel food. Service was fine. I will probably try this place again- for dinner only.', GOD! It was the only place I could get a last minute lunch reservation last week! Centrally located near the metreon and moscone, the intercontinental hotel was juuust far away enough that there was room for lunch at Luce. For a hotel restaurant, it's tucked away enough that you don't feel the hustle and bustle from the hotel guests. The setting was neat and tidy with a modern twist on its simplicity. The lunch menu was great and reasonably priced. I'd like to visit for dinner before I can be completely satisfied with patronage., I was not expecting to enjoy Luce as much as I did. I'm skeptical of hotel restaurants, and my experience at Bar 888 in the lobby left me with a poor first impression. I figured it would be too expensive and lack ambiance.And I was right on both accounts. It's not cheap (about $30 entree - making Luce an excellent business dinner choice), and there isn't much ambiance. This is less a restaurant and more a large room tacked on at the end of the lobby. Decor was fine, but too cavernous for my tastes.So why five stars? Simple. Dominique Crenn and her food.The Hawaiian butterfish, complemented with nectarines, chorizo dust and corn was one of the best dishes I've had all year. Outstanding. Rave worthy. Going back on my own dime worthy. Simply amazing. Around the table, my dining companions all loved their selections as well, particularly the carbonara featuring calamari, eggs and panchetta. I got a bite, it was good. Someone also had the surf and turf capaccio for an appetizer, which included black olive ice cream. What? Ice cream with your appetizer? Brilliant.We were so enamored we asked to speak with the chef. Ms. Crenn couldn't have been more friendly, or humble as she absorbed our effusive compliments. She deserves unlimited success.And she apparently appreciated our kind words, because the next thing we knew a few dessert samplers were on their way. On this particular day I did not go to the gym, but had no problem scooping up the smores with handmade marshmallows and what they call inside out carrot cake, topped with cream cheese gelato.This is a candidate for meal of the year. You'll be so enamored with the food you won't even notice the lack of ambiance, or mind the price. Luce is a winner., 'Excellent nouvelle cuisine.It is pricey but well worth it.Do not expect an American rushed service. You are here to enjoy the food not to rush it down;-)Only negative point: this place is relatively new and associated with the hotel. So not many locals go there, I would say ... yet!', What could be a post-modernist's late-night dream, Luce was strangely empty as we enjoyed a 10 p.m. dinner on a Wednesday night. I'm all for an idyllic ambiance, however, we were literally the only diners in the restaurant. Is San Francisco truly so dead, mid-week? Our waitress was charmingly vampiresque, the food was out-of-this-world impeccable, yet the gallows-like mood created by being utterly alone in a rather sprawling space was a bit eerie, to say the least. Maybe San Francisco is too early of a city to support a late-night haunt like Luce. Hopefully not; if only for the futura 70s look and the culinary wizardry, the place deserves a fair shake. If offered, the rose dessert is fresh, clean, very unusual, and highly recommended., 'The good: Excellent , excellent food creatively presented. Great wine list. The bad: Loud as all hell from the bar next door. Lots of drunk tourists watching the Red Sox game and yelling. Why did they seat us on this half of the restaurant, I don know. There were plenty of open tables. And the service was bizarrely rushed. In and out in 70 minutes. How weird is that? It felt like we were eating at a crowded Mission hipster joint rather than an expensive, luxurious restaurant. Our waiter announced the specials, Filet Mignon. Rib eye. No details. I had to press him for more.If youe at Moscone anyway and want some delicious food, and Ame is booked solid, great.', I totally recommend coming to luce for the tasting menu. It was great. The servers are very knowledgeable, friendly, and not stuffy at all. Standouts were: The lobster...It was cooked and seasoned to perfection. The sauces were also really amazing. The combinations accentuated the food and made my tongue very happy. =) My favorite was actually the dessert. It was a simple greek yogurt with a raspberry sauce and guava foam. The foam was like wow. All the flavors worked well with each over. I wish I had 5 bowls of that stuff. The only thing I can really complain about was the fois gras. The texture was off and was very so-so. All and all, it was a great dinner. Also, Chef Dominique Crenn came out and we got to talk to her. She's such a sweetheart. Apparently she's going to be on Iron Chef and perhaps kick Bobby Flay's ass. Yes...those were her own words. Hilarious! Love her!, 'We came here on a Sunday evening on the suggestion of my cousin. Chef Dominque Crenn was not cooking that day but her sous chef was and it was just as good. The four of us were initially thinking we would try the tasting menu but due to certain food allergies 3 of us just ended up ordering off the menu. Every dish we had was excellent - Surf and Turf Carpaccio, Risotto, Carbonara, Butterfish, sorbet, and sampler of chocolate desserts. We will be returning again.', I know, I know...snobs don't like hotel restaurants. But seriously, this place is great. The food is really thoughtful and inspired, and delicious!I had an heirloom tomato salad with goat cheese crisps (mmm! and I don't even love cheese), the curried carrot soup was unique in a good way, the pasta with shaved/dried fish roe (forgetting the name here) was tasty and the truffle/mushroom risotto was so creamy and full of truffled goodness.My only slight disappointment was that the main plates were pretty standard and didn't wow me (pan seared halibut). Oh, and if they made the space a bit more intimate, it would be a really cool restaurant. Right now, it's too open and big and bright., 'its definitely a hotel restaurant - right off the lobby with that vibe and spaciousness that you usually find. the bar was cool, although we didnt get a drink there. the decor went along with the food - inventive and modern. we started with the risotto and the autumn vegetables. the risotto was delicious and hearty - we ate every bit. i wasnt impressed with the vegetables (except the presentation was pretty), their flavor wasnt anything special at all. for my entree i had the butterfish, my friend had the lamb. both were presented beautifully. my fish was good, maybe a tad overcooked but fine. i just didnt think it was anything amazing. we ended up not getting dessert because we were already too full. worth a try but i dont know that i would rush back.'|1
30|marea-new-york|Marea takes over the space vacated by San Domenico, which distinguished itself by serving eminently mediocre italian-lite food bereft of taste, spice, or salt at exorbitant prices to an octogenarian set of regulars. While at Marea, we were joking (morbidly) that SD's clientele must've died off over the recent years to cause the thing to shut down. In its place is Marea, which couldn't be different. Precious, precise, modern vaguely Italian cooking with a focus on truly exceptional seafood. Ambience is still elderly friendly, but with a decidedly mid-century modern with asian-accented laquerwork spin. (Yeah, i don't know quite know what that means either, but seemed like the right descriptor!) It's expensive, the cooking is a little too trendy, the service is still getting it's kinks worked out, but the food definitely makes the joint worth a visit. We felt like we were some of the first customers there (two weeks into its opening, the place still had the fresh-paint smell), but we did feel very welcome. Oysters, the lobster appy, uni spaghetti, octopus pasta, and the dover sole, were all meticulously prepared and presented, elegant, and yummy!, A memorable meal. I would say Marea is better than Le Bernardin if you are looking for an elegant place for seafood because it feels more up-to-date and the food is more interesting (even if one is more Italian while the other is more French).For appetizers, the lobster with burrata wins hands down. The creamy, slightly tangy cheese went superbly with the sweet, perfectly cooked chunks of warm lobster. You HAVE to try this appetizer if it is available.For other appetizers, the uni and lardo was a bit overkill for me, it was overly rich - one piece per person is plenty, I had two. The mackerel was lackluster as it had none of that oily, tastiness I was looking for from this fish, although this dish was certainly well presented and prepared. The softshell crab was good but not particularly memorable.For pastas, my favorites were the fusilli with octopus and the rigatoni with shrimp. A close second would be the spaghetti with uni. The gramigna was also tasty. The pastas all soaked up their respective flavors and were all very very enjoyable. I HIGHLY recommend going with the pastas for your entree. We didn't try any of their non-pasta entrees but I have no regrets at all.We were stuffed by dessert time. I did try the zucchini cake. It was really moist and a very good pick for me and my two friends to share as it came as a small portion with literally a bite for each person., Serving seafood with an italian twist, Marea has the potential to be great, but isn't quite there yet. The restaurant itself is pretty big and there was a good crowd there the night I went, but there was nothing particularly memorable about the atmosphere. It felt a little casual although given the price point, I felt that it should have been a little more elegant.Service was slow. It took about 20 minutes for the waiter to come and explain the menu to us (like how there was a prix fixe option, and what the portion sizes of the crudo vs. the appetizers were, and his recommendations), and this was only after I was blatantly looking around for him for a good 10 minutes and asked a busboy to track him down (it still took a while for him to come). When I asked for a wine recommendation, the waiter didn't even wait for me to finish telling him what kind of wine I liked, he just interrupted me and said he knew exactly what to get me, which turned out to be incorrect. It would have been more helpful for him to actually listen to what I was saying, so he could recommend something that I would be more likely to like the first time.The food itself wasn't bad, but overall was not very memorable:- Bread: You get a choice between three breads, a green olive foccacia, a ciabatta, and I forget the third choice. I had the foccacia which was actually very greasy. Too bad it wasn't served warm either.- Uni crostini with lardo and sea salt: I loved the creaminess of the sea urchin and how the flakes of salt and chewy lardo brought out the sweet, briny flavor. A pretty good start.- Oysters: There are several choices on the menu and they were all very fresh, each one on different ranges on the scale of salty, briny and creamy.- Lobster with burrata appetizer: Delicious! The creamy, mild flavor of the burrata paired perfectly with the tender, sweet lobster. There were skinny pieces of citrusy eggplant as well, which added a nice tart note to the dish.- Seafood risotto: Ok overall. I loved the pieces of seafood but the rice itself was a little on the hard side, not at all creamy the way I expect risotto to be. I think the white wine in the risotto also slightly overpowered the rest of the flavors.- Linguine with crab, sea urchin, basil, and grape tomatoes: although the sauce was different, this actually tasted very similar to the risotto, except with a hint of sea urchin. The fresh pasta had a good texture and I liked the creaminess of the sauce, but it would have been nice to have a few more chunks of crabmeat, and some actual pieces of sea urchin, rather than just a sea urchin sauce. Although this came highly recommended by our waiter, I was actually disappointed.The restaurant is fairly new so it may just take some time to work out a few kinks but overall, even though I really wanted to like this place, I was not impressed, especially given how pricey it is., Went for dinner recently. This is the third jewel in Michel White and Chris Cannon's New York resto crown. It's a beautiful space, the old San Domenico. Food-wise tis is their Italian take on Seafood, so meat eaters beware.They have a huge wine list, we left it up to the sommelier to suggest wines for us and we got some very nice wines to try.For food my all around favorite dish was the fusilli pasta with octopus and wonder globules of bone marrow. One of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. I also had the black bass, which was very good, but again the highlight of the evening was the pasta, definite must have!, I have mixed feelings about this place. The service is superb and our waiter totally accomodating and charming. The crudos was delicious, esp. the cuttlefish and the langostines. I would also recommend the crab salad which is really refreshing. Then comes the negatives - the pastas!! I tasted a few, and they are all just mediocare. Maybe we ordered the wrong ones, but there's nothing to write home about. Although I can say that they are quite sizable and you can certainly get full with them.The atmostphere is like any other midtown 5 star spots - skews older and a bit stuffy. A gentleman in another table stood up when the ladies leave and re-join the table. I didn't make that up., I went here with a fellow foodie friend before a concert at Lincoln Center and it worked out great with how close the two are and with the restaurants willingness to pace our meal accordingly. We started off with ricci (uni and lardo) which was delicious, uni is plenty rich on its own but the salty fat of the lardo made for a welcome addition. Then came a crudo trio which we pieced together, of which only the shrimp stood out in my memory as having been sweet and tasting of the ocean as only great seafood can. Finally for the appetizers was the lobster and burrata appetizer, which was a genius paring. For entrees we split the fussili with braised octopus and bone marrow and spaghetti with crab and uni. The fussili was one of the best plates of pasta I've ever had... period. It took real friendship for me to hand that plate over to switch. The spaghetti with crab and uni was excellent as well, but didn't leave the same impact.I definitely had some 5 star food here and some holy sh*t moments but in the end this place is exceedingly expensive and you should expect nothing less. I'm on the edge but for 5 stars I feel like you shouldn't hesitate recommending a place to anyone. With all factors including cost in consideration, I don't expect everyone to walk out feeling the got full value. PS - this link is pretty helpful newyork.seriouseats.com/43_, This might have been the best meal I've had all summer.Time stopped when I entered the restaurant. It felt like I was going on vacation--the ambiance immediately calmed me, and my worries of the workday seemed to evaporate as I settled into my seat (and they were playing Sinatra). Usually when I'm on a lunch, I'm eyeing the clock to see when I need to be back at the office, but at Marea I just wanted to sit and enjoy.Decor:The dining room was gorgeous, from the paneled wood to the awesome dining chairs (they were very very comfortable). In addition, they had some pretty swanky china.Service:Very attentive and friendly. They pulled out our chairs, refilled my iced tea before I even noticed it was empty, folded napkins when one got up to use the loo, walked around with a bread tray (the bread was warm). It was basically everything you'd expect from this type of restaurant, and executed impeccablyFood:WOW. Amazing. They have a business lunch, which allows you one primi and one secondi for $37. For my primi, I got the Astice (chilled nova scotia lobster, buratta--enough said, you can't go wrong with lobster and burratta cheese) which was exquisite. For my secondi, I ordered the Fussili pasta (baby octopus, bone marrow, tomato) which was rich and delicious. Everything that my comrades ordered looked delicious as well. The pasta was perfectly cooked. Someone ordered this basil raviolli stuffed with ricotta--it tasted so earthy and fresh, yet still rich. It was wonderful. The portions are decent as well. For desert, I had the affogato, which was good but nothing to rave about. Good coffee too--it came in a French press. I was also happily surprised when they came with small plates of pastries/biscotti. I would recommend this to anyone in the area, and I would definitely come back. Everything on the menu looked amazing and I want to try them all., I've been holding out for my big 100th review and last night Marea became worthy of it. (where do I find the time to write 100 reviews?!)We went with another couple of foodies after a movie uptown. We all decided that we wanted to do the 4 course tasting for something like $89 per person. I chose the following: 1. Calamari stuffed with lobster, zucchini, tomato and basil. Quite good. Not mind blowing, but I enjoyed it. 2. Mushroom Risotto. This blew my mind and I never order pasta, but it jumped out to me and it was my favorite dish of the night. Perfectly cooked pasta with large bites of mushrooms. yum.3. Scallops. They were delicious, but I could only eat half because they were huge and I was already getting full. If you're looking for value in terms of price fix and portions, this is your place. 4. For dessert we ordered 4 things that we could all share. All were good, but the Tarone was the stand out dish for me. After being burned at Bar Baloud by a $140 bottle of horrible wine, I went for a $40 Nero d'Avola that was perfect with all the different dishes we had. The restaurant is gorgeously designed and the staff knows how to treat the customers. I would absolutely go back and look forward to it. Oh, and if you live in the 'hood and like to dine at the bar, this is the place for you., 'Marea has it all -- soulful, microbrew Italian beers, a complex, extra-dry brut Prosecco, and skillfully mixed cocktails. The bar is small but intimate, and always prepared with flatbread (at your request) and lightly salted pistachios. The miniature gnocchi were as al dente as they were adorable. No complaints!', 'Typically, i don go out of my way to go to a seafood restaurant, so for me to really want to go here, must mean its got to be great. And, really, it was. Although, we seated in the wayy back even when noone was in the dining room (but i think that was because we were dressed pretty casual, so I don really blame them) service was seamless and the food was delicious. I especially liked the fish-sommelier (don know what else to really call him, but he wheeled around a tray of fish). We tried to crudo with sea urchin and lardo on top as well as a couple kumamoto oysters..so. very. good.Entrees were the fusilli with bone marrow and octopus and spaghetti with crab and sea urchin. Everything was really fresh and you could tell the effort went into making each dish.very good. go here.', 4.5 stars.Now I know what seafood can be like for Italian fine dining. I had their $89 four-course prix fixe dinner, which is actually a good deal for a restaurant of this caliber. I seconded the rave reviews on lobster with burrata and the brilliant pasta. If you're a fan of sea urchin, don't miss the spaghetti. For entree, we tried the adriatic seafood soup and the seaweed-marinated halibut. The different kinds of shellfish in the soup tasted super fresh and delicious. The flavor of the soup itself is on the subtle side but has its impacts as all the ingredients come together naturally. HARMONY! Ironically, when it comes to fish, it's where Marea fell a little short (hence 4.5 instead of 5 in my book). The halibut was well-cooked but somewhat bland as you worked through the meat. The fillet in the seafood soup was also its only weak point. I read many professional reviews on Marea. They all raved about the pasta and just kind of went meh on the fish entrees. I was hoping they were wrong so I had to agree with them on this one. I'm wondering if their fish by-the-pound daily special is better.Desserts were very well-executed. Service is just fine and the atmosphere in the room does not feel stuffy. If Marea could have some flavorful fish entrees on its regular menu, I can easily see it become a Italian counterpart of Le Benardin and received just as many acclaims.PS: I'm quite certain I saw Barbara Walters there. Chef Michael White was cooking in the kitchen and came out to browse the dining room twice. It was a Sat night so It's quite obvious that out of his 3 restaurants in NYC, he cares about this one the most right now., I heard a rumor that the fusilli pasta dish is ridiculously delicious here, and that rumor was true!Dinner started with good and salty olive focaccia. For apps, we had the crudo sampler (I'm not a super fan of ordering sashimi when I'm not in a Japanese restaurant, but the 3 we chose were all so good I'd love to come back and try the whole list! It's definitely the pairing of the raw fish with various flavors that makes it exciting.) Also, the lobster stuffed squid was really good, the tomato juices it was sitting in was unbelievably tasty. The star of the show - my show - was the fusilli with octopus and bone marrow. Pasta was perfect, al dente, and the sauce was so flavorful... highly recommended. If you only go once in your life, make sure you get that pasta. Dessert was a fried polenta, its richness was nicely offset by the tart blackberries. Not a place to go to for the decor, but the food is fantastic, and the staff was awesome and sent me home with a lemony muffin for breakfast the next day. (I have no idea why, but it was thrust into my hands as I turned to make my exit out the door. Hey man, free food, I'm not complaining!), 'Ricci - santa barbara sea urchin, lardo, sea salt.Wow. Did this meal start off with a bang or what. I almost creamed my pants on the first bite. Then, I actually did cream my pants on the second. =XThe uni was a fresh, plump mound of briny, sweet goodness enhanced by sea salt and taken over the top and beyond climax by the rich, oily lard. Hot-Dizzle!Lobster with burrata was really good and something new for me. The Spaghetti with crab, uni, and basil was also good, but the whole pasta and uni thing feels a little played out these days or maybe I just order it too much. Langoustines and pasta was okay, but definitely not worth $36. So really, the ricci got me to climax too early. That thing turned me into a one minute wonder.(from what I hear though, I need to try the fusilli with tomato, octopus and bone marrow)', We arrived at Michael White's homage to Italian seafood, Marea, on the coattails of a recently awarded Michelin star. Expecting greatness, we received nothing but.Ricci, which is one of my new 'death row' meals, is a simple, three ingredient dish of sumptuous sea urchin roe, lovingly cradled by a filament thin layer of cured lardo, on top of a bit of crostini. The richness of uni, made richer with pork fat - i'll gladly double fist this dish with some Lipitor if i'm ever facing the electric chair.Marea's infamous fusilli with bone marrow and baby octopus deserves every bit of critical acclaim awarded to it. Ingredient wise (like most of the dishes here), it's deviously simple. Just a well executed tomato sauce, spiked with a bit of heat, glossed with bone marrow and tossed with braised baby squid. It's a perfectly balanced dish of clean tomato flavors, unctuous fattiness from the marrow, and a springy bite from the house made fusilli. I cleaned my plate, and sheepishly noted that I saved the dishwasher some work.And then there was the uovo, a simple jumble of monkfish cheeks, wild mushrooms and a soft poached egg. Each component was humble, but when combined into a single forkful, they were transformed into an earthy/savory bite of deliciousness. Easily conceptualized, tough to execute, this is simplicity at its very best.My secondi of roasted John Dory with roasted brussel sprouts and pork belly held second fiddle to the rest of the dishes, but was amazing on its own right. The pork added a meatiness to the fish, and I again, cleaned my plate. (the dishwasher probably owes me a beer, since I did most of his work for him)Dinner was topped off by a professionally executed wine service, elegant but subdued decor, and triple digit dinner bills for all diners - easily worth the price paid.A star from Michelin, or 5 stars from this Yelper, Marea is worth the hype and deserves a visit., Yum. The Astice - Lobster & Burrata was a party in my mouth, I am not even a huge lobster fan. Spaghetti with sea urchin and crab was pretty amazing. Yes, portions are small but this ain't the Olive Garden.Exquisite chocolates and biscotti were served with my after-dinner lavender tea.Beautiful restaurant, impeccable service. Also, thanks for the lemon butter muffin... which I totally didn't eat until 2 days later and it was still better than most of the muffins I've ever had., Oh my. Such a lovely space and amazing food. Calm, attentive service. Grown up but not stuffy.Both times I've been I've had the astice (lobster and burrata) and it's just divine. Take that, old Italian convention that seafood and cheese don't go together! And the home made pastas are heavenly. Haven't made it to the fish or meats yet, but I will try next time!Wine options by the glass are reasonable, excellent cocktails too. For a celebration or a special night out, a top choice in my book., 'I heard that Marea just received one Michelin Star so I was pretty excited to try this place out. Our reservation was at 8pm in one October evening. Once everyone was there, we were promptly led to our table. However, service was slow from that point on. It took a long, long, long time for the waiter and sommelier to attend to us! The sommelier did help us pick out two nice bottles of wine though--one white and one red.Seating in the restaurant is comfortable. There sufficient space between tables; you won feel cramped. The noise level is low; you can definitely carry on a nice conversation. This is a great place for a date with that special someone of yours.We were served three types of bread. The one I especially liked was called the poncho (I think) with olives in it. I loved how the soft the bread was; it salivating even as I think of it now.We ordered the Ricci (sea urchin, lardo) and some oysters to share. The Ricci was a true delicacy. One yelper wrote in his review that he creamed his pants after tasting the Ricci, well, I didn quite get there. But to quote George from Seinfeld, definitely, it moved! The oysters were, well, oysters. They were fresh; I have no complaints. I skipped antipasti, but did get a chance to taste my friend Uovo (solo poached egg, crispy monkfish cheeks, wild mushrooms). The monkfish was good and as was the mushrooms. However the egg didn do much for me.For primi, I ordered the much touted Fusilli (red wine braised octopus and bone marrow). The Fusilli was slightly spicy and delicious. However, it was the Lobster Ravioli that my friend ordered that really creamed my pants!!!I ordered the Brodetto Di Pesce (Adriatic seafood soup with clams, scallops, shrimps, etc.) for secondo and this is where Marea came up short. While everything in the dish was good, I was not WOWd by it. And at $45, it a little too steep for a middling dish. The highlight of the evening was definitely the Ricci and the Lobster Ravioli. The slow service and the slightly disappointing secondo are the reasons why I would give Marea only four stars. Although the place is expensive, I paid upward of $140, I would definitely love to dine at Marea again. But next time, I may not be ordering a secondo.', 'Was that Chef Michael White walking around the dining room as we were seated in the cafe area of Marea? Pretty sure it was. Well congrats Mr. White, on yet another culinary wonder. It is impossible to believe he did not grow up in Italy he grew up in the Midwest! His dishes are simple, delicate and yet an explosion of fireworks in the flavor department. We were Ummm...ing throughout the whole meal:SHARED:1. RICCI sea urchin , lardo, sea salt2. SCAMPI pacific langoustines, murray river pink salt3. CAPESANTE scallop, orange, wild fennel, arugulaENTREES:MEZZALUNA lobster ravioli, chanterelles, asparagusSPINOSINI langoustines, pomodoro, basil COTECHINO sausage risotto with melted cod bellyWe had to try the ricci as that is all people talk about it and I understood why; rich, buttery, fatty, melt in your mouth goodness. The Scampi was also fantastically amazing, so delicate and so special. The lobster ravioli was very rich and creamy. Lobster fans rejoice. Spinosini was a generous portion with big lagostines (my favorite!), beautifully plated, perfectly done. MY dish, the cotechino was absolutely delicious, al dente, the kind of dish you savor slowly to enjoy the moment as long as possible. Even though we were very satisfied, we could not pass on dessert: GIANDUJA cocoa nib crema, hazelnut chocolate, fior di latte gelatoZUCHINE zucchini torta, lemon crema frozen yogurtPANNA COTTA vanilla bean panna cotta lemon verbena sauce, blueberry sorbetThe gianduja was like hazelnut chocolate condensed into the perfect form, delectable! Zuchine dessert made me skeptical as I hate veggies but I would eat veggies everyday if it was made like this! Delicious! And the panna cotta was super rich and delicious. Perfect for a celebration, special occasion, date, honestly though, I would not need an excuse to come here, wish I could eat here everyday. I would give up meat and become a fake-fish vegetarian for this place (yes I realize my risotto had meat in it though, but that besides the point!). Delicious!', 'Turning back the tide.If I close my eyes and imagine New York as it existed for me as a child, I envision glittering dining rooms packed to the gills with affluent men and women. The latter absent-mindedly brush their pearls as they exchange hushed conversations, while the men with their loose elbows throw back cocktail after cocktail and blather on about the stock market.I never actually witnessed these settings first hand, because nary a child was mature enough to join the adults in these activities (kids were to remain at home and torture poor Benson DuBois). This impression was formed by countless hours glued to a TV, but I believed it contained a tincture of truth, because life as seen through the boob tube always held out the promise of something extravagant and just out of reach.Entering Marea, I was struck numb by the glam factor. Located on Central Park South, the splendor of the restaurant interior borders on the stupid-rich, with onyx and lacquer in such abundance, you think the surfaces were covered in nail polish.I not one to feel out of place in a restaurant setting unless I wearing one sock and a kilt, which I may as well have been given the noticeable absence of bling at our table. The setting evoked my childhood preconceptions of being too immature for New York, and the city posh scenes as being out of my league. These suspicions cemented, naturally, when Catherine Zeta-Jones and her hubby, Mikey D., were seated at the table across from us.I tried not staring, but then became self-conscious that maybe it was too obvious that I wasn staring, because everyone else certainly was, and who was I to be so self-important that I didn need to ogle at Mrs. D? She looked classically gorgeous, and Mr. D looked every bit the dirty old man who, with a smug grin, broadcast the fact that he was by far the luckiest bastard in show business.The only thing that could pry our laser beam vision away from the celeb grubbers was chef Michael White menu. It wasn so much a menu as it was an expression of fealty to fish.Not just any fish, but really wealthy fish that flew on Learjets to join us for dinner.We skipped over the sections offering crudo, oysters and caviar because we wanted to experience the cooking of Mssrs. White and Gadbaw (chef de cuisine), hence we went for the four-course prix fixe, a selection of one appetizer, pasta, secondi and a dessert. What we experienced was off-the-hook delicious. As others have noted, a beautiful start to the evening is the RICCI. Separate from the prix fixe, the shared item was a piece of warm bread, blessed with a dollop of sea urchin, lardo (pork fat), and sea salt. Rarely is sea urchin appealing to an entire table - the consistency of a warm glob of urchin usually scares off the meek of palate, but not so at Marea. The lardo must have imbued the urchin with magical properties as they disappeared in seconds. Appetizers included a beautiful blue prawn TARTARE (so much for not ordering off the raw menu) with finely chopped and lightly fried Marcona almonds, and a LOBSTER (astice) with burrata and eggplant al funghetto (a way of preparing eggplant so that it tastes similar to mushrooms).For the pastas, we shared FUSILLI with braised octopus that was almost overly rich with the addition of some cholesterol-boosting bone marrow, and a superb RIGATONI with a cuttlefish (seppia) and shrimp ragu, topped with a dusting of pecorino. Secondi memorables were the SAN PIETRO, a light and perfectly textured sautd9ed john dory with its marinated salsify, which lent a hint of oyster-like flavor to the dish, and the procini-dusted SEA SCALLOPS (capesante), that made me second-guess my criticism of restaurants for the overkill of this menu item. This sublime little morsel had me making noises that were just as inappropriate as the eyeballs I was casting Catherine way.One item, the grilled cuttlefish (aka seppia) was a disappointment. Served with braised escarole and smothered in a livornese (tomato-basil) sauce, the poor thing had been cooked a minute or two longer than necessary and had taken on a tough, rubbery consistency. What surprised us most about this dish was our server reaction. He (Gyuri) looked physically pained by our dislike. Without hesitation, he had a menu in front of me and was pleading to make it up to us. I wanted to stand, embrace the guy, and tell him that his sincere concern was far more memorable than the dish, even more memorable than Catherine cleavage (well, not quite, Gyuri, sorry).For the finale, the pastry chef, Heather Bertinetti, delighted us with a GIANDUJA (chocolate and hazelnut capsized boats) that were dusted with cocoa nib crd2me and gelato, and a TORRONE (nougat) with a black cocoa cake and sour cherry compote.In all, our senses were delighted at Marea Italian cooking, the prestige of old New York, and the brush with fame... still ever so slightly out of my reach.', 'Frankly I am bit a surprised at all the glowing reviews. As a San Franciscan I fully concede my second-class culinary status to all New Yorkers, but this was most certainly not a 5-star food experience. Lobster and burrata? that was trendy like 2 years ago. Atmosphere, service, and bar were very good, which saved this from being a 3 star review.-loved the power lunch atmosphere - this place screams 80s (or 2006-07) excess. really great f-you meal spot if youe feeling disdainful of the hoi polloi-drinks and wine offerings were very good - this was maybe the best old fashioned I have had, ever-service was impeccable and definitely 5 stars - I was very impressed with our waitress and the staff generally - attentive but not overbearing or stuffy. -WIth all that said, the food itself was only ok - I tried the Fusilli with marrow and octopus after reading about it in the Times - it was most certainly not the revelation the critic had described. Good, but I suppose its hard to live up to that description. Between the two of us we tried the soup, geoduck, john dory, and fusilli. They were all good but not greatOverall I would say the food was solid but forgettable - it lacked the x factor that would make it a memorable eating experience and was dishearteningly bland given the rather exotic nature of the ingredients (I suppose the restaurant knows its sweet spot of old rich white people). I wish i had tried the uni and spaghetti, maybe that might have changed my mind', 'Chef Michael White and partner Chris Cannon ode to Mediterranean seafood cuisine, Marea (tide in Italian), opened in 2009 to rave reviews and since then has earned One Michelin Star in the 2010 guide. Chef White first rose to stardom at Steve Hanson Soho gem Fiamma Osteria from 2002-2006. Before that, he honed his Italian cooking skills at the famed Spiaggia in Chicago. After his tenure at Fiamma, he took over Scott Conant (Scarpetta) empire including the Tudor City favorite Lmpero (now Convivio) and its spectacular Midtown sibling, Alto. Chef White trained for several years in Italy and the South of France, where his own love for fish was energized by an environment that embraces seafood, especially fish treated simply. Located on posh Central Park South near Columbus Circle, the dining room was designed by noted Italian architect Franco Rosignolo who also designed another famous NYC Italian mainstay, the original San Domenico. Marea is an homage to Italian design, both classic and modern. The honey onyx wall behind the front bar was handpicked from larger slabs excavated from Imola, Italy. Its appearance is of a perfectly matched abstract impression of sand patterns by the seashore. The Indonesian rosewood paneling was built for the main dining room by expert craftsmen in Emilia-Romagna. Marea is adorned with numerous pieces of modern art that were selected on several visits to Italy to further marry the traditional digs with the contemporary movement. There is no bad seat in the house as every point in the restaurant gives you a full view of the establishment and provides a true cultural dining experience. The only con is that the room can be a bit noisy. Several times this evening I needed to lean in to listen to my dining partner. The service is polished and professional and the responsibilities are well delegated by function. Chef White along with Chef De Cuisine Jared Gadbaw has the catch flown in via FedEx daily. The choices range from fresh crudos of sea urchin, fluke, tuna, sepia, octopus, and blue marlin. The lengthy and impressive wine list is supervised by head sommelier Francesco Grosso. The choices run the gamut from the cutting edge to the safe bets. When Marea wine list was compiled, it would ultimately have over 300 selections which included just about any wine that goes with fish. Naturally, there are loads of whites to pair with the deliciously prepared seafood entrees. A few light reds are added for the alternatives types who favor a good sample of the latter with their seafood. I was also pleasantly surprised to see many affordable selections on the wine list. The food prices, as expected, are not cheap. However, they are not outrageously expensive either. A good value is the $89 four-course prix fixe where you choose one crudo/oysters/appetizer as a first course, a pasta-seafood combo for the second course, and a main seafood entree for the third course (there are also a sirloin steak and guinea hen dish available if you choose), followed by desserts prepared by in house Pastry Chef Heather Bertinetti. Some of the standout samplings on this Friday night were the famous RIcci of sea urchin and lardo crostini ($14); sheer Nirvana, Lobster Ravioli with Chanterelles and Asparagus ($31). The ravioli were delicately sautd9ed and the combination of ingredients just melted in your mouth. My friend Blanca loved her Brodetto di Pesce (Adriatic Seafood Soup), a luscious pool of clams, langoustines, scallops, spot prawns and red snapper cubes ($45). My Branzino ($36), a Tyrrhenian striped bass with marinated salsify, roasted brussel sprouts, fresh pancetta and saba was seared to perfection and embodied all that is Mediterranean. For the finale, I ordered the Mela ($14), a comforting roasted apple and cake combination served with a tart cranberry sorbet. Dinner for two with bottle of wine, tax and 20% tip was $300.', I can see why this place recently earned their first Michelin star. This may be one of the best italian-seafood restaurants I've ever been to, which is great because I'm always looking for new go-to restaurants near Lincoln Center.We did the 4 course prix fixe (definitely the way to go), and got to try:First Course: - Lobster and Butternut squash soup - Calamari filled with spaghetti squashSecond Course: - Agnolatti, veal ravioli with sweetbreads and mushrooms - Scallops and musselsThird Course: - Branzino, wild striped bass - Capesante, porcini dusted scallops with soppressataDessert Course: - Gianduja, Cocoa nib crema, hazelnut chocolate, fior di latte gelato - Polenta Fritta, Crispy polenta with pears and gelatoMost notable were the Agnolatti, Capesante, and the Gianduja. If I went back to Marea I would probably order those again. The Gianduja might be one of the best desserts I've ever had at a NYC restaurant., 'Wow, the food here is great.', One of the best dining experiences of my life, reminiscent of Gary Danko in San Francisco. Such attentive, non-obtrusive service, amazing food with fresh, thoughtful ingredients. The cocktail and bartender were a wonderful start- I'm not sure if there was any tonic in my vodka, however :) Not that I'm complaining. . ., I expected something out of this world from all the rave reviews this place got but wasn't oohing and ah-ing after each and every dish. The highlights of the place was the lobster and cheese appetizer that was so delicate but flavorful that it made every bite seem like heaven. The braised octopus and bone marrow pasta was very comforting to eat. My uni pasta was a disappointment bc it didnt taste like fresh uni at all. It had a weird metallic flavor. The scallops (which our waiter suggested getting) was also a major disappointment bc the mushroom powder it was sprinkled with made it taste bitter and dry. The desserts were just so-so as well. Highlight of the night was definitely the lobster app. I can eat that everyday., This place is located inside a luxury rental building in a high net worth zone. I want to start off by saying that a 30 minute wait for a 9:15pm resy on a Wednesday night is just plain absurd. Either 1) They overbooked or 2) Diners loitered. As we were taken to our table, I noticed that this place reeks of old money, as one would expect. Since I haven't heard ANYTHING bad about this place really, I expected great things. That's where I went wrong. It's not that anything is executed poorly. It just doesn't make you want to crave going back. Grant it, my friend gave a thumbs up to the much hyped fusilli. To their credit, my friend liked his Capesante as well. Didn't get to try the Pat LaFrieda 50day dry aged steak or the $57/lb dover sole (EEK!). I give a thumbs up to the UOVO here. The San Pietro was ok, but the 2 PORK chunks put it over the top. All their pasta is handmade here, which is impressive. BTW, the others were right about the seats. If you spot a seat sans cushioning, you have a non leather seat so I hope you have some meat on your buttocks. Else you are good to go. This place had some Mexicans serving our dishes which is fine, but too bad they sounded like Speedy Gonzales when describing each one. Onto the food. Don't be fooled by the 4pcs of RICCI in the yelp pics, for you only get 2pcs for $15 (not $14 as stated on menupages or their website). I also noticed that the SAN PIETRO is not a Secondi dish available online but is when you get there. Thirdly, I noticed that the seafood risotto has no prix fixe (+$ supp) in person, but does online. They allow you to choose 2 pastas instead of 1 pasta and 1 secondi if you want (my friend did that). Total meal time: 3hrs. Verdict: Indifferent. I want to say 3.5 stars but the price does not justify the wow factor, or lack thereof. I would have paid Convivio prices (4 courses/$59) at this place and given it 4 stars. Tone down the decor, I don't care. I don't want to walk out feeling like I'm paying your rent, and I did. At least the plates and food were hot and the portion sizes were ample, if that matters. If you are a Michael White fan, stick with Alto. Bread: 7 grain, plain, focaccia w/ olive - Not blown away by the Colli Estruschi EVOO Mr White swears by, but the focaccia was great!Amuse: White carrot soup w/ shrimp and garlic chip - served in a shot glass, pace yourself, 1 gulp = tongue burnOrdered:-RICCI ($15) sea urchin , lardo, sea salt - i tried this, way overhyped, don't see what the fuss is about, at least the bread was still chewy and didn't scrape the roof of my mouth, good warm Santa Barbara uni, but for $7.50/pc it better blow me away..or just blow mePRIX FIXE ($89/4 courses) - You save ~10 bucks, skip the prix fixe if you don't eat dessert (~$14/ea)-UOVO (slow poached egg, crispy monkfish cheeks, wild mushrooms, garlic chips) - the highlight of my evening, the flavor of the fungi made this fungi happy, the veggies didn't do anything for me, I think I would rather have had a soft boiled egg though, Ever wonder what they do with the rest of the monkfish? hrmm...-SPAGHETTI (crab, santa barbara sea urchin, basil) - served al dente, if you blindfolded me, I wouldn't be able to tell you uni (or crab) were in this-SAN PIETRO (John Dory, salsify, saba) - skinless, saba is a sweet grape syrup, saba is an oyster tasting root veggie - loved the ribbons of this, good textural balance, the pork saved this dish and made this dish SING!-GIANDUJA (cocoa nib crema, hazelnut chocolate, fior di latte gelato) - imagine a rich hazelnut mousse in rectangular form, good crisp on the bottom, the cow's milk ice cream was very goodTotal came out to $121/pp after everythingPics will be posted soon..., Michelin madness continues to Michael White's 1-star restaurant specializing in coastal Italian seafood. Would this surpass my meals over the summer in Trieste or Venezia? No. Arriving promptly for a 9:15pm reservation on a weeknight we were forced to stand and wait for more than 25 minutes before eventually being seated. Time management is essential in this business. For a restaurant boasting a new Michelin star, I was a little insulted. When we were eventually seated and had ordered, the service began with bread. Having occurred before the Amuse Bouche, this was a noticeable way to stall time. Really, at this hour? And it would not be long before we saw that bread again.Our table of 4 ultimately decided on doing the 4 course prix fixe for $89/person:Amuse Bouche: White carrot soup served with shrimp and a garlic chip. This was served piping hot in a tall shot glass. I liked the texture and flavor of the garlic chip, but I failed to adequately taste the shrimp. Also because it was so hot, great care had to be taken to not burn the fingers, or, worse, one's mouth. The flavor profile was nice though. Appetizer:Ricci. One of the top 10 must eat dishes of the year according to Time Out. My opinion: Time Out doesn't nearly get out to eat as much as I do, as this would never make my top 10 list in any year. Yes it is deceptively simple: crudo and sea urchin on a crostini, but simplicity is not always genius. The crudo looked like cellophane -- not aesthetically pleasing. Being a pure lipid, it was also very slippery, and it easily managed to slip out of my hand while I was eating it. At $7 apiece, you are paying for hype and a portion of the Central Park South rent. But if you are looking for something that is simultaneously salty, crunchy, slimy, and fatty, but otherwise nondescript, you may want to check this one out.1st Course:Ventresca. Bigeye toro tartare with Ligurian olivada and fried capers ($5 supplement). I appreciated that this was served, elegantly, in a small bowl perched over a very large clear bowl of ice. The portion size was large, but the excessive amount of toro did not add much to the dish. I liked how there was a play with flavors in the Italian tradition, but none of the flavors resonated. This was basically a reinterpretation of a simple toro carpaccio. Pass.2nd Course:Agnolotti. Veal ravioli, sweetbreads, and funghi. All of their pasta is made by hand in house. So really any pasta selection is likely to be a delight here -- this one included. The trouble with agnolotti is that it can be a very heavy dish whether rendered through a thick pasta casing or through the overuse of butter in the sauce. I felt a nice delicate balance was achieved here. The pasta was very good. The sweetbreads made for a good filling, and I loved the counterbalance in the earthiness and texture of the mushrooms. The only regret is that the sweetbreads were not identified. I have no idea what I ate. 3rd Course:San Pietro. John Dory served with saba, roasted salsify, and lardons of pork. When was the last time you saw John Dory on the menu? I was pleased to see this selection and quickly decided to order it. Great portion size with lovely colors. This was beautifully prepared. I loved the contrast in textures and flavors. The chewiness of the saba, the fattiness of the pork, rounded out by the freshness of the salsify. The sauce was slight and nuanced. Excellent dish and very respectful use of seafood. 4th Course:Tre Gelati. The three flavors were chocolate, vanilla, and chocolate chip. Really? How unimaginative and pedestrian. The flavors were rich and full, but still short of the great gelati I had all over Trieste. I think their dessert menu really needs to be revamped. Have they never heard of olive oil gelato for example? It seems like a natural choice given how much the chef boasts about his exclusive use of Colli Etruschi olive oil.Mignardises:6 chocolates for exactly 4 people -- a noticeably cheap gesture. Unremarkable chocolate.Overall, a meal with success and failure. The two substantive dishes were done well, but their efforts to round out the menu were dismal. The service was much too slow for a weeknight with us ultimately leaving nearly 30 minutes after midnight. The ambience was generic. This was exacerbated by the white walls, accented with white blinds. Unless this is word play on the chef's name, I fail to see the point of such boring decor. Occasionally though the blinds were punctuated with bursts of color as a few police cars and emergency vehicles made their way down the street while we were dining. Yes, my eyes were so in search for something to look at between courses, that this is what I ended up fixating on. All in, I was out $133 which included 1 cup of coffee. Not the most memorable fare to be had at this price point. If you insist on going to a Michael White restaurant, go to Alto., Chocolate cookie with torrones gelato and cherry compote. Crispy fried polenta with marscapone gelato and almond cookie. It was our first dinner out at a nice restaurant in over a year since we left our jobs, and Marea's $90 pre-fixe was the perfect place to celebrate. The pre-fixe included an appetizer, pasta, fish and dessert. The portions were larger than we anticipated, well seasoned and artfully presented;Antipasto - Monkfish cheeks, toasted bread and soft poached eggPasta - Lobster ravioli with trout roe - so good!Fish - John Dory - two big pieces of tasty fishDessert - Chocolate cookie with torrones gelato and cherry compote - I would love to order all of them.The restaurant was full and we seemed to be the youngest people in the room - most of the patrons were probably far above our income bracket. The staff was calm, knowledgeable and unusually coordinated - it worked like a well-oiled machine, like you would expect an expensive restaurant to be. We asked for and got recommendations for dishes from our calm waitress. We left stuffed, happy and wondering what else New York had in store for us. On our way out, one of the staff handed me a mint chocolate muffin (compliments of the pastry chef) which tasted phenomenal with coffee the next day. Which may be why I had such a lackluster experience at Sushi Yasuda - Marea set the bar. A well deserved 5 stars., 'I was taken here for lunch by an old college friend (it was his payment for me taking his headshots). We started with oysters--the Kumamotos were so fresh and creamy I nearly FELL OUT OF MY CHAIR. We then got a couple dishes of SASHIMI--one was topped with Pomegranite seeds which brightened it up both visually, texturally, and taste-wise. Beautiful. I personally would have plated one of the sashimi dishes (that is totally white) on a dark plate, not a white plate, for contrast, but maybe that just a photographer preference. (I think it was the DENTICE red snapper, whole wheat panzanella but don quote me on that...)We had three pastas--First the MARE acquarello risotto, gulf shrimp, lobster, scallops which I could barely touch it was so rich (or perhaps it was the bottle of bubbly at lunch after 5 hours sleep), but I brought it home with me and it was amazing cold. The FUSILLI durum wheat pasta, red wine braised octopus, bone marrow was to die for. There third pasta we got was the GARGANELLI pasta quills, pork sausage ragu, parmigiano reggiano. Little shell-like rolls of pasta with ground pork in a creamy tomato-ish sauce (yellow in color, see picture). It didn taste BAD, but there was something oddly familiar about it...and then it hit me. Hamburger Helper. Yep. I said it. Hamburger Helper at a Michelin starred restaurant. Now, I don think there anything really wrong with Hamburger Helper. It just not worth eighteen dollars a plate. And there is a new trend in poor man food becoming new and expensive again. (Though it is usually something from the Old Country, not the trailer park.)The service is perfection in every sense. My friend and I were definitely the youngest, hippest people there. Everyone else was men in suits, a couple of gay man dining alone (cause I told straight guys don do that?), old ladies with old money, and one stylish and pretty black news anchor. Our waiter seemed to take into account who we were without losing his (what I expect is quite strict) Marea standards of service.The decor is open and airy, a mixture of corporate style (dark wood, white table clothes) and subtle modernity (see picture of red lampshade chandeliers). (Can you tell I the daughter of an interior decorator.)The lunch is actually a somewhat good deal, but I only go there again on someone else dime (which isn saying much since I such a...frugalista!).Dinner here is sure to impress anyone. Just shy of 4 stars for me. 3.75', 'Excellent Italian Seafood! House-made Bacala with beets and polenta was heavenly! The Monkish cheeks were tasty as well as the Branzino. Ending the meal with Chocolate panna cotta was perfect! Excellent service, great wine list, comfortable setting. I will be back!Expect to pay for a 4 course dinner with wine around $150 including tip. Well worth it!', The newly opened Marea has already earned itself a Michelin star and a 3 out of 4 stars from the NY Times. Mike White's latest Italian outpost in Midtown is filled with business men and wealthy families paying top dollar for Italian fare. Marea is the seafood option of Mike White's 3 New York Italian restaurants (the other two are Alto and Convivo, both have at least one Michelin star). The setting is gorgeous, the restaurant is filled with Rosewood paneling and the crudo bar is made of Egyptian Onyx. The service is regal to say the least and each staff member treats you as if you are royalty, but then again this is what's expected at a restaurant of Marea's calibur. Marea offers a $38 (I don't know why their website says $34) pre-fixe lunch menu and that is the only way you can order. Each supplement dish is $19 and dessert is not included. That's a shame, dessert was pretty good too. The menu combines refined Italian cooking with seafood (like a mix of Del Posto and Le Bernardin if you will). As an appetizer I ordered the Granchio (crab salad) which was very light and seemed small and feeble at first, but towards the end turned out to be a pretty good appetizer. The crab was seasoned perfectly and the grilled watermelon went well with the dish, it was a great way to start off the meal. As an entree I ordered the Gnochetti. The Gnochetti was prepared with seafood in a light tomato sauce. The Gnochetti was cooked perfectly and wasn't mushy. The seafood was fresh and the like I stated before, the tomato sauce was very light. For dessert I had the Torrone which was two small dark chocolate cakes between almond gelato, which in my case was switched to zabaglione (eggnog) gelato, with a raspberry sauce. This dessert was really great and I wished it came with the pre-fixe menu (but then again Marea has to make its money some how). The dark chocolate cakes were crunchy yet smooth and the zabaglione gelato complemented the cakes perfectly. I really enjoyed my lunch at Marea, more than my lunch at Le Cirque yesterday. Everything from the food to the decor to the service is really great, if not perfect. I'd most certainly return to Marea in the near future!, 'Marea is a very sleek, high end Italian seafood restaurant midtown, that opened a few months ago where the crusty San Domenico once resided. I came here a few months ago for drinks and was impressed by the decor and the bar service. When chatting with the bartender, I told him that it was my first time there and that I lived in the neighborhood. He introduced himself, shook my hand and said welcome to Marea. This was a nice touch as places like this want to make sure they draw on the locals as well as the business crowd and tourists.On my second visit, I had the garganelli with sausage ragu. Oooooh, it was good. We also got the Brodetto Pesce. It was excellent, but at $47, it was pushing the envelope of acceptability. The service at the table was excellent, the pace of the meal was great as well. Overall, an excellent dining experience.', 'Yelpers got it right , again ...', 'Full review with pictures in the blog:Arriving before the first dish was a selection of breads to go with that same beautiful olive oil that is offered at Convivio and Alto - on first pass the breads included a chewy and acidic sourdough and a relatively non-descript poppy seed white. Later visits revealed another bread, however - and absolutely sublime Olive and Garlic Forcaccia with a texture like a Detroit-style pizza crust and great top notes of garlic acting as a foil to the potent whole olives. Watching the bread man walk the room I realized quickly why this option hadn been available on the first turn - he ran out every single time he came out with it.To begin my proper meal I had inquired as to whether one of the more famous items from the dinner menu could be made at lunch. Without even checking with the kitchen my server confirmed that it certainly could be, either in a full $14 or half $8 portion. Selecting the single taste as I wanted to maximize my experience I was soon delivered a single Ricci - Sea Urchin, Lardo, Sea Salt on toasted bread. Featuring exactly what was promised the small dish arrived and featured creamy fresh urchin topped with glassy and thin lardo and textural sea salt on a toasty piece of bread. Simple, delicious - a great example of what high end ingredients can do when accented simply. I not sure that $8 a piece is exactly a bargain for this dish but it is definitely something worth tasting if you love uni.The first item from my $19/course tasting was CALAMARI - shrimp and spaghetti squash filled, tomato compote, parmigiano-reggiano. Small in portion but potent in taste I have to say that this dish was good but not great. While the calamari was perfectly fresh and the tentacles just mildly pan crisped, I personally felt the tomato compote significantly overwhelmed the nuances of the shrimp/spaghetti squash stuffing and could have used a bit less acidity in order to let the sweeter aspects of the dish shine. I had originally thought twice about this dish but opted for it when I realized the target of my desire from the online menu was not on the current menu.More olive bread followed the Calamari and mere moments passed before I was brought my first pasta - SPAGHETTI - fresh cut semolina pasta, crab, santa barbara sea urchin, basil. For those who haven noticed, the combination of crab, uni, and pasta is more or less a guaranteed order for me - Alto, Convivio, Scarpetta, Marea (and later A Voce.) Cooked slightly past al dente this dish unfortunately suffered the same fate as the Calamari in that the seafood tastes were again overwhelmed by the acidity of the tomatoes and the flavors that did peak through were only a small degree of brine. Having expected Marea to put out a superior version to that of Convivio I have to say I liked both the pasta and the sauce/protein admixture better over at Tudor Place. Annoyingly, when my server asked me how I liked the dish and I commented that the tomatoes really overwhelmed the seafood his only reply was oh, well, a lot of folks really seem to like that one - youl love the next one, though.A short time passed before my next dish arrived and, well, my server was right - as are all the critics. Titled FUSILLI - durum wheat pasta, red wine braised octopus, bone marrow this dish has become a signature for the restaurant and is rivaled by few as the most unique and impressive pasta dishes Ie tasted. Flawlessly al dente noodles and octopus with top notes of alcohol and cherries with nearly the same texture simply melt into a smooth and creamy taste that really has to be experienced to be described. Pulling the dish together is a creamy and exceedingly non-acidic sauce with salty unctuousness of marrow providing a beautiful foil to the flavors of tomatoes, basil, and parsley.Finishing the small but hearty pasta courses I declined coffee but decided to browse the dessert menu given my previous experiences with Heather Bertinetti confections - and lo and behold, bread pudding. Entitled Budino Di Pane - Ginger Beer Bread Pudding, Poached Quince, Caramel Gelato this dish was nothing like previous budinos or bread puddings, but rather three small heavily ginger/molasses accented cakes sitting atop rum poached quince and ginger-quince puree with a side of bitter-sweet caramel gelato and a crispy tuille. Good, but not as delectable as the desserts at other White restaurants and certainly not as tasty as the Bouchon Ginger Cupcake I pass on this one in the future and get something chocolate.', Michael White's Marea has firmly established itself as one of the city's fine dining restaurants that's here to stay, counting as equals Daniel, Jean-Georges, Bouley, et al. I went here with friends and had a wonderful time. The food is truly incredible. To start, I had the Astice (nova scotia lobster, burrata, eggplant al funghetto, basil). Tender lumps of succulently sweet lobster coalesced with creamy burrata set the bar pretty high for the dishes to come. Luckily, and to my surprise, the second course turned out to be even better than the first - the oft recommended Fusilli (red wine braised octopus, bone marrow). Taste buds in shock by the robust flavors overwhelming them, I was certain that nothing else could surpass this masterpiece. Following the dish eliciting sheer ecstasy, the Capesante (procini dusted sea scallops, braised leeks, celery root, soppressata, crustacean sugetto) came close but no cigar. Don't misunderstand, the scallops were supremely delicious but were unfortunately eclipsed by the nonpareil of pasta dishes.As for drinks, I recommend consulting with their sommelier or simply request the wine pairing with your meal - it is definitely worth it! Their bubbly is quite nice, too!, Ate at Marea for Brunch but I would have gone back to try their dinner menu had we not had reservations at some of the other swanky high end restaurants in NY to try. First, the service is right on as it should be at these restaurants. They grabbed our coats at the door and since we had reservations, they were ready to seat us as soon as we got our coats situated. The water glass was never empty and the fresh bread they brought around was warm and timely. I have to mention that their plates and setting was just absolutely gorgeous, perfectly set for the italian and seafood to come. Kudos for not missing the details. I wish I could remember the names of the dishes I had but they change it often anyways so it won't be like you can order what I had unless you go in January 2010. I started with a crab appetizer that had apple, cheese and a bunch of other lovely tastes incorporated. It was fresh, light and tasty. For the entree, I had the scallops. Of course I only got 3 but those 3 were perfectly cooked and delish. My friend had the pasta and wowwwww......the home made pasta with lamb neck meat was a home run. I wish I had ordered that. Definitely still think about the amazing meal I had at Marea and can't wait to eat there again...hopefully soon., 'Excellent seafood!.....great sevice and I will definitely come back for more.', More like 3.5 starsIf you're looking for a classy place to have a fancy lunch or dinner, Marea is your place. The atmopshere is definitely a bit stuffy, but the service is on point and attentive.I selected a primo of geoduck with chilis and salt and a secondi of the famous fusilli with bone marrow and octopus. The primi was good and light. The serving size was small, but it was very yummy. The taste was crisp and the fresh with just a hint of salt.Our meal was timed very well and shortly after, my pasta arrived. The fusilli pasta itself was a great texture and consistency. The sauce was amazing with chunks of bone marrow mixed throughout giving the sauce a slightly chunky and creamy texture. The pieces of octopus were extremely tender and added a little bit of seafood flavor to dish. It was one of the best pasta dishes I've had.I would definitely come back here to try some of the other options on the menu, but it gets 3.5 stars for the slightly small portion sizes., Marea is a refreshing update to the former San Domenico space at Central Park South. They have an updated bar space that is bright and friendly serving good cocktails. Service in the dining room was attentive but bordered intrusive. I couldn't go more than 2 sips into my water before someone came by to refill the 2oz of liquid that had been displaced. Others had recommended the Ricci plate, sea urchin topped with lardo, sea salt on crostini, but I was disappointed by it. The sea urchin lacked the freshness I expected from a Michael White restaurant. The color was dull, the texture of the sea urchin was thin and flavor was washed out.Oysters however were a completely different experience. They serve an extremely fresh variety of east and west coast oysters, including Beausoleil from New Brunswick, Canada. Don't miss out.Seafood pastas abound at Marea. The Mare risotto is well executed but not something to write home about. The Spinosi, served w/ langoustines in a tomato, basil sauce was memorable. Very good balance of flavor and the langoustines were fresh, perfectly cooked and provided a nice sweetness to the plate. You might get dirty looks for doing so but definitely suck out the brains.My entree was forgettable, the Brodetto di pesce, a seafood soup with clams, langoustine, scallop, spot prawns, snapper just didn't do it for me. Flavors were flat, prawns were overcooked. Next time I'm going for the whole fish., 'I can now say that I know what a $14 dessert tastes like. Yes, it not something to do all the time, but it sure was worth it. I should probably start from the beginning. I arrived about five minutes late for my 2:15 reservation, which luckily wasn a problem (damn R train). The staff was welcoming, but not overly friendly. I like that, because most of the time when a host(ess) or waiter/waitress is too friendly, it quickly turns to fake-friendly, which is just annoying. But anyway, the staff was professional and attentive.I ordered the grilled octopus and acquarello risotto (with shrimp, scallops, and lobster). The octopus wasn prepared the same way as specified on the menu online, so I can give an exact description. I do remember that it had cous-cous, some form of apricot, and something tangy, perhaps balsamic vinegar. The octopus was nothing short of amazing. It was tender, and not the slightest bit fishy. I don think it would be accurate to call it meaty, so Il just say that it was incredibly tender and delicious (aside from the end, which was a bit crispy, you could cut it with a fork).The risotto was good, but not nearly as good as the octopus. Perhaps if I hadn had chosen a different appetizer, I would have thought the risotto was great. The small pieces of seafood were soft, but not mushy, and retained their individual flavors. This was not a risotto where all of the seafood tasted the same.I wasn sure about ordering dessert, because I was already full (a comfortable full, not stuffed) and I knew that they provided petit fours. Well, I ended up choosing the gianduja, accompanied by cocao nib crema, hazelnut chocolate, and fior di latte gelato. It was creamy, chocolatey, nutty, and delicious, with just the right amount of crunch. If you like chocolate and hazelnut, trust me and order this. Just a few more things:- The pre fixe lunch is $38, not $34 like it says on the menu online. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning.- The petit fours were much better than standard. I usually view petit fours as a nice gesture, but disappointing. The linzer tarts were delicious, and I don usually like raspberry desserts. Same with the mini carrot cake.', There was so much hype about Marea when it first opened that I had to try hard not to let my expectations balloon out of control, which is what happened to me at Convivio only a few days before eating at Marea.First off: the space is beautiful. Decor is warm and welcoming, but has enough of an edge to it to be special. The service was something else: nowhere else but Chez Panisse and Gramercy Tavern have I experienced the perfect balance of helpfulness, terseness, and friendliness.But we all know that the only thing that matters is the food.Porkchop and I tried the following: ricci (given my love for sea urchin, I was NOT blown away by this. the lardo was too overpowering, and the texture was a little awkward), vongole (yumyumyumyum. geoduck clam. YUM), kumamoto oysters (I had eaten lunch at the GC Oyster Bar, and the oysters here were by FAR superior), astice (phenomenal. lobster + burrata = heeeeeeeeaven), fusilli (also wasn't a big fan of this hit dish... too salty and sour), and spaghetti (I think I should stop ordering uni pasta... it never tastes how I think it should, except at Esca). For dessert we had the affogato (espresso + licorice + ice cream), which was the perfect end to such a heavy meal.All in all, a positive experience, but I was disappointed by the pastas. It ended up being a little under $150 pp, including a glass of wine each., 'Marea may be Michael White most glamorous restaurant located on Central Park South at the old San Domenico site. The ambience around the bar is enhanced by slabs of Egyptian translucent pink onyx....the restroom floors and walls were enhanced by rosewood ....I mention these things because the 4.5 million dollar decoration tab(hearsay) will no doubt be reflected in your food tab which in our case was more than $285/two which included the least expensive wine available...if you have the money.... treat yourself to to Marea...but make certain your taste buds are in working order...Unfortunately I had a minor cold;and as such may have missed out on some of the more complex nuances of Michael White creations. ...My companion tells me that her grilled octopus and her lobster ravioli were winners ...she was fairly neutral about her John Dory.....My stuffed calamari was interesting ,but my spaghetti with sea urchin /crab was hands down my winner of the night...the Adriatic fish soup was swarming with all sorts of sea life ( formerly )..the shell fish was fresh , but the manila clams were only decorative and not entirely opened and served the same purpose as the rosewood floors ...the broth was interesting but blunted by my cold..the fresh fish in the broth may have been halibut,and served a purpose by just being there...our desserts were the memorable Gianduja and the tart lemon panna cotta which adequately punctuated our 4 course prixe fixe extravaganza., but the gelato was only a 2 out of 5 ...our service gets 5 stars...The staff was charming, helpful. patient and sincerely polite...but at these prices they better be. As a bonus they also sent us home with the world best muffins. The multigrain bread was a winner.. BOTTOM LINE: May not return for dinner because Esca serves the same purpose with much less cost...would try Marea for lunch when my tastebuds return...but White Convivio and Alto in my opinion were overall more satisfying .', Yum! Just ate here for lunch and it was really delicious. The decor is really clean and simple and they have fun comfy chairs (mine had a zipper on it!)You can pick an app and a main course so I went for the Lobster Butternut Soup which was DIVINE. It had lobster butter in it too which made it all the more delicious. PLUS they do that thing where they have the soup in a separate pitcher and pour it in the bowl at the table. For the main I selected the semolina spaghetti with crab and sea urchin - so delicious. The pasta was very fresh and they topped it with a little bit of basil which helped bring out all the flavors. I also tried my friend's dish which was their signature pasta - Fusilli with braised red wine octopus and bone marrow. GREAT. Do not be put off by the 8 legged creature or bone marrow - it tasted amazing and did not have any degree of grossness to it. Dessert was also excellent - my favorite was the Gianduja - which was cocoa creme nibs (yum!) and hazelnut chocolate - it was smooth but the nibs gave it some crunchiness and texture. Definitely recommended. If you're seeing a show or something on the west side, this is a great place to try., Wow! Can I just say wow, cuz: WOW!! This place is the ultimate for me. Just ate here for the first time, for a lunchtime celebration. From beginning to end, everything was impeccable! I cannot say enough. Thanks to Jordan S. for the great reco and leading me to this gem of a restaurant! The decor was right up my alley, modern and contemporary, but not cold and sterile feeling. This was thanks to the warm red tones of the wood and the lighting. Plus, the chairs were super comfy. Love that it's prixe fixe, makes it a great choice when going out with a group. I ordered the Polipo for my app. Cooked to perfection, the flavor was amazing. Served over cous cous with pine nuts and olives, this was a delight for my tastebuds!While we were waiting to order our entrees, a server came around to offer us bread. There were three different options, but I don't know what the other 2 were, cuz my eyes zeroed in on the one that had olives bake right into the dough. Crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside, this olive-oil enhanced carbo-delight was so yummy, I indulged in not one, not 2 but THREE pieces!!!For my entree I got the Mare: risotto with lobster, shrimp and scallops. I mean, that stuff was like buttah! The serving sizes are on the smaller side (in fact, I believe they are actual serving sizes rather than the behemoth sizes we Americans are used to getting at restaurants). Anyhow, when I ordered my entree, I knew I wanted some wine with it, but didn't really know what I wanted. The waitress was able to make some great recos, and I wound up getting the a rose that went perfectly with the Mare. She did the same for my friend who ordered the John Dory. So among the three of us, we each had our own entree and then ordered a fourth to share. That was the rigatoni which is prepared with a shrimp ragu. In a word: divine. I couldn't believe what I was eating! And the nice thing was, because of the smaller plate sizes, I didn't feel stuffed! That is, until after dessert. We ordered 3 to share: Torrino, bread pudding and cheesecake gelato. By far, the best was the cheesecake gelato. I pride myself in being a human thesaurus, but found myself to be quite redundant while eating here. After every bite/sip of something new, I found myself uttering: Amazing!, Overall, the food here is how I'd imagine the food in heaven would taste. My companion and I came to try out the pasta and crudo tasting menu (only available at the crudo bar I believe) and added on the sea urchin and crab pasta (incredibly unnecessary). The pasta and crudo tasting menu is the perfect amount of food and you will be full by the time dessert arrives not because of the lack of food but due mainly to their knack for the spacing between courses. The one minor misstep was the lack of service to start the meal but this was corrected over the course of the meal. Back to the food...Crudo:Pacific snapper (incredible first bite in a distinctly Italian preparation; tomato enhanced the flavor of the fish)Cuttlefish tagliatelle (interesting flavor but my least favorite of the crudo)Geoduck (great texture and flavor but probably preferred the fish to shellfish crudo served during the menu)Marlin (absolute perfection)Tuna (the bite that gives you a bit of everything and makes you wish you could snack on this at any time)Mackerel (pomegranate and duck proscuitto gave you a bit of everything; my least favorite of the fish but other diners rated this their favorite preparation)Now on to the fun part...the PastasFerratini w/ clams (probably could have done without this very light preparation but at any other restaurant would have been asking for more; chili worked well giving it a little spice and bread crumbs gave it some crunch; also the squid was a nice addition)Rigatoni w/ shrimp (best pasta I have tasted since my first bite of langoustine risotto at Il Mulino back before it was sold; this is definitely on my short list for my last meal of my life; cream sauce with parmesan and shrimp)Lobster ravioli (great preparation w/ salmon roe and a cream sauce that was better than any pastas I've had recently outside of Marea)Fusilli w/ octopus and bone marrow (outstanding and if I was a tomato sauce guy, this would have been my favorite; the sauce is incredible)Veal ravioli (although the sweetbreads are as good as it gets, the pasta was a bit too salty with an incredibly runny filling; probably could have done without this dish as it was also a bit heavy; pasta was still better than any pasta I've had at Babbo)Sea urchin spaghetti (amazing although I'd probably switch up the crab for shrimp or lobster; would definitely have this again)Dessert:Torrone and gelatos are incredible and not to be missedBottom Line:Amazing restaurant for special occasions, business dinners or if you've got too much in the bank.Will definitely be back as many times as those three situations permit me in the future and hope that the restaurants around long enough for me to take full advantage of that menu.Marea is definitely a sign that big and bold is back in Manhattan and I can't wait to get back here again., There was a lot of question whether NY Times would give Marea 3 or 4 stars. Well it got 3, and after going last night, I'd drop it down to 2. A big part of what makes a good restaurant is the service, and this place was absolutely piss poor at making you feel welcomed.We arrived exactly on time and were made to wait at the bar for 30 minutes. After we sat, we were ignored for another 20 minutes before we were even able to give our order. I had to pled for our waiter to come back. We went with the $89 prix fixe and the wine pairings. Uninspired wine pairings that would often come out 10 minutes after the dish it was supposed to pair with. We only saw the sommelier once, the rest of the night glasses were just deposited at our table with no explanation at all.All of our seafood dishes were MEH. From the sea urchin with lardo, to the geoduck crudo, to the extremely rubbery and dry john dory main course. My girlfriend's cuttlefish was filled with sand and she still finds herself chewing the sand, a day after. If anything, the pasta courses were the star of our meals, but you would probably have a better chance of having good pasta at one of Michael White's other restaurants.I'll put it bluntly: This was the most overhyped restaurant I've ever eaten at. I felt like we got robbed when the check came, quite frankly. This place is not worth the money, the food is simply not good, not inventive, and just plain not worth your time. Eat here if you're a massively rich 70 year old upper east side woman who doesn't give a crap about food., It's between 2 and 3 stars for me depending on how rich you are. The poorer you are, the lower the star just because this place is simply not worth the big bucks. I have a feeling the service is selectively discriminatory in this place. Meaning, if you aren't Jay-Z and Beyonce or Sam Sifton, then you won't be given the same three NY times star service that they most probably received. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't consider any part of our experience at Marea fine-dining at all.Most of the food that we had aside from the pasta was, at best, satisfactory, The food and the service was so bad, I didn't even care to complain because pointing out every fault would just seem too ridiculous to be true and make our day-before-valentine's-day dinner frustrating. I suggest you read my date's review to find the details of what went wrong. (yelp.com/biz/marea-new-y43_)If I were to go back to Marea again, I wouldn't make the mistake of getting the prix-fixe menu with wine pairings. I would just eat at the bar and forego the service expected from a fine-dining waiter and sommelier. I'd grab one of their hibiscus spritzer cocktail to start, jump straight to a pasta dish (my escargot pasta was superb), decide on my own wine pairing, and ask for the check., I really wanted to be blown away by Marea and have a 'great-meal-memory'. Unfortunately, it turned into just a very good experience and only marginally so. We did the 4 course meal. The antipastos were very good, the head-cheese (pig) with anchovies in particular. The Pasta's were excellent (yum ... lobster ravioli with fish roe). However, the main dishes, that should have been the crowning achievement in a seafood restaurant of this caliber, were surprisingly disappointing. We had both the John Lory and the Sea Scallops. Both dishes were fairly simple but not in a way that emphasized the best flavors of the seafood. The dishes just fell a bit flat. After such a fine start, both of us were left thinking wishfully of similar and better main dishes from le Bernardin. Another thing to note is that Marea is very popular right now. Our reservation was on a Saturday night and we waited a half hour past our reservation time. Also, while the service was good, it was not great and I attribute that to how busy they were. Despite all this I do recommend the restaurant to seafood lovers. I think that they do try to reward those who are adventurous in their selections., 'We had a very lovely experience here. Arrived on time for our Friday night reservations, steered to the bar for a quick cocktail, then promptly seated in the main room, which is quite nice.Had some great oysters and apps, then the John Dory and whatever Yelpchick had (so many meals...) A lovely sorbet dessert, etc. All very nice.The service was quick and attentive. The food was great. The atmosphere was superb. Maria Bartiromo was seated next to us, and Oscar de la Renta passed thru chatting with a few tables on his way out.Plus we were given a nice coffeecake to take home at the end of the evening.', Elegant dining. Italian seafood at its finest. Marea was a special evening. The decor is beautiful. Service is spot on and the food was incredible. Their gorgeous dining room was filled with power players and model types enjoying great, yet expensive meals. We had the best table in the house, tucked away in the corner where my ADD was in full flare people watching. The atmosphere was elegant and people were pretty dressed up for the night. So, gents you'll want to sport a suit for this one. The menu is an impressive collection of creative Italian seafood dishes. The first page is full of raw selection, oysters and antipasti to get you started. They brought out a little amuse bouche soup after we ordered, which is always a nice touch and a sure sign of a great meal to come. We began our splendid meal with the Polipo of grilled octopus, inslata di riso, fava and yellow tomato as well as the Granchio of blue crab, grilled watermelon, castelvetrano olives, and mint. Both were excellent and fresh. The octopus was perfectly done, which can be tricky. We both decided on a few of their pastas, which are hand made in house. Cavatelli with red shrimp, controne puree, and rosemary for the lady and Ferrantini with manila clams, calamari, and hot chilies for me. I'm used to pasta servings that seem to be an entire pound. That was not the case here, but they were not lacking at all. There was plenty of seafood in the dishes and they were scrumptious. We had a sweet tooth fix to satisfy and they Marea did not disappoint. Not able to settle on one, we got a few. Torrone-torrone gelato, black cocoa cake and sour cherry compote which was great and also a few gelatos and sorbets. We had cookies and cream gelato and kiwi and pomegranate sorbets. They were all excellent. A fitting finish to a fantastic meal. They also gave us a tasty little banana cake as a parting gift that I made short work of for breakfast the next morning. Upscale dining at its best. Marea was one of the best meals I've had in NYC., I'm a huge fan of Marea. They have a raw shrimp crudo, and an egg and mushroom appetizer that's just to die for. Every course was wonderful, service was excellent., 'The sea scallop entree was transcendent, the service was perfect, the presentation was immaculate. From the freshest crudo to the perfectly al dente pasta and risotto to the intricate desserts, a delicious experience.', 'This restaurant has an elegant dining room featuring an expansive seafood menu with enough turf options to satisfy picky eaters.The crudo are varied, if small. Our table shared a few and enjoyed them all, even the octopus.We also shared a few half-portions of the pastas. I found the seafood risotto to be a little undercooked, but my fellow diners disagreed. My favorite was the fusili with braised octopus and bone marrow. Who thought octopus could be so rich and tender?We all had fish for our main course and everyone was exceedingly pleased. Each piece of fish was perfectly cooked with complimentary and creative sauces and vegetables. The portions were generous.The desserts (we tried 3) were uniformly spectacular, especialy the lemon pana cotta. The small cakes as a parting gift were a nice touch.Highly recommended for a special occasion.', Amazing seafood restaurant. I would go back if it wasn't quite as pricey. Our entire table got the 4 course prix fixe but added the ricci (sea urchin toast that melts in your mouth). Can't remember what crudo I got but it was fantastic.For my primi, I got the spaghetti with uni, crab, and basil. amazing!Then the scallops which were seared perfectly and served with a beautiful sauce., The Fusilli with Red Wine Braised Octopus and Bone Marrow is a transcendent dish - rich, fresh, delicious, and creative - probably the best pasta that I have eaten in the last 2 or 3 years. The Octopus is slightly charred and perfectly chewy; the sauce spicy and addictively tangy; the noodles gorgeously al dente; the soft, large pieces of Bone Marrow included so intuitively, that you feel silly for not having thought of this boisterous combination of smells, textures, and flavors before Michael White. This is heaven on a plate.The rest of the meal is just very good - seamless service, well-executed (if slightly inconsistent) dishes, a mix of selections that alternate between passable and excellent. The excellent included a Spaghetti with Crab, Santa Barbara Sea Urchin, and Basil - a creamy, textually impressive epiphany. The pasta was superbly cooked; the strands and flakes of crab were not overwhelmed by the rest of the plate. If not for the Fusilli, this would have been the highlight. Also delicious were the Geoduck and Branzino Crudo choices - the former garnished with fresh chillis and lemon, the latter with caviar. Crudo Lovers should note that the Fluke and Snapper did not compare in terms of flavor, texture, and taste: we had asked our server to recommend his four favorite - the Branzino and Geoduck were standouts, the other two were duds.Lobster with Burrata Cheese (Astice on the menu) was disappointing. As were the Oysters - not in that any could fairly be described as bad - but just that they were overpriced; with the exception of an absolutely gorgeous Kushi varietal, the mollusk flight didn't really stand out at all.Service was as you would expect - and certainly as you would deserve, with the price tag that Marea carries. Attentive without being overbearing; his Crudo recommendations aside, our waiter was friendly and resourceful. But really, this place is all about that Fusilli for me. What a dynamite dish. I will certainly be back., not sure what i was expecting, but for $89/person for the tasting menu, i was hoping to be blown away. it was definitely good, but not blow my socks off fantastic.the blue crab appetizer was the best part of the meal. very clean, light flavors were spot on. i don't even remember my pasta dish, and my fig scallops were okay. the dessert sorbet was blah blah blah, would definitely get something else next time. not sure i would go there again, or if i did, i would order a la carte and get just a few things as opposed to the tasting menu again., I don't go to very many fancy restauranst, but on occasion I attempt to try something a little different.A friend and I tried Marea last week. We went for lunch and had the prix fixe. The service was attentive, and our waitress was very helpful. She sent the sommelier over when we wanted to confirm our choice of wine for our meal. I had the geoduck appetizer - very tasty and light. For my main course I had the spaghetti with sea urchin - rich and tart at the same time. My friend had the octopus and bone marrow pasta - I tried a bit and it was super delicious. The bone marrow kind of melted in your mouth and the octopus was not rubbery!We finished the meal with some sweets and cappuccino. This atmosphere was very business-y, but that was to be expected. Overall, it was a very nice experience. I would love to go back, but alas, the cost prohibits me....maybe in six months or a year?, Really great experience with amazing decor and tasty food. The lunch is a prix fixe menu for $38. I started with the raw tuna and got the fusilli for my main. The tuna was OK, and I definitely could have gotten better tuna at a sushi restaurant. The fusilli, their signature dish, was very delicious though and made up for the tuna. Extremely flavorful, but not too overpowering. This is also a great place for a business lunch, as it's relatively quiet with a well-lit and elegant ambiance., 'Overall, I was very impressed with Marea- I a big fan of Michael White, having been very pleased with experiences both Alto and Convivio. Was a little wary of what I should expect given that there seemed to be a lot of hype, but happily Marea lived up to expectations. The restaurant space is beautiful- dark woods with pops of red and beautifully accented with stone marble at the bar. Table settings were stunning. I really appreciated that the food wasn served on the standard white china, as I felt that the food was accented by the presentation although the settings didn detract from the food at all. Prix fixe was $89 and included Crudo/Ostriche/Antipasti, Primi, Secondi, and Dolce. Portions were more than generous and we definitely left very full. I got the Polipi- grilled octopus, insalata di riso, fava, yellow tomato, to start and my dining companion had the Baccala- housemade salt cod, heirloom tomatoes, watercress. Both dishes were highlights of the meal. The grilled octopus was cooked to perfection- charred and crisp on the outside and velvety soft on the inside. the accidity in the tomato and fava balanced the sweetness of the octopus well. I expected the salt cod to be heavy in flavor but it was surprising light. Served with a creamy polenta that was pure heaven in your mouth. Bread- outsourced from Sullivan Bakery- you have your choice of the Foccacia with Olives, Sourdough or Seven Grain. I tried the Foccacia and Seven Grain, both of which were delicious and thankfully served hot. Primi- I had the Spaghetti crab, santa barbara sea urchin, basil. I was expecting the pasta to be fantastic after having an amazing experience at Convivio. I was very pleased with the flavors in the dish but less impressed with the pasta itself. Maybe I being picky but the spaghetti was very thin and I felt that the dish would have been enhanced with a slightly wider spaghetti since I never felt that I got a real bite. Flavors were amazing- the dish was light and delicious, with a balanced contrast between the crab and sea urchin, accented by the basil. Overall would go to Convivio for pasta but can complain about the spaghetti either (noted that between the spaghetti at Marea and the spaghetti at Scarpetta, I would offer that Scarpetta edges out Marea in the texture/width of the pasta). Secondi- I was less impressed by the fish entrees. I had the Ippoglosso-seaweed marinated alaskan halibut, sweet corn, spigarelli, manila clams, lardo, chili. My dining companion had the Branzino- seared wild striped bass, marinated salsify, roasted brussel sprouts, fresh pancetta, saba. Presentation was lovely and the fish was cooked well. However, I felt that it somewhat lacked flavor and wasn especially memorable. As for the, Branzino, the skin was crisp and the fish well cooked- the brussel spouts and pancetta accented the texture and flavor of the fish well. Dolce -good but not especially memorable. I had the pistachio cake which was moist and light, and covered with a thin layer of chocolate on top. Well accented with pistachio ice cream and pistachios. I didn think that the accompanying candied kumquats paired well and I wish they had peeled the rinds as they were somewhat chunky (lack of a better word). My dining companion had the Panna Cotta vanilla bean panna cotta lemon verbena sauce, blueberry sorbet, which was absolutely delicious and another highlight of the meal. The panna cotta had the right balance of tartness and creaminess, and the hint of mint really made the dessert pop. A petit fours of chocolates also followed: peanut butter (the filliing was very rich, almost tasted with straight peanut butter), white chocolate with lavender, raspberry and the Marea milk chocolate. Service- service was attentive but not overpowering. Server was knowledgeable and very helpful about the wine pairings, and came by several times to ask us how we were enjoying the meal. Parting gift of a banana bread type muffin was a nice touch. In sum, Marea was a wonderful dining experience. Standouts of the evening were the grilled octopus, spaghetti, and panna cotta. Would definitely go back for another superb Michael White experience.', 'I took my boyfriend here last week for his birthday and it was fantastic. We walked it planning on having one of the tasting menus but our waitress suggested we do the 4 course prix fixe since it was our first time there--said it give us an opportunity to try specific items on the menu. We tried the tonno & astice for apps, fusilli & acnolotti for our pastas and finished with the capesante & ippoglosso (see pictures). Everything was great. Service was also excellent--we never felt rushed even though the restaurant was packed and you could see people waiting to be seated. We also never had an empty glass of wine or water. Overall it was one of my best experiences in a long time.'|2
31|maruya-san-francisco|'Finally a Tokyo-style sushi in SF! I was excited to find out about the opening just a few blocks from my house.I must say I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the fish and the way the sushi was prepared. Not too much rice for the fish, perfect quality rice and perfect amount of soy sauce when served. Much like many of the Tokyo sushi restaurants serving in that style.We sat at the bar with Chef Hide and loved the knife work he performed on the different types of fish. Very traditional and perfectly cut.', '3.5 STARSOne of my most expensive habits is sushi. None of that Kiki or Kitaro IGotTheHersheySquirtsNow crap. Don get me wrong, I use to eat at those places every week when I was in college but once youe tried the good stuff, you really can go back to eating bukkake topped jive ass rolls. What I love about date nights is I get to choose the place for dinner and he just has to show up. Hmmm but after seeing last night bill, I not surprised if he stands me up next week. But anyways, having such an affinity for sushi, I picked Maruya for date night last night. Grand opening on Tuesday, Maruya took over the old Bar Bambino space in The Mission. Parking in this area of the Mission is much easier and I was easily able to find non-metered parking last night. Maruya is a traditional Japanese restaurant serving no CA rolls, no bento boxes, and no teriyaki dishes. You can get any more authentic then that. The Japanese sushi chefs are Sasaki-San (Sebo, Hecho & 2G Japanese Brasserie) and Hide-San. You can order nigiri and sashimi a la carte but the only way to go at an authentic sushi restaurant is omakase. They have two omakase choices: one from Sasaki-San which is a mixture of cold and hot dishes, sashimi and nigiri ($85) or strictly a nigiri and sashimi omakase from Hide-San which ranges in price. There also Moriwase (platter) on the menu that more affordable at $40 for sushi and $45 for sashimi. Here the menu: bit.ly/1etWqod.We requested Nigiri Omakase from Hide-San where the sushi chef will continue feeding you until you tell him to stop. BEWARE: unlike other sushi restaurants, Maruya charges by the piece and NOT by the pair so your tab will quickly add up. One uni nigiri for example is $7 which is very expensive IMO for the area. For those familiar with Akiko in the FIDi, the prices are pretty similar so expect to spend about $100+ for the Hide-San omakase. More if youe a hungry and less if youe not. Our 22 piece nigiri omakase was about $113 pp.The complimentary Sunomono which is a mixture of lightly pickled veggies: bit.ly/1etZoZV was a nice start to our omakase dinner. *Omakase Part 1: bit.ly/1gOcFynBlue Fin Tuna, Big Eye Tuna, Scottish Salmon, Kinmedai (Golden Eye Tai), Hamachi (Yellowtail), Hirame (Fluke), Sanma (Mackerel Pike), Ebodai (Butter Fish) & Kurodai (Black Sea Bream)*Omakase Part 2: bit.ly/19TWlZMSaba (Mackerel), King Salmon, Kampachi (Amber Jack), Mirugai (Geoduck), Kamasu (Barracuda), Big Tuna Chu Toro, Blue Fin Chu Toro, Blue Fin O-Toro & Uni (Sea Urchin)*Omakase Part 3: bit.ly/19UdX9WIkura (Salmon Roe), Ankimo (Monkfish Liver), Hotate (Scallop) & Tamago (Sweet Egg Omelet)Collectively, the fish selection provided was some of the best AND freshest Ie ever had. You can tell that the fish was flown in from Japan that day as each piece tasted like it was freshly plucked from the ocean; oh so buttery and silky. There were four standouts of the night. First, were the toros with the king of all toros (O-toro) being so phucking good we had to get two orders of. Then, there was the insanely creamy uni with a fluffy texture which unlike any uni Ie ever had; and this is coming from a uni whore. Next, the foie gras of the sea, Maruya ankimo was so spectacular that it rivals Ino. Lastly, was the tamago. I usually not big a fan of tamago but Maruya was so delicately sweet that it sufficed as a dessert.IMO, top-notch fish which Maruya has should be eaten naked. They don provide any soy sauce or wasabi. Instead, they dab a bit of wasabi onto each nigiri and then brush housemade sauces that best accompany the fish. While this is the traditional way of preparing sushi, I think Hide-San got too sauce happy as he heavily lacquered a majority of our nigiri which completely masked the clean ocean taste. Considering that their shari was already very well-seasoned, the over saucing ruined the integrity of the fish. Since each piece averaged about $6-7, it was a complete disappointment on that end. Our omakase ended with a complimentary shot of their Yuzu Lemonade which was so refreshing: bit.ly/1gOcFyn. They should consider offering this on their drink menu as there currently no non-alcoholic options; not even soda.Service was very polite and attentive as one would expect from most traditional sushi restaurants. Our water glasses never went empty which is always a good sign. Just like their food, the ambiance was minimalist in design with lots of wooden cabinetry, tables, and furniture. Reservations are highly recommended as there only 10 seats at the sushi bar, and 8 two-top tables in the dining area. Although the fish quality was spectacular, I can only give Maruya 3.5 stars because of the over saucing of the fish and the very high prices for the area (rounding up for their grand opening).#RamenBowlsForTheRestOfTheWeek', Wow. Truly excellent sushi restaurant. I really liked Bar Bambino and I'm happy to see a great restaurant like Maruya take over the space. The fish was very fresh and nicely presented. My wife and I had a great experience! We didn't sit at the bar since we had our one year old in tow, but that's where I'll be sitting next time., This is simply the best Japanese restaurant in the city. I don't know enough adjectives to describe how amazing the Omakase was. And, the service was attentive and warm. The atmosphere was incredible. I stayed for 4 hours and loved every second of it., 'I fly to Japan at least 1-2 times a year, no excuse is needed, but really just for the food. This place is as close you get to Japan without the jet-lag and foreign transaction fees. No need for pictures. Go here. Have whatever is in season and whatever the chef suggests. Colorful rolls with fancy names need not apply. Fish, nihonshu, fish, nihonshu.', Always on the hunt for great sushi. Maruya is good, if you like particular types of fish, I would just order ala carte. In between a 3 and a 4 for me, feeling generous today.Favorites of the evening:-Chutoro-Seared halibut fin, so smoky-Shima aji-Uni and soft tofu-DessertsLove the flexibility of the chefs, I wanted to have chef provide his sushi selections from the Hide's course, but also wanted to see their appetizers and vegetables. Asked and we received the Masa's course. They brought all the appetizers and split them between the two of us. We had 19 pieces of sushi between the two of us. Sake, Hide's course, Masa's course and two desserts came out to $400 for two. Service is good, standard polite Japanese. It was odd they didn't bring a warm towel at the start of the meal. I liked how they would switch out our entire cup of tea for a new one, probably because they wanted to regulate the temperature. The cup however, was very hot to the touch, so one cannot drink immediately. Overall, the experience was good. I especially loved the desserts. Lovely matcha tiramisu, fluffy cream and not overly sweet. The matcha latte and the cocoa dusted mocha squares were perfectly done and satisfying. Some of the sashimi was drowning in yuzu and a few of the sushi selections were overly firm fish, which I am not particularly fond of. I have had much better maguro. Special occasion restaurant, some interesting unique fish, great desserts., The sushi here is fantastic. And that's all I'll say about that, since you'll be hearing it ad nauseum here. Arguably from many people who know squat about Japanese cuisine, yes, but now I'm already getting off track.No, I'm going to comment on the hospitality here. O-Mo-Te-Na-Shi. (Accompanied by little hand gesture. Ask your Japanese friends about this obscure Tokyo Olympics reference.)Two things that really stood out for me during our visit: They've installed little hooks under the sushi counter, so you can properly store your handbags without them touching the floor. Whenever a staffer goes into the restroom, they re-fold the toilet paper ends into a little triangle (like hotel housekeeping does), and re-stack the fabric hand towels into a nice pyramid.This point (2) was striking. I just never, ever, ever see this kind of attention to detail in the US. Let alone at restaurants. This is genuine spirit of hospitality, and attention to detail, folks. As a non-Japanese Asian American, I concede defeat to this execution, because we just don't have this in our blood.Speaking of details, pay attention to the sushi counter and its construction. Absolutely remarkable., If you like sushi, this restaurant is for you. The best way to eat here is at the bar, omakase, with Hide's course. Chef Hide will prepare a selection of delicious and very fresh sushi and sashimi till you're full. There is no fish case separating you and the chefs, which means you get to watch as they slice, dice, and roll your fish - it adds a lot to the experience. The food and the ambiance are top notch and quite pricey. Not all expensive restaurants are worth it, but this one definitely is., One of the best meals I've had in SF.Note - we had a 9:30 pm reservation and they in fact asked us to leave at midnight :), AMAZING sushi!!! Couldn't wait to come here after hearing so many good things about this little hidden treasure in the Mission. First impression: I was speechless! My husband and I both ordered Hide's course (he wanted more nigiri and I asked for mostly sashimi) everything was exceptional. Hide's course came with some starters: seaweed with cucumber, tofu with truffle and the name of a fish I forget topped with green onions and truffle oil. The meal ended with a mushroom miso soup and an amazing dessert ( the wagashimochi with matcha milk tea is a MUST! ) The restaurant's interior is very stylish, reminds me of many sushi restaurants I've been in New York. The hostesses and waiters are very professional! I will definitely be back! This place is impressive!, After Sebo's sad closing, this is the best sushi place in the city. That's all you need to know., Layout of restaurant is odd. When you first walk in, there's a desk where you check in. If your table isn't ready, you walk through the restaurant and there's a small waiting are with just 2 stools and a counter past the bathroom in the back. They will bring your drinks back there so feel free to order away. I had tea which was perfectly brewed and super hot!With that said, the restaurant is gorgeous. The cabinetry behind the sushi bar is beautiful, sharp, modern and functional. I saw the chef taking the blowtorch from one of them.We both had masa's omakase ($85 pp) and it was fabulous! It took a few dishes to get to the fish dishes (trio of homemade tofu, mountain peach-berry/chestnut/gingko berries, poached tomato in broth). Grilled salmon with skin was delish! However, it's the sashimi and nigiri that really shine here! Every fish we had here were phenomenal! We also ordered some bass sashimi because we were still a little hungry.Service is the tops. I had to ask for more tea at first but after that, they were on the ball and bringing me more tea regularly. There were times that I couldn't understand what they were saying when describing our dishes but the food is excellent and they take good care of you here.There is only 1 bathroom and it was cleaned at least once during our dinner. I only know this because the ends of the toilet paper was folded into triangle after they tidied it up. They have paper towels as well and washcloths which were always neatly stacked., 'I was kinda disappointed for the price.yes, presentation is pretty and they seem to take a long time for everything.service was slow but i willing to look past that since they are a fairly new restaurant.the quality of the fish was.... fishy.they put all the fish together in a metal container. all the sashimi pieces were touching each other. they also put all the tuna variety in one wooden looking box.maybe that why everything tasted fishy. the different types of fish were in the same box and touching. Ordered Hide Omakase which is just sashimi and nigiri.the first three dishes weren sushi/sashimi.vegetable, followed by soft silky homemade tofu (similar in consistency to chawanmushi) , then Kumamoto oyster. Strangely, the oyster wasn sweet.Had 17 courses of sushi/sashimi and nothing I can say was outstanding or good. So we decided to just end it after 17. I believe they had over 30 different kinds of fish that night. I just couldn go on.The last nigiri was miso marinated mozzarella, which i didn enjoy either.There miso soup in the end which I didn really enjoy. And you finish with a yuzu sparkling ade. Which I thought was just Ok.Overall, it was disappointing. If this is one of the best sushi places in this city, then San Franciscans are definitely missing out!', 'Must try for any foodie. This is absolutely the best sushi spot in SF. The price is the only downfall, so it is better to order off the set menu, because they offer the best pieces of fish. Do make sure to call in and make a reservation!', In a vacuum, five star as a foodie experience for the $85 omakase tasting menu -- the preparation is deliberate and tastes very refined. No bashing you over the head with flavors and spices, you taste amazing ingredients and nuances that I love in Japanese cuisine. The sashimi and sushi is some of the best quality I've had in SF. And they've done an amazing job with the space Four star because compare it to what you can get in SF for a great meal, Maruya feels a tad overpriced despite the delicious meal. Great but not out of this world exceptionalWe had four in the party, all $85 omakase, a round of Sapporo draft plus wine/sake at $25 corkage fee each, and two desserts to share, and came out to about $120 per person., i wish this place has bomb sushi! but it doesn't. we are more than willing to pay big bucks for awesome sushi but for what we paid for $825 for 3 people with only 2 bottles of sake (almost $100 for each bottle) and 2 beers, I want damn good sushi rice! The temperature of the rice was very inconsistent. When a new batch came out from the back, the temperature was slight warm, perfect texture. But after that one piece, the temperature of the rice dropped and became cold and harder. They need to do something with the front door being so closed to the sushi bar and whenever the door opens, the cold draft chills the room and the RICE!! Or have a warmer to keep the rice at a consistent temperature. Another problem was we were served with so many pieces of the same type of fish, ie. 4 different kinds of tuna, 3 different kinds of hamachi, etc. Come on!!! I want varieties! If i want more tuna, we can go back and select some other tuna cuts we didn't have. By the time we were served with other fish, like anago, uni, etc., i was too full to have more. I understand to let the rice and fish to shine when the ingredients are great but it was way too straight forward to be just fish, rice and a slight brush of the soy on top of the fish. It's missing something. I like sushi ran for a reason bc they let the rice and fish to shine but they are also creative to make some of the fish shine even more with sea salt or a hint of lemon juice. I don't think we will return to maruya anytime in the near future (or ever) unless something is changed. Why I am giving it two stars instead of one? The wood pieces everywhere in the restaurant are amazing!!!, Aw crap - what hit my taste buds? Awesome??This place was pretty amazing. Party for my palette and celebration for my appetite. This spot for sushi was SO good.I've traveled all over the states and to Japan as well - I can say this place is top notch (November 2013). Yes, pricey. But that's quality. The sushi making style was pretty legit. For instance, the amount of rice that you would receive with Nigiri pieces should be slight, with the slice of meat covering most of it.Personal highlight, they serve REAL wasabi. Not the powder (crap). Oh yes.Service is friendly though my server could have been a little more on top of things.Love, love, loved the interior design and decor. Simple, rustic-modern-polished. The lights could use a little dimming for the hour (8 or 9 pm) - just a suggestion as I have no complaints about Maruya.I'm hungry reflecting on my dining experience here.If you want bar seating, you'll have to make reservations. Less than 2 months new but already popular. I fear being able to get seats in the future - awesome joint and I look forward to returning., 'The sushi is fantastic and for the price, it better be.The music is boring, the seats near the windows are freezing, and the service is poor.The waiter took 15 minutes to even acknowledge we had been seated. I had to repeatedly ask for his attention and when we ordered two glasses of Sake, he poured one and walked away.Overall, four stars on food due to extremely high pricing, two stars on ambiance, and two stars on service. I was hoping for more.', I live in the Peninsula so there's a lot of great Japanese restos. But this is definitely the best Japanese resto in SF. Their $85 Omakase definitely worth getting, their sashimi and nigiri are amazing, the masa omakase comes with grilled fish and everything was super tasty. The ambiance and service was excellent, definitely worth coming back!, The only thing worse than bad fish is a lot of it!Let me start at the beginning. Just 1 door down from Maruya, was an old guy lying in the fetal position flat out on the sidewalk. In the doorway he had 2 shopping carts full. It was so cold and he had nothing but his clothes between him and the cold, hard sidewalk. I spent the next 2 hours chiding myself for not laying my jacket on top of him. Thankfully by the time we left, he was sitting up with his carts in the doorway so I got to keep my flimsy jacket. By this time, after sitting almost 2 hours next to Maruya's windows, I was so freezing myself thru and thru.We enter the restaurant and get shown to a table. I object. I had noted on my OpenTable reservation I had made way in advance that we wanted the bar. I had been one of the first to make a reservation for this night as so many times were still available, why wouldn't my request be honored? Plus after reading how cold certain bar seats got by being by the door, I had actually emailed them with a picture of the bar with a red X marking the seats I was requesting. Well, I was told so sad too bad, they do not read the notes from OpenTable or their emails.I can't remember ever not eating at the bar at a sushi restaurant. We have sushi at least once a week every week for the last 32 years, we love it that much. My husband said I would now not like anything all night and he was so right. But as it turned out, he didn't like much either!We did the $85 omakase, Masa's course, which it seemed to me was all made in the kitchen. So why it has the chef's name, I am unclear. Definitely not the way to go if seated at a table.A gal came in and sat at the bar right behind us. She had on a strong perfume. I cannot tell you how much strong perfume and not so great raw fish do not mix.Nothing was special, nothing was inspired. NO PREMIUM FISH; no toro, no belly cuts served in the $85 omakase! I wonder if Saturday night is not the night to go seeing as they are closed on Sunday and Monday. Maybe they were out of the good fish or saving it for the bar. First out a trio which had 2 half's of a mini carrot and 2 mini, mini radishes in a parmesan dipping sauce. 2 pieces of maguro sashimi that seemed to me had been cut much earlier. Slimy came to mind. And a very small, warm (good part) cup of tofu with uni on top. It was like a poor relative of chawanmushi. Next came out a skinless yellow tomato that had been blanched, served warm. Well, being late December, great tomatoes are long gone. Odd came to mind. Next came the best course, a small serving of Miso Black Cod. Though Roka Akor had a much better version.A 3 fish sashimi dish appeared. I ate 1 piece of each fish and then paid my husband to eat the rest. Not great.Then the sushi started appearing all from the kitchen I do believe. None from their A game for sure. The fish served at the bar might be a totally different story, but the fish served to us was not great. Now I admit, I am so spoiled as far as sushi/sashimi goes. Just last night, we had the best ever fish at Koo in the Sunset. This fish at Maruya just was flavorless, some odd textures, some feeling slimy to my tongue. The best piece was of maguro. (Oddly we were served maguro in 3 different courses, the first 2 were not great). I am too old and too onery to gag down fish that is not enjoyable, so if my husband told me ick, I didn't even try it. Not that any of the fish was bad, it just was not good.They do not serve wasabi and soy here like Akiko's on Bush (a fabulous sushi spot), but unlike Akiko's, Marayu's sushi screamed for it. Perhaps if I had that to mask the lack of flavor of their fish, I would have found it more palatable.I can't remember a time, I silently prayed for the last course to be served so I could go home. I was cold and miserable. The $85 price tag was ridiculous for what we got. So we spent $300+ to be unhappy. The service, BTW was excellent. We won't ever be back, but if we were, we would walk before sitting at a table. I think all the good fish was being served at the bar. And I would never order the canned omakase again but get the real omakase at the bar., After returning from my Minnesota trip, I had a strong craving for fresh fish, namely -- sushi. Our regular sushi chef at our go-to restaurant recently quit, so we're now on the search for a new place. Although Maruya won't be able to fulfill that need (not the kind of place you just drop in on a weekly basis, price-wise, if you know what I mean), we found it while searching for Yelp and decided to give it a try.I called to see if they could seat the BF and I within 10 minutes, and they told me to come by though the sushi bar was already booked for the night. We knew going in that we would order the omakase, but after eating here, I wish we would have waited to make resos at the bar.We opted for Maso's omakase, which came with about 15-20 pieces of nigiri plus some other items. The first dish was laid out beautifully and included an uni chawanmushi, ankimo, and a bowl of gingko nut/chestnutt/plum. The rest is history, though the saba was really the star of the night much to my surprise.Service was on point and during one dish reveal, the waiter accidentally picked up some leaf which somehow fell onto our nigiri, to which he apologized profusely and immediately got us a new dish. That along with our tea cups being refreshed with newly brewed tea cups each time made for an excellent meal.Bill was around $180 + tip. Extremely pricey for just a regular night. I'd come back, try the other omakase menus, and would definitely sit at the sushi bar so I can marvel at the technique up close and personal., 'A friend knew how we were big fans of quality sushi, so she suggested we all try out this new spot that opened. We tried the nigiri omakase, which started out with a steamed tofu dish with a piece of uni on top. WE then followed with some hamachi and kanpachi tataki, and the rest were nigiri pieces until we told them to stop. The sushi was delicious, great quality. However, when the bill came was when the trouble started. They gave us a list of the fish they had served us, and we noticed that they charged us for 7 extra pieces of fish that we never got -- at an average of about 8 dollars a piece, this is significant. When we pointed it out, they removed those pieces, but then added some more pieces elsewhere on the list (perhaps hoping we wouldn notice?!?), and they also added a charge of $30 for the steamed egg appetizer! We got them to remove the extra pieces of fish they added that we didn get, but we were too frustrated to argue the $60 extra dollars for our two appetizers, which should have been part of the omakase.TLDR: Great sushi, but they need to keep better track of what they serve us with the omakase.', Thank you, Chef Masa, for the best meal I had in 2013.The restaurant is beautiful, the wooden counter, decor, the cabinets behind the sushi bar... the whole ambiance is very modern, minimal, and organic.Service was top notch, servers were polite, friendly, and professional.The quality of the fish is what makes this place so special, every piece we had was just exceptional. Sitting at the bar, and watching the chefs work is like the culinary equivalent of watching the NBA final game 7.This is not the place for everyone. If you like rolls with sweet sauce on top, then don't come here. If you are looking for deep fried stuffs, things with cream cheese inside, then don't come here. If you are on a budget, don't come here. Anyone who gives this place less than 5 stars doesn't know how to appreciate great Japanese food., 'Fish is delicious, it needs no soy sauce and melts in mouth. A whole new level. Staff and owner makes the experience cozy authentic (more japan than America) and more than worthwhile. Price for food and drinks was great for what you get. Highly recommended.', 'High quality sushi. A must do for sushi lovers. We ordered the sashimi moriwase and it was enough for two people. We were stuffed when we left.', Considering that this Japanese joint is in SF and not LA (sorry to be biased, but where all the good Asian food is), Maruya does an incredible job. We settled for this restaurant as a plan B since state bird provision was too insane of a wait, but it was a well made decision. We ordered the $85/person omakase which came with traditional dishes along with sashimi, soup, and 8 nigiri pieces. To tell you the truth, when the first few dishes came out, I was somewhat disappointed, but this all changed once the first two nigiris were served. We regret not opting for the nigiri only option, which was half the price!! Well, now we know...and now you know. My favorite part of the omakase meal was of course, the nigiri. The fishes they used were so fresh and just melts in your mouth, like other Japanese restaurants I've eaten at in LA. The salmon was incredible and so was the uni, but seriously, every nigiri we had with the set was heavenly. Like I wanted to get up and jump for joy after each bite. I highly recommend Maruya if you never had good Japanese sushi and love raw fish. Just come and order the nigiri only omakase and I guarantee that you will not regret it!!, Two words: Masa's course. If you are afraid of trying new (some cooked) dishes and only want pure sashmi/sushi then opt for Hide's course. Everything we were served from Masa's omakase was delicious and perfectly presented, especially the cooked dishes. The amount of food was just right as we were definitely satisfied and full. Easily one of the best Japanese spots in the city..., We came to Maruya's and ordered Masa's omakase. It started with a few cooked dishes and then a selection of nigiri. One of the notable dishes was a black cod with ginger sprout. The fish was very soft and the ginger sprout was a nice extra side. The nigiri was very good, a nice selection of fresh fish, but the rice was a bit crumbly. We also decided to order the Matcha Tiramisu but that was a bit disappointing. It was very creamy but very little matcha taste and barely any cake piece.A great place, and I wouldn't mind coming back to order the other omakase option consisting of just sashimi and sushi., 'Incredible, innovative Japanese dining. Its easy to argue that this is the best in SF.Sit down, ask to be taken on a journey, and mention food aversions - because items like monkfish liver & fish collar are likely to appear. Sake list is very good.Thanks to everyone who took care of me!', My new favorite Japanese restaurant in San Francisco. Hubs and I were excited to have discovered this authentic joint serving up some of the best sushi nigiri and sashimi here in the Mission.The entire restaurant gives off the zen feel, so upon walking in, we felt relaxed and comfortable. The interior is designed beautifully and the waitstaff are professional, knowledgable and very courteous. So far, so good.The menu is incredibly simple, and we have tried both. Maruya offers two types of meal: omakase (chef's selection) or moriawase (assorted sushi platter). Omakase is definitely worth it. The selection changes based on what's fresh, and it comes with small plates, sushi nigiri and sashimi, finished off with a hot bowl of miso soup. But if you don't feel like breaking your bank or you just want some fresh fish, the moriawase will do just fine. It's a solid 10-piece nigiri platter that will leave you satisfied. And if that's not enough, you can always order a la carte (but mind you, the pricing is per piece, so it adds up). I highly recommend the toro and the uni if you want to finish off with a few excellent pieces. All in all, we were both extremely impressed. Definitely our favorite spot in San Francisco to get sushi when we can't make it over to Yume., 'The New Year Eve menu - $170 per person for one of the most disappointing meals Ie ever had.The Bad:- They seated us at a table next to the window - cold enough that we had to keep our jackets on. The lighting was also much dimmer than the rest of the restaurant. - The salad is one cherry tomato cut in half, one baby carrot cut in half, and two tiny radishes with an underwhelming cheese dipping sauce.- A small cup of half lukewarm, half cold tofu with a pool of truffle oil at the top. The truffle oil had not infused into the tofu and the overall taste was bland.- A lukewarm poached tomato that had a hospital taste.- I was brought a dish with shrimp even though I mentioned that I allergic to shellfish at the beginning of the meal.- The wait staff brought two plates out without explaining what they were setting down in front of us. I had to ask them as they were leaving.- Service was slow.- Dessert was below average.The Good:- The small portion of black cod with fresh ginger was delicious.- The toro, scottish salmon, and hamachi nigiri were great.Left very disappointed.', Ok this was sooo random for me. I was walking down and was like, man I am kind of wanting a burrito or a taco ... and then as I walked by Pancho Villa, I saw a huge line and was just like eh, I will keep walking. Then I noticed what looked like a half boarded up building, and like a drape over a door. Ok I was like what's this. The door was open and Boom! this was like all polished and fancy sushi joint inside. Ok Sold, checking this place out. Seating for 1 at the bar, if possible. Host was like without a reservation ... uh oh sure.Sat down and the two chefs didn't mess around. I ordered the omakase (from which chef I don't remember, but he was the one standing in front of me so I was like let's do this). It was pretty awesome not gonna lie. Super fresh fish, great great cuts and a really nice staff. Had a bottle of dry sake as well made the whole thing great. The toro super great. Had a bit of octopus suckers too in the end made up with a brine, tasted great. The best though by far was the ankimo. Damn that was some fatty ankimo. Soo soo good. 5 giant pieces just dropped in front of me and I was just like OMG I'm in heaven. Also had some abalone, which was the first for me admittedly. I got to say, not my fave but I think that's just because it wasn't good texture for me. But flavor-wise it was pretty good.Anyways yeah this place is pricey but looking at what it really is, is a lot of atmosphere. So I can imagine what it looked like with me rolling in here with just a stained hoody, while everyone else was dressed for a date or having a business dinner. It pretty styling and easy to walk right by.Overall small place, like 4 - 6 tables sized for two that could be pulled together for the max of 6 people it looked like. The bar appeared to seat around 8-9 it looked like. I would love to come back., Got the Masa's Course and the Moriawase. Was very happy with both. Didn't feel the Masa's was worth the extra coin, but quality was great. Skip dessert, the green tea tiramisu was a great concept but poorly executed. Service was wonderful. Wine and sake were wonderful. Atmosphere was wonderful.The icing on the cake? My date, someone who had never empathized with people who eat for pleasure over function, had her mind blown. She exclaimed how it was the first time she understood eating food for the enjoyment. Hats off to the crew here., Absolutely amazing. I'll start with the service which was incredible and very attentive. As an example, we ordered a bottle of saki that they kept for us in a bucket of ice far from our table. Our glasses were never empty and we never had to ask for refills. And this with every seat taken. Like I said, attentive. The food was amazing. You can do order various nigiri, or do the omakase. That's the right choice. They check to make sure there is nothing you dislike, but then you are at the whims of the artists behind the sushi bar. Unlike pretty much every place in SF, they don't serve wasabi and soy sauce with the nigiri. It's just you and the fish. Of course the fish was up to the task. Toro that melted in my mouth. This is a great place for a special night. Wewill be back., Wow did I miss something? I guarantee Maruya is dropping from 4.5 stars very soon if they keep up with the quality they delivered when I visited. I tried both the omakase and the sushi moriawase and was unimpressed by the food and the price.Sushi quality was variable, the toro was the biggest hit. It literally melted in my mouth. I enjoyed some of the cooked side dishes, like the pickled greens. Everything else was mostly mediocre, including basic cuts of tuna which tasted extremely fishy and chewy. I have had a better order of tuna at Benihana! The rice wasn't cooked through and poorly seasoned; it was so bad that I scraped it off the nigiri because it was ruining the flavor. The wasabi was jolting in a bad way.I think one of the low points of the meal was when I saw the empanada place closing up shop across the street, and wondered where 4th meal was going to be at. Maruya, step up your game!, Maruya was really, really, good. Best sushi I've had? Nope, for the price point I've definitely had better, but that's partially because I've been spoiled by sushi in NYC. It was about $150pp with the omakase (although this might have been due to it being a holiday night), and sake. It was definitely a great experience, and the owner was pretty enthusiastic about the entire operation (and the popularity of the place so far), and was doing a solid job of checking on everyone and joking around in a semi-dry manner. The decor's lovely in an elegant, plain way, definitely nothing too flashy to distract from the food. And onto the actual food - we came here on NYE and it was special pricing for the menu, ended up getting the omakase rather than the holiday set menu, and chef Hide was the one to prep it all. (If you want to buy a drink for the chefs here as a thank-you, Hide likes beer, btw!) He definitely knows what he's doing, and seasons and cuts the fish with a deft hand. Each time he placed the sushi on the leaf before us, he'd explain what the piece was, sometimes what he'd do to it (as in why he was searing the otoro and not just leaving it raw, or kinda why he was prepping stuff) and although he wasn't super talkative, was still fairly friendly. We also saw a couple splitting an omakase or the pieces they ordered? Somehow? They were sitting next to us, Hide-san was cutting the pieces in half and placing it in front of them. First time for everything.Uni was great as always, and I think I enjoyed almost everything I had (which I don't exactly remember nowadays, but salmon, red snapper, toro, otoro, mackarel, and a couple others were on that list) and was pretty full afterwards. The flavors were quiet, not overdone (think not heaps of oversauced, in your face stuff) but overall definitely fresh and just shy of the border of amazing (so I guess just really good). I didn't like the tofu that much, I found it a little bland and would have preferred they seasoned it a little better or put something on the bottom to eat with, but the texture was good. We got sake with it and were trying to decide between a couple options, and they just let us try sake cups of each, which was a really nice gesture - and in the end, their recommendation was definitely the best :) I liked the green tea tiramisu even if it needs a little tweaking, the other dessert we got was ehhh. Do I think its worth the money? Probably on a non-holiday night, but even then, if its for a special occasion, definitely spring for it. It's a good experience, but it might not be the best that you've ever had, but definitely what you would probably expect for the price point. If you like sushi, go! It'll definitely be worth it for you, (p.s it seems like sitting at the bar may net you a better experience), but if you're not a fan of traditionalist sushi, it might not be the place for you., Beautiful interior. Very traditional. Great service. Great ambiance. Food: We had the omakase. It wasn't as strong of a showing as I'd hoped. The presentation was great, but some of the flavors were lacking.The good:- Uni. I LOVE UNI. MORE UNI PLEASE. It was great quality and fresh- the starting dishes were inventive and the nigiri courses were pretty generousThe bad:- some of the fish wasn't spectacular. And for the price I was expecting fresh, melty goodness. Some were a little rough and not as fresh as I'd like.I'd say for the price/volume/quality/ambiance this is pretty good. However this is not the best quality fish I've ever had., 'Have been waiting with baited breath for Chef Masa to open up ever since Sebo shut down and we heard he was striking out on his own. Have been a couple times since they opened, and Maruya did not disappoint!The space is beautiful and the food is excellent. Well on its way to taking the title of best sushi experience in town!', Amazing food, service and setting. After moving to SF from New York, where I had been spoiled with the likes of Yasuda and Azabu, I found it tough to find a sushi joint that consistently served amazing sushi. You know, 100% traditional, fresh fish, great knifework, perfect rice, delicious seaweed, etc. For a long time, Okoze was the primary contender, but Maruya has really bested all competition in SF. We had the Sushi Moriawase set - $40 for 10 pieces of nigiri - all delicious, even the different types of mackerel, which restaurants often can't get right. The set comes with red miso soup (excellent), small hijiki amuse, and kobachi. We then ordered housemade tofu with uni, ikura, tamago and matcha tiramisu, which were all excellent. Tea was refilled every few minutes and service was prompt and friendly. That combined with the dimly lit bamboo walls created an extremely calming atmosphere. Can't wait to go back!, I like!We were invited to join some friends whom swore by this place. The place is beautifully decorated. The sushi bar is the best seat in the house! We ordered the Omakase Masa's course for $85 and paired that with some Sake. At the beginning of service, the chef asks if you have any preferences or what you can or can not eat. Each dish is beautifully constructed and sometimes, is too pretty to eat! Each dish is also spaced out, which I love, and is delivered at a smooth pace. By the end of the meal, I was so stuffed. Expensive? Yes, but the quality of fish fits the price tag. The dining experience is also worth checking out. I felt as if I was dining at an establishment in Japan! Service was great. The chefs are super nice and will often times chat with you. Tip: Make a reservation and sit at the bar! Also, when you receive the nigiri course, you will be eating with your hands/fingers (for any germaphobes out there)., 'maru means circle so look for the big circle - sushi not served for those looking for a sign that spells out maruya. definitely japanesey - the wood of the sushi bar, everyone who works there, the ceramic cups, bowls, etc. fish selection is not as exotic as i would like, but the rice (flavor, size, shape) was incredible. I sit in front of Hide to get blown away.', What a bummer... I was not impressed with this place at all. Don't come here if you're looking for a regular sushi spot. This is definitely a very traditional Japanese restaurant - there's nothing wrong with it, but just not what I expecting. The menu includes: Omakase Masa's course 85Santen mori, zensai, sashimi, yakimono, 8-piece nigiri, owanHide's course AQSashimi, sushiMoriawase Sushi moriawase 4010-piece nigiri, 1 hand roll, kobachi, owanSashimi moriawase 455-piece sashimiI ordered the moriawase sushi, and although the presentation was beautiful, it simply wasn't that impressive of a meal. Also, almost everything is in Japanese, which is of little-to-no-help for this white girl.The decor and the actual space is beautiful and really nice.... But I wasn't really impressed with the food. It's extremely expensive for what you get, and not many options unless you go a la cart with sushi. Even so, I felt like these were very expensive for what you get. Don't think I'll be coming back!, 'Great quality sushi and charming service.', 'Very slow, high quality, delicious experience. The waiter was helpful in helping us select a few unique items from their menu and everything tasted wonderful. This is definitely not your normal Americanized sushi experience. It is a bit on the pricier side for my taste, so its a special occasion restaurant. I do look forward to going back soon though.', I've been wanting to come here and try the Omakase and Moriawase Sushi for the experience and Maruya didn't let us down!We enjoyed every appetizer and fresh piece of fish that was delivered to us in a perfectly timed manner. We weren't waiting for the next dish and weren't rushed either. Everything tasted amazing and the service was impeccable. This is definitely a higher end restaurant-both the food and service reflect that. So while we can't come here on a weekly basis, we will definitely be back sooner than later to enjoy the experience and food!, 'Great service and best sushi ever! We asked for shiny fish and the sushi chef literally pulled out a box of shiny fish, very fresh and delicious.The area is not so great and there is no sign on the wall but you know where you are once you go inside. Very modern and minimalist decor. Can wait to go back for excellent sushi!', I think this is the best dining experience I have ever had.Maruya is very inconspicuous. there is no sign outside but inside you are transporting into a different world.We had the Omakase instead of the Valentines day special. We wanted more nigiri than warm food so that is why we made that choice.This is what I can remember.Lobster and flower in miso jelly- the texture was different but in a good way and I thought this was pretty good. Never had I had such a thing.Tofu with truffle- Omg this tasted like Chawanmushi! The tofu was so silky and the truffles were delicious.Raw Oysters- It was salty and I love the acid from the lemon.Burrata and tomato- This may sound weird but the burrata had the bounciness and a softness like a baby's ass. The burrata was creamy but the tomato was a bit hard to cut but its okay.Lobster- this was really rich and topped off with cheese. Love love loved this lobsterNigiri -All of them were outstanding! My personal favorite were the mackeral, uni, and medium fatty tuna. I'm sure if you go to Maruya you will have a different selection of nigiri than I do so it probably doesnt matter if I describe each fish. All the nigiri come with the perfect amount of soy sauce and wasabi!Matcha Tiramisu - THE BEST DESSERT OF MY LIFE. It was soft. It was luscious. The matcha was perfect. If I could have it everyday for the rest of my life, I would.Red Bean with Raspberry - this was really good too. I dont like red bean but this definitely made me change my mind.There's plenty of parking around Maruya and its a bit pricey but definitely worth it. I am drooling just thinking about it. YUM, 10/21/14 UPDATE - MASA & HIDE ARE GONE! And from what I know, it was shady happenings.. insidescoopsf.sfgate.com43_ I guess I'll have to give Shinichi Kawaguchi a shot, but we shall see. I don't know, I was very fond of Masa._________________________________________________________This is not the place to get your dragon tempura roll w/ extra ponzu sauce on the side. This is not the place to dine and dash and it is most certainly not for you if you are a cheap a$$. This is for the sushi snobs, the purists, those willing to shell out some bucks for the good stuff. Maruya is an experience in itself. Make a reservation (ask for the bar) and allow yourself a couple of hours.Quite possibly one of the best meals I had in 2013 (birthday meal to boot) and I enjoyed every last minute of it up until I was so full I was getting groggy sitting at the sushi bar. Went with Masa's omakase and it was everything I had thought it would be. There was soup, a couple of cooked dishes, some sashimi and tonssss of nigiri. A lot of the fish was flown in from Japan and I had never tried them before. Masa will keep feeding you until you cannot eat anymore. Although I was starting to get full about 3/4 of the way through our meal, I tried to hang on and devour it all. Food coma followed, believe me. Watching Masa work was beautiful. He can appear standoffish and stoic, but deep down inside is a man happy to make sushi for those willing to try everything. When we were done with our meal, he opened up and talked to me for a bit. So much about him reminded me of my favorite beloved sushi chef who passed away last year (RIP Toshi Sasaki). It's truly obvious that Masa (short for Masaki Sasaki) pays a great amount of attention to detail. His knives, the chopsticks, the cutting boards - they're all specially engraved for him. The interior of this place is gorgeous. The dark wood is finished very well. If you want high quality fish, gorgeous ambiance and a beautiful show, then make it a night for Maruya., So for #1400, the plan was to unveil it sooner. But I needed a fresher perspective for all the visits under my belt, so held off doing so. And for mysterious unexplained reasons, I didn't get my 2014 badge this year. Guess I no longer make the cut. But thanks, it was awesome while it lasted! Thus I contemplated just quitting reviewing altogether, and just do FOBenese tips & checkins. But I would just be setting a bad example for others and allowing lots of various online characters to run amok, while disappointing those who truly appreciate, understand, and enjoy being amused by the shite I write on this site. Let me also say that it takes a very trained and disciplined mindset to truly understand and appreciate high end sushi. You must be open minded, cast away what you think you know, what you have been used to eating locally. It also helps to go beyond available Western media which at times is too narrow viewed and slanted, made to mystify and objectify till it becomes dbag BS. e.g. you don't see a Japanese director putting out an indie artsy film about the struggles of Ty Flo or Josh Skenes; they do movies about nigiri sushi coming to life with sharp sharky teeth, killing humans while drawing blood (and lots of it) while a sexy female ninja heroine comes and kills the flesh eating nigiri with a katana. And her name is not Jiro.If you seek to understand Maruya from the big picture, as well as the chefs and owners, & what they went through to get here, this is essentially an ultimate dream come true for them. And that is, to work in the best environment, have access to some of the best materials, and put their true training, skills to the maximum test to deliver the best possible experience within the realms of reality, in hopes of changing the state of sushi in SF Bay Area and bringing up the quality bar.With all that said, yes, Maruya is as close to a proper a high end hybrid kappo/sushi upscale place in Taipei, HK, or Japan, just a few notches below Ginza style high end sushi...(but seriously it's already damn good for SF, be proud!).Here are a few pointers and comments to those going in- It's ok if you are hungry, but please be patient and understanding. Wait your turn before your chef gives you his attention after serving other patrons at the bar and tables. You will enjoy your meal a lot more that way.- Don't yap away loudly and interrupt the peace and vibe of the place. We do not care to hear about your well traveled sushi experiences just because you ate at 15 East, Brushstroke, Yasuda, or that you lived in Japan and want to practice your Japanese with the chef and A$N date like a 3some. Do not try to show off your DSLR camera and superficial sushi knowledge which you learn from the printed menu in hopes to pickup nearby female customers.- Do not put your hands together & bow like you are in a Thai temple when you thank the chefs on your way out. Makes you look like a serious insensitive non PC Dbag. - Keep an open mind with trying what they have to offer. Appreciate a range of textures, flavors and feast on the seasons with your senses.- Appreciate the preparation, staging, process, and every aspect of what the chef does to get a piece of nigiri to you, a lot of work and passion and effort when into it. And it is an extreme pleasure to watch. - The rice is very delicately seasoned with aka-su (red vinegar) giving it a darker shade than what you are used to. It is not brown rice, and not soy sauce! Appreciate the balance of the fish to properly seasoned sushi rice, and how the two interact with another. This is one of the greats of high end sushi. Educate and train yourself on this before you make erroneous statements.- The service here is exemplary by Japanese standards- Fall to winter are sexcellent seasons to eat fish, which have higher than normal fat and oil content.

However, it took a lot of vegetable foreplay to get there.', Incredible sushi. I took my boyfriend here the other night for his birthday - he's a huge sushi fanatic, I have never been a huge fan of raw fish. But I figured if there's ever a time to get into sushi, it would be now. He did the Omakase - very expensive, but great choice. We sat at the bar, which I would HIGHLY recommend. You can watch the chefs cut the fish, prepare the sushi, even grind wasabi. The chef was mostly preparing for the two of us and a man sitting next to us, so we felt we got a lot of attention! He'd ask what we'd like, prepare the sushi, then place them in front of us. This level of preparation is like watching a master painter at work - a high level of art. The service was excellent - I told them it was his birthday, the hostess asked while I made the reservation for the correct spelling of his name, and they brought out a tiramisu/green tea-esque dessert which was so delicious!Very expensive, but worth it for a special occasion., Maruya is an experience within itself and can't be comparable to any other fancy restaurant. My bf and I spent a belated valentine's day dinner here a few nights ago because we've been on a sashimi binge for the past few weeks and wanted a taste of high-quality fish and an authentic Japanese restaurant. And be ready to shell out some Benjamin's because it ain't cheap! Restaurant seats between 20-25 people allowing intimate conversations with each other and if youre lucky to sit at the bar, theres no barrier between you and the sushi chefs. Before ordering, the waiter will ask you what fish you dont like or any allergies you may have. We started off with a 4pc toro sashimi (for $36). VERY oily and ..well FATTY to nearly feeling slimy. My lips were so moisturized after that LOL. The 15 PC sashimi was on point. Salmon and chu-toro were my favorite, melting in my mouth with every bite. The bass, mackeral, and hamachi were delicious as well. To top it off, we were given miso soup with steamed clams and I ordered green tea tiramisu. Yummy!My advice is to not go in on an empty stomach as it may not fill you up. Keep an open mind about trying different fish. There was fish ive never seen before and looked in aesthetically pleasing but you'll surprised by how they taste. I'm officially sashimi'd out., 'One sentence review--finally an A grade sushi experience in the Bay Area!Slightly longer review--Maruya is a godsend for SF, which until now, did not have a sushi restaurant that I could recommend confidently to foodies from Japan.In terms of the quality of the ingredients, there very little to complain about. They buy solid quality fish and know how to prepare it correctly. One way of knowing whether a sushi-chef knows his stuff is to try the kohada. I won go into the details of why, but basically it takes a lot of time and skill to make good kohada consistently (kohada is 80% skill, 20% product, whereas other fish such as tuna are 80% product, 20% skill), so if a sushi restaurant has good kohada, youe in good shape for the night. If their kohada isn shiny and silvery, with the flesh still pink, having the right balance of salt, acid, and a hint of the ocean flavor (not too much), you may want to rethink the rest of the omakase course. Maruya kohada was very good, so you know they care about their product.Their same care goes into all of the other pieces. In particular, I loved the way Hide-san carefully blanched pieces of octopus suction cups in hot water to get just the right texture before serving them.In terms of their rice, that is one area where I feel they could use a tiny bit of improvement--I prefer rice that is a bit firmer, where you can taste each grain. My other preference is for akasu (red vinegar) over white vinegar, but that is purely preference. Their rice is still better than anything else you can find in the Bay Area.You do pay for the quality of the meal, however. It not a cheap night out, especially if you go past the normal omakase course and start adding extras, which is hard not to do. So prepare your wallet and your stomach--youe in for a good night out.If Maruya was in Tokyo, I say that they were four stars--really good, but missing the extra oomph from the rice to push them into magical territory you get from the top top places. They are, however, as good as it gets in the Bay Area, so they get full marks from me.', Awesome traditional sushi. Had the nigiri plate. A bit expensive compared to other sushi joints you might go to, but absolutely worth it.Can't wait to go back!, Expensive, but this is the closest SF-equivalent to a Jiro-type experience you'll find. The seasoned sushi chefs have many awards and you can see instantly that everything is prepared with skill. The menu exudes precision and wisdom. Try to get a seat at the bar so you'll get a great view of the chefs in action!, Best sushi in town!!! If you think Akiko's if the best, you need come try Maruya!!!!!, Everyone, please stop reviewing this place. I don't want anyone to find out about the best sushi spot in SF., I've been to Maruya twice: once for the omakase and another time for a la carte at the bar. During the omakase, I didn't really care for a lot of the appetizers. I can't really recall what we had because it just wasn't that memorable. There was a broiled salmon course that was slightly on the overcooked side, but the skin was delightfully crispy. Things didn't really pick up until the nigiri came. Extremely delicious chutoro and uni. The chutoro was slightly torched on the outside which helped render the fat and gave it that melt in your mouth sensation. I'm not sure which uni they used in the omakase, but it was really fresh and clean tasting. Without any icky fishy flavors, the richness was really emphasized and made me want to eat more of it. I added an order of ankimo, and it was probably one of the best I've had. Its texture was really smooth and silky, and there was no fishiness to get in the way of its delicate flavor. The rice was also notable. The texture was slightly firm so I could make out each individual grain. I'm not sure what it's seasoned with, but it tasted less acidic than most sushi places, and I liked how it paired with the various fishes and shellfish. At the end, I had the gluten free version of the clam soup, which was pretty awesome. There was a lot of clam and umami flavor in the broth, and it had a roasted kombu flavor that gave it a gentle, almost smoky hint. It was a pretty godlike soup. I think I enjoyed my experience at the bar more than the omakase. I was able to get all the good parts of the omakase while adding other stuff I wanted. I haven't seen gindara (black cod/sablefish) on many sushi menus around here so I wanted to try that. If you've only had misoyaki black cod, this is really worth the try. The texture is a little firmer, and there's a delicate sweetness that disappears when black cod is cooked. The only cooking method that preserves this raw flavor is steaming, which is my favorite way of eating black cod. The live botanebi was a fun thing to order. You can see the shrimp squirm around as it's being prepared. The shrimp was really sweet and succulent, but they put on a little too much lemon juice for my tastes. The fried heads that came afterwards were also really well made. The crispy legs and shell with the rich goopy stuff inside had a very nice contrast. I got the same clam soup again, and it was just as good as before. My friend thought mine was better than her regular version of the soup. I think I could have an entire meal of just that clam soup, and I'd be pretty happy.Overall, Maruya is a pretty great sushi place. Grab a seat at the bar, and just enjoy., OK, here it goes. It seems they are trying to be very exclusive and unique, but really, in my opinion, over the top; I don't need my saki served to me, I certainly don't need my soy sauce served to me, they don't leave the soy sauce on the table, we kept having to ask for more soy sauce since the pour was the size of a pea, come on people, don't be stingy with the frieken soy sauce.... I wish someone had mentioned this in the reviews so I hope this helps the next person: This restaurant serves no rice, no salad, no rolls, no oshinko, no low sodium soy sauce, no appetizers. Literally, its just sashimi and nigiri, good fish but not out of this world. $300 later for 2 people and we left the place still hungry, had to grab fast food, um no thank you...Oh and the very salty miso soup comes at the end of the meal...I asked very nicely if we could have it before the meal and the server said no, lol., The best sushi restaurant I've been to in the Bay Area. Wayyyyy better than Ichi in my opinion - it's at another level. The decor is neat and modern, and I love how the sushi chefs and bar are so close to everyone. We got the Maruya Omakase. The quality of the fish was excellent - I liked everything, especially the spanish mackerel which had an interesting sticky finish. The dessert with chocolate mochi and matcha latte was also amazing and original. The service was also great - when our green tea was getting low, we'd automatically get new cups delivered to our table without us asking - this happened around four times. I think it's good value for the quality and service you get.|1

Perfection beyond perfection. Masa was the best dining experience i have ever had. it's a good thing it is in NYC, because if it were in SF, i just might be selling myself to go here every night...perhaps like the escorts sitting next to us at the sushi bar with their heinously drunk businessman clients. that really added flavor. it definately helped to alleviate the natural nervousness and reserve we both felt, as we always do when in such an awe inspiring and sophisticated place...but all that not being relevent, i will just say that i literally shed a few small tears several times during this meal, so overwhelmed was i with everything. Ahhhh, sushi., I contemplated reviewing Masa's because well... I'm Japanese. I've lived in Tokyo where frankly the sushi-go-rounds beat some of the top rated sushi restaurants here. Only one of my memorable dinners exceeded a grand. (for three people) It's too bad that hefty price tags are a given for real good food in the U.S. and lately it seems too inflated.That said, my experience had to be one of the best I've had. Easily places in my top 20. However, it's too damn expensive! I also took a peek at Bar Masa's menu. 50 dollars for negi-toro is too over the top. Bottom line, if you can afford it, go to Masa's, not the Bar, for the full experience. But if you can't, save your money. Two trips to Masa's will cover flight and accommodations for a week in Tokyo. Easily. *travel budget calculated during off peak seasons and staying at a weekly apartment instead of a regular hotel. peak season would be three trips to Masa.editI docked a star because Masa doesn't tip out their staff - servers included - FOR SHAME., 'i LOVE this place!! i am still glowing from the experience here. sigh... im lost for words to say about this place. how about i just list what we ate: 1. hairy crab + octopus seaweed salad 2. toro + caviar with toast 3. kochi marinated in ponzu and lavender 4. baby eels in sizzling white sesame oil 5. uni risotto with white truffle shavings 6. hamo (pike eel) shabu shabu in matsutake mushroom broth, with cucumber vinaigrette 7. now comes the sushi: toro, shima aji, hirame, tai, suzuki, ika w yuzu, taragai, kuruma shrimp, koba shira (baby scallop), hotate w yuzu, tako, kohada, aji, seared toro, sanma (pike fish), matsutake mushroom sushi, japanese uni (really good!!), anago, unagi in cucumber wrap, and white truffle rice balls (!!!!!) 8. a massive toro maki with green onions 9. ume rice ball with shiso leaf 10. finally, a japanese grapefruit sorbet and udon tea. everything was expertly presented, and of extremely high quality and freshness. this was the cleanest, nicest looking sushi bar i have ever seen in my life. totally worth the $350 per person, plus 2 carafes of $85 dai gingo sake, plus tax and 20% tip. seriously!! i wish i could eat here every day...', I've eaten Sushi in Tokyo including a place right in Tsukiji (sushi dai). That's probably the best place i've eaten. The fish was just to fresh and the price was right... I've eaten at many of the high and low end sushi places in NYC from Nobu to sushi joints in the East Village. I've also eaten at Masa's old place in Beverly Hills (2 Rodeo Drive). Both my meal at Ginza Sushi-Ko (more than 10 years ago) and my meal at Masa, just after they opened are more memorable than any other meals i've eaten. Tiny baby squid, Lobster Sabu Sabu, Turo Rolls, just to name a few... Instead of going to Atlantic City and dropping $500 or $700 go here.., 'This IS perfection.......from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave. My fellow yelpers reviews have it nailed.', I don't know if I can stress how tasy this place is!It will cost you an arm and a leg but my god, please try it once in your life! You will not be disappointed!, 'Masa is Excellent but to appreciate the food you most definitely must order the tasting menu. If you decide to order off the regular menu (ala carte) you will be missing the unique experience. I have been fortunate to have had twelve dinners here and every dinner has been very good. The experience is as close to the best in Japan as you will get in the USA. Japan has much better variety and the quality is hard to much with Japan as the abolute best is kept in Japan. In America we are not willing to pay the high prices they get in Japan and Japanese expect the best and are willing to pay for it. The best restaurants in Japan are even more expensive than Masa. Masa is great place for a date, business dinner, or a group much be even better to try more items on the menu. The sake and wine list is extensive and expensive. Being in the Time-Warner complex makes it a great location.', Dinner at Masa to me, is the perfect experience. The atmosphere is relaxed and tranquil. I don't care how people say Per Se or Jean George makes you feel welcome etc.... There is still that feeling of intimidation and grandeur that I'm sure makes almost everyone feel a little out of their league. Masa is completely different. I felt they were humble, everyone just happy to be there. Anyway, If I could, I would eat here almost everyday and I would not say that about any other restaurants in its class. By the end of the meal, I felt great, perfectly content. I was not overly stuffed and left the meal thinking about what I ate and how much I enjoyed it. I even dreamed about it that night and tried to figure out what I would have to do (suck up to parents, save, steal) to go back. The whole meal just flowed together so well and each bite of food was great with interspersed revelations of wow (The others have detailed the menu quite nicely so I won't get into it). Definitely sit at the bar for you first time. There's nothing like watching Masa at work and smelling white truffle and yuzu in anticipation for that piece of sushi. Now, I'm not going to justify the price. If you're willing to pay 500+ for the best, the more power to you. I feel most people (myself included) are happy with excellent sushi and 1/4 the cost. So just ask yourself, how much is the best worth to you? If it's above Masa's price point, enjoy :), 'It is restaurant without equal anywhere in this world and worth every dime.', The most expensive and well-worth it sushi restaurant I've ever been to. It ruined me for sushi for months because of it's high quality. It's a complete experience when letting them decide for you. The staff was friendly and respectfully leave you alone to enjoy the best meal of your life., 'With the omakase, I had about 17 pieces of sushi and 5 cooked dishes. Each piece of sushi is served one at a time and you are told when and when not to use soy sauce. For the money, you get lots of otoro and truffle. I was waiting for the fugu but that never came out.Notes: You definitely want to sit at the sushi bar, front and center. Masa is a master at his craft and slices sushi to perfection. Fresh wasabi. BTW we were able to sneak in a picture of Masa himself slicing up toro before being stopped..and no, I am not sharing it with you...suckers!', Experience the SushiThis is a hard one to review. When we dine at this caliber of restaurant our hurdle rates and expectations are extremely high. The food definitely lived up to those expectations. First is food, then service, then ambiance, then extra points for the little touches.Food unbelievable. Started out with 7 appetizers. The highlight was Ohmi tataki. This was a lightly seared Wagyu Beef. If you have had KOBE before this makes it look like shoe leather. This literally melted in our mouths. Each tender morsel was better then the next. I dont want to call it a mouth orgasm but it was. The $100 supplement per 2oz serving was worth EVERY penny. Japanese sushi I think of Toro and you get lots of it in different ways. My favorite was a Toro Tartare topped with caviar and served with toast points. Masa also provides non typical Japanese ingredients like lots of black truffles. The dish that won me over in this category was an Uni Risotto with black truffle. Typically I am not a fan of Uni (Sea Urchin) because of its strong taste. This dish was a perfectly prepared risotto. The marriage of sea and earth work with the Uni and Black Truffle.Kudos also to the Cherry Blossom Trout shabu shabu.Each piece of sushi (20 of them total) showed that the quality of fish really makes a difference. Before we ate at Masa this was my biggest reservation. How good can sushi be for this price? Masa proved me wrong.The only food disappointment was dessert. It was Japanese strawberries and that was it. I was hoping to be proved wrong that there are not good desserts in asian cuisine. But wasn'tService was good but my only issue was with a place like this I expect each dish to be explained and given some back ground. Our servers are very knowledgeable but the barely spoke english and were very soft spoken. We also like the little things that make the experience. Here it was the serving dishes we rustic and unique. The tables were beautiful unstained wood that they sand down to keep clean. There is a shallow pool behind the sushi bar. We sat at a table but would recommend if you are lucky enough to sit at the bar.Be prepared to spend what a small studio goes for on a dinner for 2. This include sake and 20% Tip is added to bill., 'Have to say in my top 5 restaurants. A dinning experience not just eating,', Let me start by saying that this is the most expensive restaurant that I have ever been to. When I say expensive, I mean EXPENSIVE!!!!. A couple of my friends were in town to celebrate a milestone and they wanted someplace that was as special as the occasion called for. Masa was it!Masa is a rare place where simplicity is celebrated through its food.The minimalistic surroundings are alluring. The design....exquisite. All of which was intended to celebrate the cuisine. When you are starting the meal the server asks you to turn off any cell phones and electronic devices. Finally, a meal that will not be interrupted by movie theme song ringtones! Next, a bowl of lemon water was placed in front of us to use as finger bowls. The most interesting aspect of Masa is that there isn't a standard menu. The menu of the night would be made up of what was available at the market. Tonight, we had a meal full of some of the best sushi outside of the Tsukiji Fish Market. It was a night of Anago, Ika,Toro, Chutoro, Otoro, Torigai, Maguro, Tako, Mirugai, Hokkigai,and Kohada. The flesh of the fish was magnificent. Second to none!The maguro was so intense that everyone at the table seem to be flushed after eating it!!if you get the chance to experience this impeccable restaurant i would suggest that reserve a spot at the bar. You will enjoy everything that Masa has to offer!(The bill at the end of the night was $375 per person * feeling very faint*...Thank God that the bill was picked up by my friends.....They are my best friends!), I went to Masa about 2 years ago and the experience I had was good but not great. If I were to summarize the night I had at Masa it would go like this...quiet place, beautiful decor, excellent service, lots of otoro, about $200/person overpriced. I went with my ex-girlfriend and the meal cost me about a grand including a bottle of sake. I thought the best part was the sushi but to be honest, I liked the sushi much more at Yasuda (even holding cost constant). I think it's a place worth visiting maybe once in your life but for the cost and quality of sushi I recommend going to Yasuda, Sugiyama, Kurumazushi, Blue Ribbon (in that order)., BEFORE REDING THIS REVIEW: please understand that my reviews are a comparative analysis of the establishment versus it's peers. A 5 star rating at Masa and a 5 star rating for a korean restaurant in flushing does not indicate that i consider them equals. One of the best meals i've ever had. We sat at the center of the bar in front of chef masa who cut all our fish himself. FYI If you don't love sushi and can't tell the difference between your local sushi restaurant and say yasuda then perhaps this is not the place for you. Sake list had some great bottles of course but not the longest i've ever seen by any stretch if thats of any concern.The fish was divine and varied from the common to the unheard of. The other dishes were true to his form, simple but heavenly (eg flame seared beef from a province near kobe which i unfortunately forgot the name of). For dessert we were served strawberries. Now normally i would expect a little more but these strawberries were, for lack of a better word, perfect. I suppose in the context of the meal we just had which could only be described as perfect, it was a fitting. In terms of quantity, surprisingly we were well fed and by the time dessert rolled around we were all pretty full.Oh and expect to pay a lot more than the $425 pre fixe + gratuity per head unless you plan on sneaking in your own booze and drinking tap water from the bathroom sink. Our tab hit $525 per head sans the sake, tax and tip. You don't want to know what the final tally was. I would highly recommend Masa to anyone who truly loves sushi. It significantly differentiates itself from Gari, Kuruma Zushi, Yasuda, 15East, Ushiwakamaru and everyone else in NYC., 'Went back and it was just as good!! The tea infusions drove away my little cold and I forgot just how wonderful good, fresh kampachi is.', 'You must sit at the sushi bar if you come here. The lucky customers who know chef Masa get to sit in the middle section and be served directly by him. The newbies get seated on the ends and are served by either of his excellent sous-chefs. 10 seats at the bar if I remember correctly.There are other tables off in a side room, but I feel you miss out on the full experience if you are not sitting at the bar. Meals consists of 5-6 appetizers (I had almost exactly what Amanda B. describes). That was 5 months ago, so menu must not change that much. The toro tartare - caviar with brioche was fantasticFor an additional $100 they offered an extra appetizer dish of japanese wagyu served tataki style (can remember the prefecture they told me it was from). This was excellent.This is followed by a 20 or so course of sushi...usually one piece each but occasionally two (for me toro and uni were two pieces each).Items I remember:blue fin torokampachiajishima ajisquidgiant clamneedle fishflukesnappereel (served inside a cucumber skin--exquisite)toro skin - cooked (wasn skin per se, but another layer of toro meat that chef Masa was slicing earlier in the evening)rice ball coated in summer truffleskohadaunituna rolland a few others... dessert consisted of two types of tea and sliced japanese pear.Our tab was $1550 for two (including the kakunko sake and one other daiginjo carafe)Enjoy!!', This place is amazing as I have only been there once b/c it is so expensive. It is more of an experience than anything else. It's unlike anything in the world. I've only been to Spain, Paris, and London. So my observations are limited but rest assure this place is profound like none other. It's in a neat location and there's lots to do close by afterwards. If you have a grand to drop, stop by after a 6 month wait period for a reservation and enjoy the ride., Do you have $1000 dollars to blow on dinner? Can you spare 3 hours for dinner? Make a rez at Masa. Masa is the only dining experience that comes even close to justifying the cost.The restaurant specializes in traditional Japanese Kaiseki-style dinner. Chef Masa was personally recruited from his famous Beverly Hills restaurant Ginza Sushiko by Thomas Keller. The dinner will cost $400-$500 a head without alcohol, tax, and tip! I didn't realize how poor I was until I ate here! =)He sands down his counter every day. His knives are practically samurai swords. He imports fish directly flown from Japan to his restaurant. He also specializes in Fugu, the poisonous Pufferfish. Dinner at Masa is very special. In fact, it is more like a performance. You have reserved front row seats. You are essentially leasing the services of a Japanese master chef for an entire evening. A $500-$800 price tag, in this context, starts to seem reasonable.His offerings change depending on the quality and the season. Here's one example of what you can expect:He will scrape beautifully marbeled Toro off a pristine Tuna loin with the a clam shell. He then serves this with toasted points and Beluga caviar. He will toast the points to order. As soon as you are almost finished with your first piece, he will begin toasting another point. The entire meal progresses in this fashion. You will have the highest grade imported Wagyu beef, a comprehensive flight of sushi, and several other amazing courses. The real attraction is the Fugu which numbs your mouth. The sole purpose of his entire existence for that evening is to treat you like the emperor of Japan.So I recommend you swap your front row concert ticket or Knicks' floor seat for one evening at Masa. After he retires, you may never get the opportunity again. Masa is on My Fave 10 NYC as The Best Once-in-a-Lifetime Dining Experience., 'Easily the best meal of my life.', 'a good friend married well and i got to go to masa for free. we sat at the sushi bar where we had our own chef, though not the man himself. he was there overseeing our guy who definitely knew what he was doing. a couple of the dishes before the sushi began were exact copies of things i had when i went to japan, like delicate eel served in broth in a teapot. the toro and caviar starter was buttery and decadent. we had noodles made from fish- inventive and an adventure in texture. then the sushi began. it was absolutely the best i have ever had. i play the lottery in the hopes that i win and have the money to return here again and again.', 'The best most memorable sushi experience I have ever had so far. o-toro sashimi this o-toro handroll.. everything was o-toro. The meal was from about two years ago but first time I have experienced the mysterious Fugu. Masa served us a study of Fugu done 3 different ways. Fugu Shabushabu, Fugu drum stick, and Fugu Sashimi.', 'Best Japanese restaurant/sushi in the city! Masa just received 3 Michelin stars (difficult since they favor french restaurants) and they deserve every one. All of the food is incredibly fresh and delectable. The sushi literally melts in your mouth and be sure to try the oysters! Now as far as price, yes it is very expensive but worth every penny IF youe not into the stuffy, snooty NY crowd that pricy restaurants tend to attract. Anyone that goes to Masa should go purely for the food and not to be seen, as it is a very laid back, serene setting and no one is going to kiss your a**. :)', I hope I can afford it every week! :P This man is too serious about food. His sushi is goddamngood!!! Even I wasn't so happy I had been pushed to use my hand to eat the sushi one time we sat at the bar, their sushi is just too good to find anywhere else in new york... So I am being cheap... I am still going once a while :P For the about 10 small appetizers, some were really good, some were just good, but this guy's sushi is always perfect..., I'll probably get flamed for a 2 star rating, but I have to say it's 100% not worth the hype, and it's entirely too overpriced in every respect.Our total - with tip and alcohol included - was in the mid 4 figures. With that kind of price tag, I definitely expected a lot more. The food was good, but nothing really blew my mind. I know it's all about the experience and eating food created by the legendary Chef Masa, but I was honestly disappointed.The staff was sort of cold and unfriendly. Our waiter knew his stuff, but his demeanor was really off-putting. I wasn't looking for a Friday's style waiter at a restaurant of this caliber, but he made me feel pretty uncomfortable.I - and my three guests - ended up leaving still hungry. All of this said, the quality of the food was fine. The toro tatake with caviar was fantastic, the Fugu was interesting, and those are honestly the only two courses I can remember standing out from things I've tasted in my lifetime.I'd much prefer dining at Okada (LV) or any Nobu before I went back to Masa. It was an enjoyable experience, but definitely not worth the hype., Take the $ factor out, and it is very fresh therefore great sushi. But that's all I have to say about it. It's nothing out of the ordinary. I've seen it all being a foodie and will travel far for food. I love blowfish, it's delicate and translucent. But the accompanying sauce of soy and vinegar is too strong IMO. I would like to see it paired with something lighter like kumquat juice and lime zest, or champagne and pineapple juice. So I've sampled all 4 of the 3 michelin star restaurants, and I like this more than Jean Georges. If it's fresh sushi alone, it does deserves 3 star. More details here at my blogsite from my profile., As if the food at Masa weren't such stuff as dreams are made, I enjoyed lunch there with an old friend whom I hadn't seen in twenty years and who has become even more delightful with the passing of time. Talk about an embarrassment of riches. And apparently, Masa opened for lunch just to accommodate us. Surprisingly, having the entire restaurant to ourselves was not in the least bit strange or off-putting. Just serene. It's funny that I'm writing this review on what would be Darwin's two hundredth birthday, since the it's really the evolution of species that give the cuisine at Masa it's jaw-dropping majesty (no, I wouldn't consider that an overstatement.) Many, many fish and crustaceans taste really, really good, even without human assistance. Masa Takayama and his acolytes are clearly masters of their craft, but that craft is more about honoring raw materials than reinterpreting them. The cuisine at Masa is perhaps the definitive example of Less Is More--well, with the possible exception of adding gold leaf to the fugu. Yes, Masa is freakishly expensive. And yes, in my opinion, it's worth every cent. Your mileage my vary, but I don't want to hear about it. Now I'll get out of the way and let Masa do the talking:1. Ginko nuts, kissed with salt--the nuts grown in Central Park2. Japanese hairy crab, yuzu, cucumber, shiso leaf, chrysanthemum buds (served in a large, chilled cast-iron tower)3. Tartare of blue fin tuna, California Oesetra-variety caviar, toast points4. Fugu (!) sashimi, shisho flowers, soy, and yuzu, garnished with gold leaf (!), served in a hollow shell of raw basalt (I was a fugu virgin prior to this moment. I'm glad I got to try it, and glad I didn't die before my hashi hit the floor. To tell the truth, I'm not sure it would be worth an agonizing death. But maybe.)5. Fried fugu collar ( I had initially thought this cut was rib, but now I've reconsidered)6. Uni risotto, black truffle (sublime)7. O-toro sashimi, freshly grated wasabi (surprising texture, body; fat content off the charts)8. Chu-toro sashimi (we were ordered to not chew these; they obligingly melted in the mouth without mastication9. Shabu shabu of Japanese grouper, sliced thin and wrapped around thin slices of duck foie gras, fine julienne of scallion, dashi kombu ( the shabu shabu apparatus was remarkable: a heavy ceramic column with a celadon glaze that enclosed smoldering charcoal, a thin cast iron bowl, and a lid that matched the column)10. The broth of the shabu shabu, returned as soup(What follows is all nigiri unless noted)11. Chu-toro12. Tuna sinew, lightly grilled, tangle of scallions, back truffle paste13. Aji (amazingly fresh--I mistook it for tai)14. Fluke fin (amazing--I have never seen fins totally deboned; flavor was entrancingly assertive)15. Needle fish, nori (while our itame prepared most everything himself, he summoned a helper to lay sheets of nori on the counter for him)16. Ika17. Scallop, lightly grilled, another flavor that I simply couldn't place18. Okinawan sweet shrimp19. Toro maki20. Red clam, finely shredded cucumber, wrapped in thinly sliced cucumber21. Shitake mushroom, grilled and seasoned22. Uni, nori23. Unagi24. Insanity: through out the meal, a single black truffle the size of a grapefruit sat like a lump of coal next to the wasabi rhizome and a chunk of crystal halite like a tiny Washington Monument, all in a tray off to the side. For this offering, our itame grated off a good ounce of the thing, balled up some warm rice, and just packed on the truffle slices. The final product was like a truffle SnoBall. Hilarious, and giddy-making in that way only eating too much of something opulent can be.25. Chrysanthemum buds, shiso leaf, lotus root, plum paste (no rice)26. Japanese musk melon and roasted barley teaOh, and the bar itself: on vast slab of hinoki cypress, sanded smooth. Hands down the sexiest thing I have ever touched that didn't have a pulse., The most over rated dining experience in NYC? I think so. For a party of two this place will cost you essentially the same amount as two trips to Per Se (obviously not if you go for a couple bottles of Chd2teau Mouton Rothschild at Per Se). I visited this place on a Saturday night at it was dead - only a handful of people sitting at the bar.To summarize this overpriced, terrible experience:While the food was interesting it seems to me you are paying the entry price just to have Fugu and its just not worth it. The staff is militant (put that camera away!) and the overall dining experience similar to that of grabbing a late night dog at the Wiener Circle in Chicago (Yelp it if you don't understand the context).I will never return to this place (hello! you can go to Per Se nearly twice for a single visit here!) and given the current economic conditions and the apparent health of this place on a Saturday night I give it less than a year., I took my girlfriend here while we were on vacation. Delicious spot but dddaaayyaaaaam expensive. When we were there, we didn't see any couples. It was all business people closing that million dollar deal. They probably thought I was a rockstar since I walked in wearing very casual clothes with a backwards baseball cap and exposed tattoos. Little did they know I had no idea it was one of the most expensive restaurants in the world. Haha Well, after drinks, the meal cost me $1500 (w/ tip) for two. No matter how much money I make, I would never come here on a regular basis. Great food and great service but not sure if it was worth $1500 for two people on a regular basis. Without drinks, I think you can maybe get away with around $1200 with tips for two. If you make good money, I think you should atleast experience this once. Life is short., for $500+ pp, it's a meh. great quality of food, but service is inconsistent. you'd think you'll get full after 500 dollar worth of food, right? i had to order additional sushi, and it was like $60/bite. not worth it. but if you want experience this, or if anybody is taking you here, don't hesitate to go., 'Like a few people have stated this place is expensive. I have no regrets. The salmon roll with caviar was delicious. Ankimo was some of the best I have tried. Delicious uni. The fish here was extremely fresh and the preparations were done very well. Very nice sake selection. When I get back to NY I will return.', 'Aside from clearly being a convenient option for respite when shopping at the Time Warner shopping center, this place has overpriced and undersized sushi and other decently authentic Japanese cuisine. Having eaten here once right after a trip to Tokyo and then again when I was not so setup for disappointment, the consistency of my experiences renders my opinion fairly simple: If you want to impress someone with your ability to buy expensive dishes, which are admittedly artistically presented but not exceptionally tasting, go to Masa. In more detail, I have had some of their hot dishes (miso cod and tuna steak), both of which were slightly oily though extremely fresh. The same freshness standard holds with their sushi, which in my opinion, is a better choice from this restaurant. As a notice, a basic sushi sampler runs about $80. Finally, the ambience and atmosphere, which is spoiled given its somewhat commercial location, colors, and service, is not reflective of the luxurious image this restaurant attempts to emanate. The service is just friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable, adding to an albeit good but hardly unique experience. My ability to recommend this restaurant is only compromised by the fact that the overall taste and experience is not a great value for the cost of the meal.', I had this review filed under the wrong restaurant....blasphemy I know but enough sake and things get a bit blurry. Sometimes a restaurant blows your wildest expectations out of the water, Masa is one of those places.While I haven't been here in a few years, I remember the bluefin toro was the most incredible thing i'd ever laid my taste buds on! Besides my recent experiences with Foie Gras..... Your tongue will glide through his masterful cuts like a knife through a warm stick of butter. Masa was the first place I had the chance to try live sea urchin, to this date nothing else has even come close. The way he prepared it was transcendental, in a heavenly taste bud tingling ephiphoric way! The sushi bar is small and intimate it's limited to about 5-10 people, and believe it or not even with the $$$$ price tag you will need to make reservations far in advance. Masa has a 3 star michelin rating, but I can only honestly give them 4 of big yelp 5. As stated by others it's ridiculously pricey, i mean were not digesting diamonds or gold..... I caught a glimpse of the 1400+ bill for 2 people! Sorry but no sushi~sake experience is worth that price even if it's the best in the US. Get out your AMEX black card out.... you'll need it at Masa, fortunately for me I wasn't paying!!, 'This was a night beyond anything I have experienced.While I consider myself to be somewhat of a foodie, the prospect of finding myself in NYC with sooooo many choices of where and what to eat can be more than a little daunting. I like to picture myself in a cross legged yoga like pose with palms up and give myself over the food gods of NYC to somehow direct me to my next culinary adventure.I had plans to meet a good friend to catch up for drinks and a bite to eat. She had business client in town who very cordially invited her to dinner and when she told him about our plans, he insisted I join them. I had not heard about Masa other than they said it was good sushi. Sounded great to me, and I am always more than happy to meet a new friend. I set out to go and meet them for drinks at the Mandarin Oriental.After a wonderful glass of wine, we set out next door for Masa. I should have known how special the culinary delights I was about enjoy were by the hushed tones and the quiet sophistication from the moment we walked past the sheer crimson curtain. We were seated before Masa himself and as soon as we ordered our Champagne, the first course was set before us.Delight of all delights, our meal was started with Toro tartare with Sterling Royal caviar served on sweet japanese toast - really? Yuuuuum, next was the Fugu sashimi salad with ponzu dressing followed by a trio of Fugu dishes, Fugu collar and Fugu LiverWhite fish followed by Mochigome Zosui (a seaweed dashi-risotto made from mochi rice) garnished with shaved black trufflesSakura Masu (ocean trout) and Eringi mushroom nabe (konbu dashi)Toro fatty tuna (line caught boston big eye tuna)Shimaaji (striped jack)Hirame (fluke)Tai (sea bream)Kinmedai (gold eye sea bream)Ika (squid)Amaebi (Boston sweet shrimp)Suji (toro sinew grilled to perfection on sumi binchotan robata)Saba (mackerel)Aoyagi (red clam)Uni (hokkaido sea urchin gonads)Anago (sea eel)Unagi (fresh water eel)Kobe Beef grilled on robataBlack truffle nigiri (rice balled rolled on bed of shaved black truffles)Negitoro maki (minced otoro and onion roll)Soba Cha (buckwheat tea)I am borrowing here from some of my fellow yelpers for spelling and translations on some of these courses as I was in such food bliss that I had a tough time remembering all of the lovely morsels placed before me. I do remember a lot of Fugu, a lot of shaved truffles, delicate layered flavors and at one point shaved gold. Yes shaved gold!I am still reeling from the amazing evening, the amazing food and the amazing company.', Great sushi and service for sure.No complaints for food quality and service.But...it is too expensive and difficult to get a seat without very advanced reservation - like two months for Fri, Sat.I agree that sushi/sashimi is very best quality; so is chef Masa's skills...but I can visit Sushiden three times with this price., I admit to not having very high expectations for this place - it's in a mall for crying out loud. Yes, I know Per Se is right across the way, but come on. We're in a mall!I have never spent more for two teeny tiny pieces of fish before in my life. $4 per slice, each slice measuring about an inch and a half across and a quarter inch thick. They were smaller than dominoes, no joke. It was good fish, yes, but. . . really? $8 for two itty bitty fish pieces?The avocado and cucumber roll was the best I've ever had - big pieces of avocado, cucumber sliced so matchstick thin that it must be grated or something when it's frozen, and very little rice. But $14? Now you're just messing with me, right?The manager(?) however must have been part concierge as after chatting for a bit and realizing I was a foodie, he went off and printed out (on Masa letterhead of course) a list of fantastic fine dining options that I might want to try, and included his phone number in case I had any questions. Now THAT is service.Overall; fantastic sushi at sell your soul prices. I'm a fan as long as I'm not on a budget., This is the epitomy of fine Japanese. The decor is small and intimate yet feels quite spacious. Despite the sushi bar seating there is plenty of room. There have been so many reviews on the food so I will just bring up my favorites- the toro tartar is to die for, the toast points the best I ever had, and the osetra caviar topping is fantastic. I have had toro tartar at Morimoto, Nobu 57, etc but nothing compares to this. The best toro tartar I have experienced in my life. The shiso corn dish is fresh and exquisite, the toro sashimi etheral. There are many high end pieces not served at other sushi places such as white truffle sushi and several dishes with maitake mushroom. A couple of pieces such as the amaebi and aoyagi were tasty but comparable to the ones at Kuruma zushi. The Korean prep chef, Nick, was happy to demonstrate how the sashimi is all prepped differently depending on the piece. It seems no one has mentioned the cocktails but they deserve their own section. You might wonder if a $35 price tag on a cocktail is justified but these are more like liquid magic. The strawberry martini was amazing- rum mixed with elderflower (my favorite) and strawberries. The berries are juiced by hand and thismakes the drinks so much better than anywhere else. The raspberry cocktail with fresh raspberries, shiso, and Laurent Perrier was perfect as well as a blueberry cocktail with citron vodka and fresh blueberries. My favorite was the strawberry though- luscious!The dessert whore in me would have liked to see some variety of desserts but there was only an icy sweet melon (granted one of the best melons I've had). I left comfortably full- not rolling out the way you would from a French place. Flash photography isn't allowed but I did get a couple pictures. Before complaining about the prices let's consider the fact that Chef Masa is the only 3 star Michelin chef who works himself in the kitchen every single day. He could easily sell out and have a much bigger restaurant, multiple locations, franchise etc. The serenity and intimacy would be lost and the quality would be watered down. There is beauty in the simplicity and seemed effortlessness. To dine here is a great priviledge., This review dates back to 2004. We ate here to celebrate our engagement, the evening of the proposal.We ate at Masa's restaurant in LA (Ginza Sushi Co.) for my 25th birthday and had amazing fugu (blowfish) dishes. But this was our first time in the new NYC establishment.The beautiful door was made from a 2500 yr old piece of wood. I loved the plates and cups. They are made in Tochigi prefecture and are beautiful examples of mashiko pottery. The cups had a sensual texture to them and I have been searching for something similar ever since, rough and unglazed, and designed such that your lips are forced to curve when pushed against the cup (this helps prevent spillage).Here is a list of the courses we enjoyed:1. hairy crab from northern Japan with Japanese cucumber and tade (spicy sprout)2. toro tartare with osetra caviar and chives, with toasts3. aji salad with mioga (Japanese ginger) and shiso flowers4. kobe beef with fresh wasabi, lime, and sansho (Japanese pepper)5. shabu-shabu/sukiyaki-style dish with raw fois gras and raw lobster; hot broth flavored by stewing lobster claw; included green onion and dipping sauce 6. after the lobster and fois gras were eaten from the above, we were served the broth as soup. --- still one of the most amazing dishes I've had in my entire life7. toro nigiri8. toro nigiri9. shima-aji nigiri10. shima-aji nigiri11. squid nigiri, with orange zest12. amaebi nigiri13. grilled scallop nigiri14. grilled shitake nigiri15. akagai red clam nigiri16. saba nigiri17. hamo (sea eel) nigiri18. toro maki19. grilled toro nigiri20. grilled toro nigiri21. salmon roe nigiri22. uni nigiri23.

Sayori (Japanese needlefish) nigiri with shiso flowerMasa was friendly enough and happy to let us take a photo with him., 'The food is undeniably good, but not exemplary, and I can rate this place without factoring in cost. $400/head w/o drinks is ludicrous. When I can go to Corton, Eleven Madison Park, Le Bernadin, etc. and get better food for literally 1/4 the price...I gotta score this place low. There are at least 10 restaurants in NY that I think have -- cost aside -- superior food, and all but one (Per Se) is a fraction of the cost. Also, Ie got some greivances with the service/decor. Pretty standard. I not one to sign up for gaudy decor and overbearing service...but if I paying $400 for food there better be some weight to the experience. I got none here.', i came in with very low expectations from what friends said and with the weird 20% mandatory house charge on top of the price fix, before tip. i thought it'd be like yasuda which i think is awful (we sat in front of yasuda-san once and all he did was talk about himself and how the way he did things was superior. and it's seriously a sushi factory where it seems like they're trying for a guinness world record for number of sushi rolled out in a minute. and it's noisy. i couldn't wait to leave). anyway, we had a blast. the food was amazing. i don't think there was a whole lot we hadn't eaten before (sushi azabu has similar sushi offerings i.e. not california rolls) but here they shave truffles on everything which never hurts. the ambiance is great too. it's a small place and the counter isn't crowded and it's not too noisy. we sat in front of masa-san and made small talk with another sushi chef too. masa-san was really friendly and suggested we take a picture with him after dinner. everything was done so meticulously, service is impeccable. at dinner the next night at per se, i couldn't stop thinking about our masa dinner. uni risotto with truffles. chopped toro with osetra caviar. i saw the credit card bill the next day and it was more than i thought but masa is closer than a 14hr flight to japan and cheaper. the omi wagyu (even the fat has flavor) was a $125 surcharge but who's keeping track., 'Will ruin other sushi restaurants for you. It was an experience, literally, rather than just a meal. Group of six diners and everyone was blown away.', 'I honestly would not have particularly remembered the restaurant if it hadn been for the bill. The food was delicious, excellent. But food is often excellent at fine restaurants. The creativity of the stoneware was fantastic and it is special that they were created by the chef himself.The only trouble is justifying the price. There is no way $1200 for dinner for two, with only two $15 glasses of wine, can make sense.We have been fortunate to dine at many of the finest restaurants in the world. The cost of the meal here is simply out of line.One usually has a decent feel of what price range to expect based on experience. We usually play a little guess the total game and hit it within $5 or so.When the bill arrived my husband opened it and said, holy s**t. I looked up and asked what was wrong. He looked at me and said, There a comma. I thought he was kidding. No joke.Did I mention the tip is automatically added for your convenience?Anyway, the place was nice, but please. We had a great meal at the Spice Market (nearby) that was completely memorable on food and decor alone for the price of what came after the comma...literally $1000 less expensive.', Masa is a true experience for any lover of Japanese cuisine. I had dinner at the sushi counter, served by Chef Masa himself with a friend in February 2009 and was wowed. Concentrating on the food only, without taking into account the ambiance or price, I would say the appetizers were some of the best I have ever had (including a fried fugu dish that was almost unbelievably good) but the sushi was not always miles above what I have tasted at various other top sushi restaurants. There was a noticeable difference with some pieces particularly the toro, Tasmanian trout and uni (delicately settled in a lightly toasted, perfectly seasoned sheet of seaweed) and these exceptions were enough to garner my praise and devotion. Almost as noteworthy as the food is the nearly performance art nature of the creation and service. Masa's staff is almost invisible, even when they do speak, it is hardly above a whisper, their movements are fluid and overall the impression is that of a calming breeze. Chef Masa and his companion chefs behind the sushi bar create their dishes and sushi pieces with quiet confidence in small measured movements. This is not the kind of meal for people who enjoy flashy showmanship or flowery shows of grandeur. This entire experience is about forgetting the rest of the world exists, forgetting that there is a life outside of the walls of Masa, so that your mind is empty of all thoughts but the gastronomical experience before you. Allow yourself to sink into it and Masa's food may well be the way to Nirvana. Just have someone else pick up that check ;), My experience at Masa was pheominal. I devoured my lobster, and salivated over the steak on the rocks with the cognac sauce! Tuna Tartar, the finest i've placed on my palate. A necessary stop when I come to town., 'NYC is full of superlative restaurants & Masa can be counted in the highest echelons. some of the best sushi, sashimi have had this side of the Pacific. Served best at the Sushi counter & a very hustle & bustle vibe but in a good way. You feel energised & Satisfied after eating here. It is of course crazy expensive but the charm is in all the little details like the China that the food is presented & served on. Wonderful!!! i highly recommend the Fatty Tuna & The Sea Urchin, so many times outside of Japan these are pale imitations of the real Thing, but here at Masa they are works of art.', 'Only had to put my reservations in about 3 weeks before to be able to get a table on a night I needed! Woo! Totally worth it - if you love sushi you have to check out Masa.', I went to Masa about 5 years ago (in 2005, before it was elevated to three star Michelin status and even before Michelin did rankings for New York restaurants), and it so far remains the best restaurant--of any cuisine--that I have been to.For starters, the hinoki wood counter is so smooth and soft (well, relatively soft) to the touch that it adds to the dining experience in itself. If ever I were forced to make a blanket out of wood, I'm going with the counter at Masa. Second, the sushi course was easily the best sushi I have ever had. The servings might not be as big as most people expect, but it is both very high quality (apparently being flown in from Japan) and inventive (I distinctly remember sushi covered with white truffle shavings among other creative items). I can't recall the other dishes I had except for blowfish--which, personally, I did not find particularly remarkable, although notably I am still alive--and a bone cracker item that I thought was a miss.The service was excellent--always attentive but never intrusive--and very formal and respectful. I've never been to Japan, but I've never seen anyone bow as deeply as the staff at Masa. The downside, of course, is that Masa is very expensive. Our omakase dinner clocked in at $350 per person, not including tip and sake, with the final bill somewhere in the neighborhood of $1,000 for two people. Still, despite the price, I think it's worth a visit if you're a fan of Japanese food., 'Masa is a great restaurant and you have to make reservations. It is a little out of the way but well worth the trip. Most restaurants you go to you think that you could recreate the dish at home. At Mesa, you have a dish that you have never tried and would probably not have again. Last I went, I had a bell pepper full of quinoa and parmesan and other ingredients that were so delic. Though I took a client there, I want to go back with friends.', A wonderful experience for sushi aficionado's :)The first thing you notice at the sushi bar is the table. It's made out of one slab of wood and the staff shave it down nightly to keep the texture smooth and clean. Then you notice that the care that is taken to treat the table is just a mere glimpse into the preparation they take to serve you. There was so much attention to detail that I wasn't sure if I should eat my omakase meal or simply take pictures of it. The food was that perfect.The quality was superb. Toro was piled everywhere and ingredients are shipped directly from Japan. Beluga caviar served on tiny pieces of toast, sashimi served in an individual shabu shabu broth, and spoonfuls of uni consorts were a few of their delights. One dish in particular stood out: the A5 Wagyu beef that is an added $100 for about 6 slices was literally the best beef I've every had. To this day I still remember how the beef literally melted on my tongue. The truffle salt enhanced the flavor just so slighty, immediately making my mouth water as I tried to savor every last bite. I have yet to find a restaurant that serves Wagyu beef as decadently as Masa does. The last platter looked like a boat of Toro to me but by that time I was too full to enjoy any of it!, Sigh, when I think about this place, I can't help but think it's another one of those places (which are particularly prevalent in Manhattan, let's be honest) that's really about the hype and the name and not really about the food. First of all, let me be clear: the food was fine, but it's NOT the real deal (ie what you get in Japan) in that Masa will just put a ton of expensive WESTERN ingredients into the meal to justify the price. Think caviar, foie gras, and a ton of shaved truffles. Yes, that stuff is great and I am fond of it as well, but THAT IS NOT AUTHENTIC JAPANESE. So for all of you out there who swear by this place, first of all, you're probably not Japanese, let alone Asian. And second, you probably have never been to Japan and have no idea what you're talking about. For $400 pp I rather go to Japan., 'I liked the bento box but it was a little cold. Great early bird special.', Probably the BEST and most expensive meal I've had in my life. Love the minimalist decor and the fact that there are only 10 tables (or maybe even less??)The food was incredible. FRESHEST of FRESH ingredients. Even though the dude next to us was rather rude, and told the waiter as he left with his date that he thought the restaurant was a rip-off. How unclassy.It was an EXQUISITE meal and I really do mean exquisite., 'Masa is definitely something to experience at least once in your life. The restaurant is intimate and the staff is very friendly. The food was phenomenal, something that I have never had anywhere else. The whole experience from the wait staff to watching them prepare the food was wonderful. The attention to detail and the freshness of the food was superb. It is pricey but worth it. Will be returning again.', My dinner at Masa was the most expensive meal I have ever had and I can't say that it was worth it. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I didn't think the experience was life-changing in the way that phenomenal meals can be.The bill for our party of six was dizzying. The base price for the food and drink was insane, but added to that was a 20% house charge that didn't include tip. It feels bad to be nickel-and-dimed anywhere, but when the nickels and dimes are more like bands of Benjamins, it feels all the worse. I don't like when reviews obsess about pricing, but Masa was a ripoff.That said, it was a wonderful meal. If it were half the price, it would be an easy five stars. The service was fantastic. We were treated with the best of care, with each course beautifully presented and dutifully explained. Our dinner was near my graduation and the sommelier gave me a shot of Koshino Kanbai sake to acknowledge the occasion. My dessert also came with a bottle-shaped candle.The space was elegant, with a lovely pool, flower arrangements, and smooth tables made of single blocks of wood. The restaurant was small and intimate, and surprisingly, only half full.The food was awesome. We started with unagi and cucumber, which tasted clean with some mild ginger. Next was the toro tartare with caviar. This was a stunner, balanced and bursting with a great briny aftertaste, served with little toasts that looked like mochi. Third was suzuki sashimi with ponzu and little greens. The fish was firm and clean and the ponzu had a yuzu tartness. Then came an okoze karaage, a Japanese fish served tempura style with fried yomogi. The fish had a wonderful light texture and the yomogi was a fragrant garnish. The fifth course was the uni risotto with summer truffle, and it was superb. The truffle was subtle and papery and didn't actually add that much to the rich luscious risotto. For a supplement, we got two orders of the ohmi beef tataki with summer truffle and seaweed salt. This was beautiful meat, leaner than Kobe and purely flavorful. The last pre-sushi dish was a hamo shabu shabu. Each of us got a pot of hot konbu broth with a fire underneath, and we were instructed to cook the fish ourselves. The hamo was delicious, warm and mild, like unagi but with a little more spring. After cooking, we dipped it in a refreshing cucumber vinaigrette, and to round out the course, we mixed vinaigrette and broth for a tart warming soup.The rest of the meal was sushi, and each bite was stellar. The rice is better at Yasuda, but the fish was fresh and exquisite. The sushi were presented on long black boards placed in the middle of our table, and we were given slates with soy sauce and ginger, as well as lemon water and an oshibori for our fingers.We got two pieces each of the bluefin toro, and this was probably the best toro I've ever had, unctuous and amazing, melting with just a push of the tongue. Next came firm shimaaji and meaty, slightly chewy hirame. Board three brought utterly buttery kinme and its firmer relative tai. Aoyagi and ika with Himalayan salt came next. The clam was surprisingly soft, with almost no chew, and the squid lacked its usual gross slipperiness and had a nice shiso flavor. A trio of saba, grilled toro suji, and grilled shiitake followed. The saba was boldly fishy, and the toro sinew with scallion was fantastic, with a rich smokiness highlighted by the freshness of the negi. I'd never had shiitake sushi before and it was stunning, very smoky and subtly bitter. Next came the eels - white anago with seaweed salt and unagi wrapped in cucumber. The anago was nice and meaty and the salt was a perfect accompaniment. The unagi was insane, with a roasted flavor and a hint of tare sweetness without any visible sauce. At this point we were given a great green tea then presented with a board of awabi and uni. The awabi was miraculously thin yet firm, with great resistance for such a gorgeously cut piece. The uni was incredibly silky, and the nori gave great contrast. The eighth round of sushi brought summer truffle with truffle oil and negitoro. The truffle was a blast of luxurious flavor and the negitoro was refreshing with a small crunch of negi. Last was a palate cleanser sushi with pickled lotus root wrapped around shiso with ume. It was perfect, with strong flavors that mixed into something clean and harmonious.We were given finger bowls and roasted rice tea before a simple dessert of juicy cherries followed by a multi-layered crepe cake with chestnut. This was moist and not too sweet, with a flavor similar to cream puffs.Despite my whining, I can't say I didn't enjoy Masa. The appetizers were delicious and the sushi was some of the best I've ever had. That said, Yasuda is at the same level, with better rice, and much cheaper. While I don't regret my experience, I wouldn't go again and would hesitate to recommend it to anyone without a sheaf of cash to burn., The food was very fresh but the overall experience was disappointing. I already knew that Masa was the most expensive restaurant in NYC going into the establishment, but the 20 percent surcharge on top of the tip made me feel cheated. After going to Per Se which is also in the Time Warner building, this dining experience felt disappointing. For the price that you pay for Masa after leaving tip and the surchage, you could've literally ate at almost all of the restaurants in the Time Warner building; excluding Per Se. My bill with the tip wound up to be $1600 for two people. For that price, we could've almost flown to Japan to eat sushi.The sushi was excellent but the experience was a thumbs down., 'This goes beyond a meal. This was an experience. An incredibly expensive meal, but if you think about it as an experience, then it all gets subjective at that point. Foie Gras shabu shabu. To die for. Truffles everywhere, in everything. The sushi was literally made according to our tastes. Our sushi chef clarified our likes and dislikes and went with it. The sake was recommended impeccably as well. This was a fantastic experience. Expensive but fantastic.', I'd come back again. Most expensive meal in my life, but most amazing experience, especially getting to meet chef masa and have him wish us a happy anniversary! Only reason for 4 stars is it's price. It costs the same as my airfare from LA to NYC and back!!! But I loved every second of it!!!, 'As seen on their receipt...The 20% service charge is not a gratuity and is not distributed to the service staff but is used to cover operating expenses...It popular belief that the cost or price of your meal represents the operating costs of the restaurant. Anything above the cost of your meal goes to the wait staff for doing a good job. It insulting as a customer and I feel sorry for your staff to have to endure this policy. I going to avoid this restaurant and recommend my friends do as well.', Simply put: Probably the most memorable meal I've ever had. 27 courses, starting with hot Japanese specialties, an optional Australian Wagu beef course, sukiyaki made with specialty small fish (that, apparently you can only get about a month out of the year) and ending with the most amazing, melt in your mouth, pre-seasoned sushi... I can't wait to save up enough to go again.|3
33|michael-mina-san-francisco|'Wow--what an experience to be in the hands of the Michael Mina team! You are greeted by an elegant and gracious staff, the service is perfectly sychronized, and the tastings--signature Michael Mina. Everything comes in trios (yes, there is that suggestion of menage a trois...in every bite)--one selection rendered three different ways (foie gras--YES--you have lived if you have had the foie!!!) This is a top destination for popping the question, an anniversary, or to impress out-of-town clients. The decor is a little too sparse and even cold (everything is in bone/ecru/ivory), but Michael Mina probably likes the feel of a blank canvas--a necessary backdrop for his culinary creations.', Foodie alert. This place is bangin'... from it's primo location in the lobby of the Westin St. Francis Hotel, to the impeccable service and finally, the exceptionally innovative and perfectly prepared food. Our party decided on the two tasting menus, paired with wine. Each course arrived at our table like a present to be opened: a gorgeous tower of tuna tar tar and caviar, a mini lobster pot pie and little pillows of foie gras. My only regret is that the wine clouded my ability to hang on to all the details ... so the meal hangs in my mind with the aura of one beautiful dream., 'While I agree that the atmosphere was a bit sparse, the towering columns lent it an air of decadence, and decadent it was. The food was beautifully crafted and each dish presented a melody of flavors. The Lobstor Pot Pie was truly delicious, and the Banana Tartine with Ginger Ice cream was both familiar and exotic at the same time. I highly recommend the seasonal tasting menu and definitely the wine pairing.', What a treat!!! I even took pictures of each dish. Every time our waiter brought out a course, a detailed description would also follow. If you enjoy a tasting menu, and don't mind that he plays on the number 3 (crab bisque 3 ways, chocolate cake 3 ways, or veal 3 ways) this is the hot new restaurant to check out! The service was suburb, the food was incredible, and the atmosphere was elegant. The petite fours were little chocolate bon bons with chocolate or vanilla ice cream dipped in toffee. Delicious! I can't wait to go back!, 'Dining here brought the meaning of fine dining to a whole another level!!! This restaurant is truly a foodie heaven. The decor, presentation, service and food was absolutely wonderful! The each ingredient for each course is prepared in a trio. Each bite was different from the last. We started off with complimentary lobster trio from the chef. Lobster cerviche, lobster corndog and lobster w/ avocado. For my appetizer, my main ingredient was scallops. I had three huge juicy scallops, the first one was prepared with beets, the second was with sweet potatoe puree, and the last was prepared with caviar. All were delicious. The dish was also served with halibut trio as well. For my second course, I had the pan fried black bass. The first preparation was with japanese eggplant and basil, second was with ginger and bok choy, the last with prepared with coconut rice. All there tasty and delicious. My date had the trio duck with foie gras. I thought his was better than mine. The duck was so lean and flavorful. I loved how the portions of each style was small enough so you don get too full, so youl able to eat everything. Dessert was orgasmic!!!! I had the trio chocolate cakes with milk shake shots!! Oh man was the peanut butter the best!!! The cake was warm with peanut butter oozing out! The second one was banana cake and the last was bitter sweet chocolate. All three were yummy! It was like eating 3 totally different desserts! My date had the coconut as his trio. It was three tiny cakes: carrot, lemon, and chocolate coconut. The ice cream that it was served with was SO creamy and unique in flavor!! I loved it!!! The evening ended with two bon bons from the chef. Hazelnut flavor and cookies and cream flavor. The service was wonderful and attentive. This restaurant is my favorite! I love the idea that you are literally tasting various types of food. It was the best dining experience so far!!', 'As a foie gras lover and a person often loves to digging out food from other plate (that called sharing),it goes without saying Michael Mina is up in my alley! Foie gras was so yummy, and i love my everything prepared 3-6 diff. ways!', Have so far only done desserts and cocktails here, but was impressed. Despite the dimensions it still seems fairly intimate thanks to some good design choices. Desserts were petite but just right, some nice cocktails, though the dessert wine selection was very limited, there ought to be a port cheaper than $20 for heaven's sake. The staff were very personable and accommodating. Will definitely try dinner there, once I arrange a bank loan., One of the best dinners I have enjoyed on a stolen credit card. Actually it was Maria's; thanks sweetie. Michael Mina perfects his craft in a historic setting within Union Square. The service is genuinely personable and professional. The excoriating detail of each dish presentation is an education in and of itself. One of my top ten dinning experiences I have had in San Francisco. Beware that you may need to bring you home equity line check book with you if you are treating a large group., Food and service were absolutely incredible. Seasonal tasting menu was phenomenal and the complexity and depth of the flavors was eye-opening. Service was an professional yet personable without even a hint of snobbishness. If you are having either of the tasting menus, I highly recommend ordering a half-bottle of white wine, a glass of sauterne for the foe gras course, and then another half-bottle of red to finish. The half-bottle selection is wonderful. The only disappointment was the room itself. I had heard to so much about how beautiful it was. My date and I both agreed that is very bland and didn't look much fancier than any high-end hotel dining room. Not even close to the interior design of Fluer de Lys or even the remodeled La Folie, but who cares. I would eat that food in outhouse and be happy., Wonderful experience all around. As others have mentioned, the menu divides its items into seasonal and classic options for every course. Each seasonal item involves a single ingredient -- say, scallops -- prepared six different ways or else two ingredients prepared three ways; the classic offerings are the tried-and-true constants of the menu that will be familiar to guests of Michael Mina's former home, Aqua. The standard tasting menu includes three courses, but our waiter made sure to note that guests are free to order a small course between the starter and main courses if they so desired. We exercised the demi-course option and enjoyed the ahi tuna tartare, which was vibrant, in both color and flavor, while carefully balanced -- no overbearing wasabi here -- but this additional food proved excessive given that the three courses, with their petite yet surprisingly filling portions, would likely have sated our appetites by themselves. Those who are generally averse to foie gras, as I am, should make an exception for Michael Mina's rendition -- it may be reason enough to come to the restaurant; it may be reason enough to become a fan of the restaurant. The John Dory entree was very good but not something I have a strong urge to order again, while the strawberry dessert presented in six distinct incarnations -- rhubarb, marshmallow, oatmeal crisp, caramel, bread pudding and fudge -- was my favorite of the ones we ordered. The service was excellent: our waiter was attentive and genial, polished but unaffected , and when a dish required some on-site preparation, a squadron of servers descended on the table to deliver, mix and present the food in an almost choreographed fashion. The bill came back a tad higher than we had expected, but -- surprise, surprise -- the cocktails we had before dinner, at twelve dollars a pop, were the sly culprits., Kinda of an odd restaurant setting. It's located in the SIr Francis Drake Hotel Lobby. He's the reason why Aqua is what it is today. Rich, flavorful food that is prepared with great care. It was Valentines day, so it was a set menu. Service was excellent and I had the best Gertzaminer wine there!, Simply put, this is the best restaurant in San Franciso right now. The classic tasting menu is perfect. I had the best meal there on my last birthday. If you're the sort of person who needs to be celebrating something to go out to a restaraunt of this caliber, let it be told that dining at such an establishment is reason enough to celebrate., 'Service, atmosphere, presentation...this restuarant defines fine dining. Make your reservations well in advance and be prepared for a 3 hour seating. The food was exceptional, especially the wonderful tasting menus that they offer.', Michael Mina, people. Save your pennies (and your dollars and your retirement fund) and make a reservation today. Bust it out for the six course tasting menu and get the wine pairings. Then you'll understand how a $500 meal can be worth every cent., 'Food is definitely on par with Gary Danko but, the acoustics suck and, the atmosphere not nearly as good.Had the fois gras (served 3 ways) as the first course excellent, had langostino for the second, and filet for the third all with truffle shavings. dessert was the 4th course being dessert...yum yumevery course came prepared 3 ways. Added a wine pairing for $45 which was superb. Excellent food and service, bad acoustics.', 'Raise your nose a bit when you walk in but be prepared for a fabulous feast. I left clenching my teeth so my food wouldn come back up...how is that possible with the three small tastings, an appy and dessert only? Up there with my Fifth Floor experience...both a must do in SF.', Luxurious...that's the only word needed to describe this very rare dining experience. Feel like a queen with her own staff waiting to fulfill her every need. Yummy champagne and amazing food. The presentation is spectacular., All of the classic dishes are still here, which is fantastic! coupled with the seasonal menu i have no complaints about the food itself which is sepctacular. However, each time that I've been to Michael Mina I've felt that there was a lack of tempo between courses. There would often be an uncomfortable wait somewhere between the 2nd and 3rd course. Memorable dishes: Scallops served three ways & tuna tartare the classic., 'Love the trio combination. Brought my boyfriend there for dinner and he absolutely loved it....great variety and definitely not an ordinary meal! The meals were delicious and picture worthy, so creatively done! :) Just an all-around wonderful experience! Check out the photos posted on this page!', 'Was treated to an amazing birthday dinner here last night. Between the two of us, we had the scallops, foie gras, skate wing, John Dory, cheese plate, and the chocolate for dessert. There was a lobster trio amuse to start, including the famous lobster corn dog, and egg nog and peppermint ice cream bon bons with the check. We also appreciated the wines of consequence section of the wine list, with some tasty selections for those of us who don want the wine to enter into the triple digits along with the food.The food and presentation were both impeccable (at this price, they better be!), but one star off for the service. We don believe in bottled water at restaurants, so we were dependent on the staff for refilling our ice (read: toilet ;)) water. At a place of this caliber, you shouldn have to ask the staff for ANYTHING -- but our glasses went unrefilled for quite some time. And it wasn our specific waiter fault, but a breakdown somewhere else along the line.', What is a Holiday season without a personal indulgence? So dinner at Michael Mina's Union Square restaurant was a necessary stop in December for me. An incredible tasting menu that included foie gras, lobster, rare rack of lamb, caviar, and a perfect wine pairing. At nearly $1000 for the four of us, this reviewer sincerely thinks the dining experience was worth it., 'All I can say is that I am glad we had the 5:30 seating time for the 6 course wine and food boxing match. I seriously felt like the kitchen staff was sparring with our appetites. What are these wimpy morsels doing on my plate?! Are they using surgical tools to make these Barbi deuvres?Then the Mina chefs came out with harder punches, then a left hook with the wine pairing. The wicked red wine lamb and syrah combination punch left us dizzy. By the time the 10th round came we felt like the plate we were looking at: cheese. NOTE: The 6 course sampler has like about 14 dishes that come one at a time with samplers on each. You can imagine the experience. We were drunk and stuffed and used the analogy of being punched out in the last round when we thought we were winning. It was excellent, and the staff was pleasant. No need to stop for food after eating at Michael Mina like other places. I would be pissed if I needed to get a Whopper after spending $600 for two people. Can wait to go back for a rematch!', One of my most memorable dining experiences in my life. I ate here before I moved here, over Christmas 04 while staying up the street at the Ritz. As a single diner as well as a fellow chef working at The French Laundry, I was treated as a VIP. I ordered the 6 course tasting with wine... ended up getting 15 courses. My waiter was perfect: professional, attentive but not overwhelming, and expert at his profession. Chef Mina's food was top notch.. everything cooked and presented flawlessly. The tableside preperations and plating is great for involving the diner in the experience. I definitly reccommend his place, but be prepared to spend A LOT. I spent almost $700... on myself. Cheers!!, Michael Mina is all about contrast and strong flavors that may overwhelm your taste buds. He likes to present plates in trios with a gradient of strength in flavors and textures with something sweet and salty to complement. His culinary creations are creative with the exception of desserts, which are made by someone else. Stick with the cheese plate to follow Mina's theme over the dessert plate. The sour apple sorbet is perhaps the only refreshing dessert on the tasting menu. Try his signature lobster pot pie at least once for the gourmet experience of being served at the table. Service is good, but the atmosphere is a bit noisy given one dines upstairs in the lounge area of a hotel., 'wow! probably one of the most fabulous dinners i have ever had in my life! everything from the ambiance of the room to the pace of the meal to the excellent hosts and waitstaff made this one of my favorites. my husband took me here for my birthday a couple of weeks ago. our waitress suggested the most amazing not super sweet reisling to start and my hubby picked out some great wine pairings to have with our meal. wee not big drinkers so that worked better than getting one bottle to share. we were served warm sourdough rolls and butter and started with an amuse-bouche of lobster prepared three ways, then we shared fois gras served six ways (3 poached and 3 sauteed) and scallops prepared 3 ways + 3 other seafood items as our first courses. i then had the rack of lamb prepared 3 ways with 3 huge tortellinis to accompany. he had the kobe beef roast as entrees. the beef was prepared seared and brasied 6 different ways. truly wonderful. then for dessert i had the apple trio and he had the citrus trio. il let you experience those for yourself. every bite of everything was divine and just enough to whet your appetite for the next sample. it is absolutely not cheap but is completely worth every penny. i didn think it was over the top at all...even though mina is a vegas boy. you have to try it!', 'Words cannot describe the food here. Everything was excellent. I celebrated my birthday here and the staff was wonderful and very attentive. At first I was apprehensive of this place, as I have read reviews of other restuarants that were rated high, but ended up being disappointing. Yet Michael Mina is a gem in this city. And the crowning touch to my night was the birthday treat the staff brought out for me.', 'Michael Mina Is Top Notch! My third dinner there with an ex-chef from 5 star resort was untouchable for great service and fantastic food. Michael prepares very playful trios of the best seasonal ingredients accompanied with creative sauces. Yes the decor is sparse. However, The Open, high ceilinged space has awesome columns. $$$$', I didnt' get to eat at the restraunt, but sampled the Onyx Lounge at the Westin for dessert last nite. The service is mediocre and seems to take forever. But, they have this peanut butter chocolate cup desser thing that is unbelievable. Basically, imagine a reeses peanut butter cup in a souffle with a milkshake. That's what makes this place wortwhile for me., 'I guess I did not get the service others did. Our main waiter was very impersonable and snooty. The super tooted lobster pot pie was forgettable. The dishes were good, but not good enough for the price, surcharge for lobster and a few other dishes. The restaurant lacks ambiance, and the evening I was there it was freezing! Next time I will try Gary Danko.', 'Holy decandence Batman!! I surprised my girlfriend with a trip to MM for her birthday. Amazing. From our first seat to our last treat this place was the bomb. Granted, like the Gap Band, the bill felt like a small nuclear device, but it was worth it. The explanations of the food were to the point and explanatory. The dessert was delicate without being filling. Highly recommended.', I've eaten here twice now and overall i wasn't disappointed. I'm always looking for unique taste combinations and Michael Mina does that well. The one thing is that all the food is very rich and your tastes buds can get somewhat deadened by the end of the meal. The deserts were too much and I left with my stomach feeling overwhelmed. Not sure I'll go there again on my own dollar. Twice seemed to be enough. The three course meal isn't too badly priced at $88 but the wine list has barely anything under $60. $7 for a cup of tea seems excessive too.Service was good although they forgot to bring the tea with dessert and we had to wait a while.Great for a one time experience. Maybe more if someone else is treating., One hell of a place to go when someone else is paying. The trio concept is a great way to taste a variety of flavors despite the small portions you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber. The wine list is amazing, again, if you're not paying. The decor (extremely high ceilings, corinthian theme) doesn't match the modern cuisine, but you just don't care about the decor when the food is so good. I would absolutely come back here., At this caliber of fine dining, the details are everything. So when I wasn't seated on time, and the birthday card on my plate had my name spelled incorrectly I was understandably displeased. Add to that the couple at the next table who were more interested in talking to me and my dinner companion than one another, and wait staff that hover but are ultimately unhelpful, and there you have a very expensive meal that leaves you seriously questioning just how much bang you got for your buck., 'Dear Michael, I am very sorry to have to give you this rating, but you must understand that when one pays $500 for dinner, they expect to be seated within at least 20 minutes of their reservation time, NOT 45 MINUTES LATER. Dear Michael, I am very sorry to have to give this rating, but when you make someone wait to eat until 10 pm on a Thursday night after they have gone to the gym, and had two bread rolls they aren hungry anymore, they are in a hypoglycemic coma and the food just doesn taste as good when you are in a coma. Dear Michael, I have been to many nice restaurants in this City, a fact that I cherish as dear to my heart and my unfortnately tiny checkbook, so when I go to fancy place i expect fancy service. Your service was average, AVERAGE, not special, no recommendations, no winks of collusion from the waitress, AVERAGE. With the number of staff people I saw running around, the service should have been impeccable. Dear Michael, is it the fact that the majority of your guests are from out of town and their standards are therefore below that of hard core local San Francisco Foodies that the experience was so three stars? Should I have flashed my license at your hostess before she smiled and said, wee running a little late. The food you sent over after 40 minutes was nice, but not that nice because it was only a result of my repeated, yet polite, inquiries into the status of our table. Dear Michael, I sorry, I will not be eating at your establishment again, at least until your prices reflect the treatment of the guests and the level of service. I cannot tell you how relieved I am that I ate here while someone else was footing the bill, if I had spent my tax return on my token big fancy annual dinner treat to myself, I would have wept openly at the table.', (just read the other Yelper's reviews on MM -- they are terrible with on-time seating for the second and third seatings of the night. If you got at 6:15, you'll be fine. Once I had a reservation at 8:15 and was not seated until 9. We were quite displeased).I've been to Michael Mina 6 times over the last 6 months, and I've enjoyed it every time. However, to be honest, the first few times were much better than the recent experiences. I most recently (4/8/06) went for my mother's birthday.The great part about Michael Mina is their seasonal menu, with foods served 3 ways. Basically, you have one centerpiece, served 3 ways. For example, one of my favorites (which seems to have been phased out this season) was the pan-seared black cod. Originally, this dish and others were plated on a single large plate with 3 separate smaller plates and prepared with different sides and sauces. I loved it. In a party of 4, this was much better than ordering the tasting menu.Recently it looks like they've started to manage portions a little better; no longer do you get 3 separate mini-plates on top of a large plate, there is now a large 3-partitioned plate with significantly smaller servings. However, I still couldn't make it through all the food.Things to remember: Do not eat too much bread; excellent bread, but you'll regret eating it. If you like fish, try the John Dory or black cod. Their new seasonal prawn dish is quite good as well. If you're a fan of root beer floats, that dessert is quite good. The chocolate seasonal dessert and banana seasonal dessert are good, but the creams that come on the side are a little too cloying.All in all, a great restaurant. I've been there too many times now but I'd still strongly recommend it., OVER PRICED for the food - $400 for 2 people with a bottle of wine ($100)i felt like it was a scam! for the $80/ 3 course meal they advertise, everything that I wanted to eat required additional surcharges...for instance ordering their signature lobster pot pie - i had to add $30.... if you are ok with paying the $$$$$$$$ then this is a great place to eat.3 course meal and you were required to order a dessert even if you preferred a different appetizer! there was nothing special about the dessert.good food but extremely rich. foie gras - but didn't like the cold version...very very small portions of cold and searedblack mussel souffle was awesome - but again got a little too rich for melobster pot pie - the signature dish - is amazing...but i had to add an additional $30 for this as my main entree!!, this place is definitely one of the TOP restaurants i've ever eaten at in s.f., maybe even my life. i loved it!FOOD: incredible, amazing, i felt like i was eating at the forefront of gourmet dining. i ordered everything as a trio b/c i love the concept of the trio. the great thing about trios is they're good for getting to sample many tastes & u really notice the flavors b/c they r serious Masters of Flavor here. but b/c the different tastes are clearly juxtaposed, u can't help but compare them w/one another & end up playing favorites. in that sense, the trio components are competing w/each other. all the flavors are top-notch, but i wouldn't recommend trio-ing everything b/c that's a lot of different flavors going on. plus since my friend & i split everything so we could try the different tastes, i wound up trying literally 31 different dishes! the serving sizes are small, which is expected, but everything obviously took a lot of thought, skill, creativity, and preparation to execute. some of the things are amaaazing. ~i really liked the lobster salad in the complimentary amuse bouche. ~my seared foie gras was yummy, the poached/cold foie gras not so much. ~the john dory was lovely & delicious but not as strong of a contrast in flavors, which the waiter warned me about. ~my friend had deeelicious sashimi. ~dessert was really a treat, & i liked the small servings here, the peanut butter shake, the sundae was to die for. michael mina's day off is on sundays, so of course i went on a sunday. that just means i have to go back when he's there!WINE: excellent but i had to limit myself due to a nasty hangover.SERVICE: they literally have a black-suited army of servers, bussers, captains, a brigade of 3 hosts. all in all, they have a staff of 60 per shift, with 20+ of them front of house, a massive operation, & i started thinking about their costs & expenditures in relation to pricing (couldn't help it!). the staff is really good-looking & smooth at their jobs. everyone i spoke to was nice & friendly, professional, & very competent. my friend was jazzed when i got up & left the table, they immediately replaced my napkin with a fresh one. that's what i'm talking about!BATHROOM: i asked the waiter if the bathroom was outside in the hotel, which it was, & he said he'd walk me there. he took me to the host stand & the hostess got out from behind the stand, walked down the stairs & directed me to the bathroom. i loved that! 2 people taking me to the bathroom?! i hate to impose, but the gesture was really appreciated. would be more impressive if they had their own bathroom in the restaurant b/c anybody off the street can use the hotel bathroom. in fact there was some chick hanging out in the parlor room who looked like that. i guess it's difficult to mess w/the plumbing in old historic bldgs.DECOR: i thought the decor was spectacular. it was kind of open & loud, but the setting is really grand. the lighting level was perfect, noticed & loved the eggplant ceiling which nicely complemented the gorgeous black marbled columns & gray/teal decor. nice glowing bar. they had these fabulous abalone shell plates which serve no purpose as they take it away immediately, which i've never experienced & goes against my pragmatic side. the columns & high ceilings were just really beautiful & left me w/the impression that this is one of the best dining experiences s.f. has to offer.OVERALL: WOW. great for special occasions or a really really really nice treat. one of the best eating experiences i've ever had., 'Took my wife for our anniversary and boy oh boy did I make the right move - after a dinner like this I should make it to my next anniversary!A good friend Brian is the GM but the service is so good here that it feels like you are a big shot the minute you walk in no matter who you know. The food was unreal, and I cannot say enough good things about the staff. Sure, it is a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for - basically this is a four hour culinary vacation. Save up a couple of bucks, make a reservation and GO. This is what city living is about. I am not even going to try to describe the food as words cannot do Micheals attention to flavors justice. Enjoy, and tell them Max sent you!', 'I absolutely love this restaurant! The whole dining experience was amazing. Fellas, this is a great 1st date, impress the ladies type restaurant!', 'So accomodating! I am a vegan that was visiting Michael Mina for a work dinner. I called ahead & warned them of my restirctive diet and though the woman on the phone was really nice, I was worried about what would be when it came time to order. I loved being in the historic St.Francis Hotel though I the decor of the restaurant was less than appealing. I hate beige. Michael Mina is very, very beige. Also, I kept thinking about what grand chandeliers probably used to be in place of the recessed lighting, but I digress.The wait staff was so nice - not a bit snobbish - & they serviced my vegan diet. Because I partook a bit too much in the wine I cannot remember all of the food details though they definitly described every dish in my SIX course meal very well. Ie never had asparagus or corn that tasted quite like this! Also, the desert platter they brought me was unbelievable. It was a lime sorbet with every fruit imaginable displayed in a way that made me wish I had my camera.I certainly recommend this place. A+', The atmosphere is quietly elegant, the service is impeccable, but the real reason to come here is for the food. It's like that scene in the Nutcracker in which Mary & the Nutcracker prince sit down and all of the people/animals/coffee/candies perform for them and they just absorb all of the visual artistry, one act more exotic and beautiful than the next. You feel that way at Michael Mina - here, sit down on this very pretty yet comfortable (Barbara Barry-designed) chair and we will delight and impress you with our culinary creations. I have to mention that we were a party of 10 people, and not once did we feel that we were waiting for courses, or for the rest of our party to be served - they magically appeared and just as magically were taken away, without our having to break our conversation. And props to the kitchen for accomodating our vegan diner seamlessly and inventively, so that her experience was as special as ours. We ordered the tasting menu with a wine pairing, so we knew that we were settled in for a few hours of gastronomic enjoyment. The tasting menu consists of seasonal selections including several of MM's famous trios, so there was a lot of variety and a lot of food. We were treated to not one but 2 amuse-buches, and yes, we were very amused. Standouts: trio of raw fish (tuna, hamachi, one other), scallops trio, lamb trio, chocolate dessert sampler Very good: langoustine trio (although the ceviche pairings were standout), duck (although the foie gras on this plate was standout) Could have been better: Wine pairing. Surprising. I liked the Riesling at the beginning and the muscat at the end. In between, I can't even remember the wines. Suggest you order your own. Table envy (dishes to try next time): 1/ Lobster pot pie - oh my goodness gracious me, we had finished our meal and were practically drooling at this dish being presented at a nearby table. It's an ENTIRE lobster in a pot pie. Definite last-meal-on-earth candidate. One of our dinner companions wanted to order it as his dessert! 2/ Roast chicken - I know, I know, how uninspired - but we saw one being served, and not only did it smell divine (the skin looked cracklin-good), the tableside carving was a show of expertise with a knife that would have made Jeffrey Dahmer proud. MmmmmMichael MmmmmMina, thanks for the MmmmMemories, 'EDIT: Went for dinner 12/06Despite reading reviews where diners had to wait for awhile for their tables even with reservations, my friend and I were seated right away. We were seated by the windows, far away from the lobby area. Their wine list is a tome, with most of the bottles over a $100 and a sizable number of famous wines over $1000. They do have a page of wine values where all the wines are below $100.We both ordered the tasting menu and the short story is that the both us were underwhelmed by the food. One of our favorite dishes was actually the amuse bouche, a plate of parsley flan and a ray oyster. Dishes on the tasting menu were:-Trio of Sashimi: Japanese fluke, tasmanian trout, and king amberjack. Like most people, we enjoyed the king amberjack the most.-Potato crusted pompano. Eh. Oversalted for my tastes, which overpowered the aioli and sauce.-Sonoma county duck-foie gras (three ways). This was probably our favorite out of the dishes. I wish the foie gras was cut in thicker chunks for the proper texture.-colorado rack of lamb. The lamb was prepared well, but the yellow bell pepper sauce and curried eggplant did not work together at all for me.-Braised kobe-style beef (Three ways): I don think any of the three preparations worked well. -Dessert sampler. There are some good ones on the plate like the pumpkin cheesecake or the ice creams. Throughout the meal, the service was very professional and consistent. Runners would serve from the left and clear from the right; not a big deal, but it shows that the front of house is well trained. We never felt hurried even though we were one of the last ones to leave the restaurant. ---------------------Only went there for dessert and ate in the bar area. The vibe was very energetic and upscale. Not a bad place to relax after a hard days work. We got the dessert trio platter, and was blown away by the different preparations.', Let's talk -I have to agree wholeheartedly with Justin G. MM seems to over emphasize the trio concept. Here's what I'd like: if you're going to try to trio, make it worth my time. I got the special which was the black bass. The bass itself was all cooked the same way with different accessories. The desserts were interesting and exemplary of what a trio menu should look like. I.E. - if it's a trio of chocolate, there are 3 totally different chocolate dishes. A trio menu would be best offered simply. The choices should be: Fish, Chicken, Beef, Lamb, and Vegetarian. Then, the dish should present 3 completely different offerings of that category: a salmon carpaccio with beets, a miso glazed sea bass, and a grilled halibut. The point is that I'd like to feel like I'm sharing with myself and my 2 imaginary friends, not like I'm breaking my fish into 3 pieces and putting different sauce on each piece.I'm giving MM 3 stars, which I feel, in part, is generous. I think that we are all cautious to give a low rating to such a talked about establishment. The food and service were no doubt good, but the reputation MM has gained is both a blessing and a curse. When I sat down to dinner, my expectations were far above that of my average mindset. I wanted to be wowed, surprised by creativity. I asked my waitress if there was a dish on the menu about which she ever dreamt, she told me the black bass... I feel like she's that girl who thinks her sex life has been wonderful, but one day, that girl gets a vibrator for a gag gift and finds out what a real orgasm feels like --- I need to take her to food that makes her shake.Overall --- the food was good, the atmosphere was a little pretentious and a bit minimalistic for my tastes, and the service was good. Would I go back? Not when Canteen, Fleur De Lys, and Town Hall are so close, better, and cost less., 'When you want to-celebrate a special occasion-impress out of town visitors/clients-get a lobster pot pie fix (Swanson has yet to offer it in their collection)-eat at a restaurant where the Celeb Chef actually works on a nightly basisNot when-you only have an hour to eat-times are tough ($$$$)MM is located in a space that you either love it or hate it. One cannot argue that it does feel grand. The food of course was amazing, amazingly rich that is. Although his specialty now is the Trios we could not resist ordering his classics from the Aqua days. As always it was divine - except the Langoustines ala tempura which had a mushy texture (perhaps frozen for too long). Service was professional and friendly but not WOW. The place does get a bit noisy so not on the romantic side. If you have not been here yet it is definitely worth a visit.', If you're looking to splurge on dinner, Michael Mina is definitely worth experiencing at least once. The food is exquisite...the surroundings expansive but elegant, and the wine list extensive. However, the service is just nice, not impeccable....which at a price point on par with French Laundry, it needs to be in order to garner the full 5 star rating. Otherwise, a lovely dining experience close to home., I went here for the first (and now only) time not too long after it opened. I can't remember a thing except that our waiter (and every other staff person) went MIA once the entree plates were cleared. Getting coffee and dessert here was a chore and I had to go to the maitre d's stand to get my bill. Never again., 'We celebrated our anniversary here and ordered one of their fixed menus. Beautiful displays of food but the food was not the best I have had in SF. The staff was not as attentive as I had expected for a place like this and good gawd the BILL .$$$$.. haha!!Perhaps things have changed because we did go to Mina in their first year of opening ... it will take some convincing for my honey to go back. With him, First Impressions are Lasting Impressions.', Sure it's expensive but ohhh man was it worth it...Being something of a recovering food snob I have to admit I had high expectations. Well, I have to admit they were all met and/or exceeded. I can honestly say that I had no qualms parting with the cash to cover the check, I left happily full (unlike some high line restaurants, they actually feed you here - I actually didn't finish everything but it all tasted fantastic) and semi-hammered (as an added bonus the wine list was excellent) - what more can you ask for?, 'definitely one of san francisco best restaurants. now about their prices...we each had the 3 course menu, which included a trio of sashimi, a trio of kobe beef ribeye, and a trio of chocolate based desserts. my wife had a trio of scallops, a trio of halibut, and a trio of shortcake with berries.with so many preparations,i was worried each course would be unfocused and would distract from the flavor of the main fish/meat. but i was wrong -- the flavor of the fish and meat came through loud and clear, with the accents pushing the dish from good to vibrantly awesome. how that for an adjective? the kobe beef was the highlight of my meal: rich and marbled and matched with shortribs which brought out another sort of flavor.the decor was a bit funky and muted, and it is a bit odd to find yourself in a hotel lobby. my view out the window was a green awning that read, best breakfast deal in town, which reminded me how pricey the $300+ dinner for 2 was. but for a special occasion and to see chef mina at his best, it definitely worth it.', Interesting restaurant based on a fixed menu, where you order the dish a main ingredient as an entree e.g. beef, chicken, etc and it's prepared in three different ways. The food is rich, but good. It's pricey, but you pay for what you get. There were four people at our table and the waiters will synchonize and time how the plates were bought to our table. well...that's where the expensive part comes in. You pay for this interesting service routine., 'Bring several credit cards, you may need to max a couple out to pay for your dinner! However...it is worth it. The wait staff needs to be watched real closly to appreciate the full attention of detail the put into serving you. The food is excellent, although at these prices, you want to make sure you eat every last bite, and that caused my girl friend to have to go to the bathroom to make room for more! The courses come out prepared three different ways each, yet all compliment each other. Think about that! They serve you about 9 different dishes, yet they all work together so well. If you are on an expense account, go here often! If you are wanting to mark a special occation, this is the place, it is very memorable!', 'I was visiting San Francisco for the weekend and heard great things about this restaurant. We made a reservation for Saturday at 9:45 pm, but they said to show up early because they would most likely have tables free up earlier.9:25 pm: Arrive at Michael Mina. It looks very grand from the lobby of the Westin; we were impressed. The hostess notes that we were early for our reservation and states that they did not have any tables open. We say that wel take a walk around and come back in 15 minutes.9:45 pm: Arrive back, hostess says that theye just setting our table. We were happy to just wait for the table, but she INSISTS that we sit at the bar. Didn know why at the time....10:00 pm: Still sitting at the bar. No one has told us what happened to our table. Talk to the hostess again, she says that a number of parties are paying their cheques right now. She appologizes saying that they should have left a half-hour ago. I not impressed -- what happened to our table they were preparing.10:15 pm: Still sitting at the bar. Still no table. Still hungry.We left, disappointed and unfed. It bad enough they didn have a table for us, but even worse that they lied about the status.Maybe the food or experience is great once youe seated, but they didn give us that opportunity.', my last two dining experiences there were not that satisfactory. the food was still tasty but it didn't taste nearly as good as the first time. im downgrading this restaurant to a 4 star.rant - for one of our dinners, there was a shoot going on. it was very annoying to be eating dinner w/ a bothersome light /camera shining in your face. i wouldnt have been as ticked off if the staff had acknowledged the inconvenience the shoot had thrust upon its patrons. at least try to move me to another table or something. the ambience (not that there is one in the lobby of the st francis hotel) was just ruined. i noticed some other couples (who were in the direction of the lighting) dining who were also justly annoyed. rave - my friends really enjoy fine dining so we all decided to go after i kept raving about MM. we were very lucky to have MM come over to our table, shake our hands, and take a picture w/ us. he seemed very gracious and down to earth.___________________________4.5 starsthe food is delicious. the service is impeccable. i had tears of joys and then those tears turned into tears of sorrow when i saw the cc bill. it ended being $300+ for 2 ppl.we had the 8 course tasting menu. i would recommend getting the 3 course prefix menu instead. 8 courses is just waaaaaaaaay too much food b/c the chef ends up sending you 2 complimentary dishes in addition to that. i would go back again soon if it didnt break the bank., I like how he presents his courses in trios. Everything was spectacular, and I especially enjoyed the hand-signed card from Michael congratulating my gf and I's anniversary. Next time back, I would like to try the lobster pot pie. I recently learned that he also has 3 restaurants in Las Vegas (MM Bellagio, Nob Hill and Seablue). This leads me to believe that he is more of a businessman than a passionate chef...more of a brand than a man...more Wolfgang Puck/Emeril than Ron Siegel. -1 for that., 'Came here for a special occassion. They started us off with an amuse bouche of a lobster trio - lobster/hamachi tartare, lobster salad and a lobster corn dog. Good - but not wow! We chose the 3-course option, which is plenty since the portions are decent and some of the trios end up being six preparations. Between the both of us, we had...Scallop trio - Seared scallops were prepared with three sauces accompanied with scallop ceviche with 3 sauces. - recommendedPoached Maine lobster with a coconut reduction - recommendedKobe beef trio - 3 slices with different sauces and 3 served braised - very tasty and nicely marbled beef though personally, some pieces were a bit over salted for me and while I LOVED one preparation of the braised zabaton that melted in my mouth, the other two were too sweet for my taste. Lobster pot pie - fun presentation where they recreate the shape of the lobster at your table. - recommended ($30 supplement). This is one of his signature dishes from his days at Aqua, I believe. Cheese course - very good except for the huge glob of em, I don know , but it tasted like rose flavored molasses. Just a note, unlike Gary Danko, they don have a cheese cart where you choose your options. But I liked the three they put together. Chocolate trio - yummy and totally indulgent - 3 chocolate cake preparations with 3 mousse/shake preparations.The service was good - our server was very pleasant and sweet but I think the service at Gary Danko is much smoother and polished.', Two huge things crushed the restaurants ability to meet the expectations set by the website. #1 It was loud as all hell. I mean, it was hard to hear my date and the waiter. The noise from the hotel lobby bounced into the dinning room and combined with the dining room noise to create a huge headache. I had to repeat myself and ask the waiter to come closer in order to effectively communicate. Furthermore, I was closer to the table next to me than I was to my date, accentuating the noise issue. Forget that nice romantic dinner I was intending.#2 While the service isn't bad in terms of attentiveness, the servers took away from the delights of dinning at such a resourceful restaurant. When we asked about the wines, the guy suggested 3 different bottles with little explanation. We asked for pairings, he pointed to 1 for each course. They have 2200 wines on the list! I wanted to hear the nuances of maybe 2 that matched my tastes. But he didn't even ask what I usually like. He ended up choosing and I had no clue what I was drinking. (one of them I liked, the other was pretty bad and way too bold for the fish) The waiter also wasn't accommodating. He couldn't offer any useful insight on the menu. When I reminded him of my lactose intolerance he told me to avoid the sauce and ice cream in the dish or suffer. (ha!) He also brought out the wrong wines for us and gave us glasses instead of tastings. They courses were brought out with out a pause between dishes - the (food) tasting was actually placed on the table before we even ordered! Often, the wine came out after the course. . As for the food, it was good but I didn't write about it until now for a reason. Do you really want to pay $88/$135 for a meal where the food is an after thought to the experience?, While it's appaling that they did not try to incorporate the beautiful Beaux Arts interior of the St. Francis Hotel, what they serve at this restaurant is fantastic. Each course is rendered in threes, which allows you to have 3 different styles of cooking for the same type of food., We give this 4.5 stars, because although the food was spectacular, the bill was horrificly expensive.. Michael Mina did not fail to disappoint in creativity and flair in his food.. And the service was impeccable...D & I went for our joint birthday this year and we did the 6 course Seasonal Tasting Menu with the Wine Pairings.. I had told the restaurant that it was our birthdays when we made the reservation and let me tell you, not only did they have thoughtful handwritten birthday cards for each of us signed by Michael Mina (I'm sure he just signed them, but hey, it was the thought that counts), but they also gave us extra courses as well as extra glasses of wine & champagne, and at the end of the nite, they had written personalized Happy Birthdays in chocolate on our Dessert Dishes.. It was truly a memorable experience! As was the bill at the end of the nite! Fortunately, with all of the wine and extra champagne, we were inebriated enough to numb the shock of receiving that bill...If we had to do it again, we would have only gone for the Three-course tasting Menu, because although the food was great, we were stuffed by Course 3, not to mention whatwith the wine pairings and extra champage, I was pretty smashed by the end of the nite..I am sure Bacchus looked down at us and laughed his ass off..., Oh. My. God. The food was SO good. I should mention that we didn't dine in the restaurant - we had drinks at the bar and ordered a few appetizers followed by a dessert sampler, the chocolate cake trio. Everything was amazing - can't wait to come back for dinner some day (though we had a perfectly nice time hanging out at the bar)., 'I should write an essay on My trip to Michael Mina.. well well it was supposed to be a great evening.. I was taking him for a big surprise.. pressure was on the air.. right from the time we left our house..plotting different routes to the restaurant with the taxi driver.. so that he can guess.. and top of all, all the reviews esp about late seatings.. so when I actually got there.. i was worried that it was going to be a disaster..esp when we were asked to wait in the lobby.. but fifteen minutes after.. we got a table.. two glasses of chapagne free( can really understand why we didn get in the beginning but right after when we were seated), oh well we got it.. but the best part was perhaps the host and our waiter sort of read my mind.. and understood that it was supposed to be a big night.. and it was.. perfect service.. great food.. all in trios.. and a personal visit from michael mina.. picture with him.. got sort of overwhelming.. but overall great..a bit pricey..but it is one of the top restaurants.. so for a special day.. michael mina is a way to go.'|1
34|momofuku-ko-new-york|Am I the only one who cracks up everytime I read the name of this place? I wonder if they realized that if it's pronounced as it is spelled..one may get a glass of water thrown in his face. Besides the name, this is one of the best noodle bars in the city. The menu changes often but you'll always find the best Ramen around., This was a somewhat dangerous name to bestow upon a dining spot, considering the strong possibility of its being mispronounced. (Just to clarify, it's mo-mo-foo-koo.) With a clean, sparsely-decorated space dominated by a high communal table surrounded by stools, this is a great place for a quick nosh on a cold winter day if you're into oversized, steaming bowls of ramen with generous pieces of pork, scallions, snow peas, and bamboo shoots topped by a poached egg. There are vegetarian options as well on a menu that includes other Asian specialties like kimchee - very much an acquired taste - balls of pan-fried dough, and shitake-stuffed buns., Went here and had the Momofuku Ramen. THUMBS DOWN! NBF(Not a Big Fan) and it feels like you're in IKEA. Poor chichi version of ramen with a poached egg and Berkshire pork? Now, I like a nice poached egg like the rest of you but not in my ramen. Sorry but ramen should not be turned into goo which is exactly what this addition does to your bowl. People are all Impressed by the poached egg...don't fall victim. The Berkshire Pork would be another nice addition...to a 3 egg breakfast maybe... but in this case, only overpowers their broth which is weak and near flavorless to begin with. Ramen stock should be a bit salty and rich. I looked over the counter and saw their stock BOILING!!! wrong, wrong, wrong. Shame on them. To further the Goo Factor...The noodles are horrendous...they talk a big game about how fresh they are but then your bowl arrives and the noodles are so gelatinous and pasty that you feel like they've been siting in water all night ...yuck!!! -2 stars for the ramen +4 stars because their fatty Pork Buns are incredible..if you decide to jump on the band wagon then make sure to get an order of these. This tallies MomoFrouFrou out at a +2 Star rating. Do yourself a favor and head around the corner to Rai Rai Ken for the real deal...or up to Sapporo on 49th St. (Times Sqaure) for a great & huge bowl as well as an odd Japanese Diner kinda feel., saltyyyyyy!!..,!@#%!@%...SALTYYY,, WATER I NEED WATER! and a Napkin to wipe the sweat! Don't sit across from the cooks, unless your wearing a thin layer because it gets pretty warm, and is it me or is the broth very salty, the Berkshire pork wasn't all that great,,, kinda chewy,, I absolutely love this place. It's my number one noodle bar in NYC. The place is always packed, but usually the wait is no more than 20 minutes. When you sit across from the chefs, you get a great view of your food being made, but you come home smelling like YOU were in the ramen as well. Oh well, small price to pay for some delicious dining. Try the steamed pork buns as an appetizer. They are super tasty. Everything tastes fresh and wonderful. I love the all blond wood decor, and I don't mind the narrow walk ways. Oh and did I mention the prices are great?, 'I love Momofuku! I hate when people knock it for not being authentic when it obviously not supposed to be so! Japanese and Korean influenced dishes like ramen and chap chae with a proper nod towards the traditional style, but not an attempt to re-create authenticity. Seasonal, very American ingredients (Greenmarket vegetables; Iowa Berkshire pork) are juxtaposed well with classic Asian ones. Pork-heavy in the best possible way. Great list of sake and the whole line of Hitachino Ales from Japan. Must-haves include: Momofuku Ramen, pickle plate, Ssam, steamed buns', 'Momofuku is an amazing real ramen shop with a truly fabulous chef. If it is your first time you have no excuse not to have the Momofuku Ramen. It is one of the best bowls of noodle soup you will ever have. The flavorless broth and run of the mill ingredients you get in noodle soups at places like China One have nothing on this fragrant bowl of sumptuous broth, perfectly aldente ramen noodles, succulent Berkshire pork, a poached egg and all the other fixins that make a real bowl of ramen. This is ramen deluxe and tastes great and is amazingly satisfying on a cold winter night!The other items on the menu are usually excellent and if you have room always try one of the specials the chef is actually very inventive and more often than not puts together a few nibblers to go with your ramen that are better than anything you would expect.', 'Okay, so the portions are a bit much (read: enormous), but other than that, this place was a hit for me. The steamed pork buns, with their thick pieces of spicy-sweet meat topped with fresh pickles, were amazing (and I love an authentic steamed pork bun, which this was not). The Momofuku Ramen was salty and rich and made a nice breakfast the next day (I was inspired by the poached egg in it). My friend got the Roasted Rice Cakes, which were actually rice...sticks? But they were grilled and rich in a killer spicy chili sauce, and really good. My suggestion would be to split them as an appetizer, since the portion was huge, and the dish got to be a little dull (too much of a good thing) before my friend managed to finish it.', This place is always packed and I sometimes wonder why we try to squeeze myself in there for ramen... something I can get at so many other places (usually at about half the price). But after my first few bites of whatever I order, I remember why I come here so frequently. Not only is it a hop, skip, and a jump away from where I live, but this is special stuff... from the pork buns with the ubiquitous Berkshire pork (this ingredient is all over their menu) stuffed with cucumbers in the fluffy buns to the flavorful, spicy yet sweet kimchi stew (my two favorite dishes), Momofuku serves up memorable dishes that are sophisticated yet simple. I also love the roasted rice cakes (great consistency) and their signature Momofuku Ramen (noodles taste home-made and the broth is so soothing). It's also fun to sit at the counter (you have no other choice), order Japanese beer, and watch the kitchen action (which sometimes includes some yelling and verbal abuse to the worker bees) and all the people waiting to get seated drooling over the dishes being served. My prediction is that this place could easily become a franchise... let's hope it doesn't but given the positive reviews from critics, the ever increasing popularity amongst all age groups and ethnicities, and the Korean entrepreneurial mind running this place, I wouldn't be surprised., Been there once. Ran into it accidentally after I spent 10 minutes looking for Mee Noodle Shop and then realized it wasn't there anymore.Amazing noodles, but very, very narrow and crowded. I would eat here all the time, but there's always a massive wait.Update 2/24/07: The ramen really isn't as good as it used to be. The bowls seem to be smaller, and the food isn't quite as tasty. Oh well. Rai Rai Ken it is.., OK, I give in! The noodles (Momofuku ramen) rock. I had washed my hands of this place way back in the early days, when momo had been around for maybe 3 months. the kimchee stew i'd had then was blah. but after seeing the NYTimes waxed poetic for 3 weeks in a row over the chef and his food -- and after reading in particular about his love of all things pork -- along with getting harangued right and left from everyone and their mother that the place puts out killer food, I went again. so, ok: you're all right! it was so worth the visit -- despite the gangsta/thug rap blaring over and around us. hopefully, that BIG detail was just an aberration ..., 'Momofuku means lucky peach. The interior is not much to look at - unless you like looking at the chef and his minions doing their thing, and then, well, there a lot to see. Enter through the plate glass door, turn sideways, place your back and palms to the wall, suck your gut in, and slide along behind the other diners seated at the blond wood counter facing the open kitchen. There not much room between stools, but that allows you to get a closer look at what your co-diners are eating, and perhaps ask them about it. The menu changes with the season, but the Momofuku ramen, made with Berkshire pork, is always present. And fabulous. The broth is rich and salty, the egg poached to perfection, the peas superbly sweet, the noodles soft but not mushy, and the pork so fatty and delicious you should probably have a cardiologist standing by...you know, just in case. Theye also added a fish section to the menu, so any non-pork enthusiasts now have a larger selection. By all means, try the pork buns, or the fried dumplings (again, with fresh chopped pork and scallions), or, on the tarter side, the pickled vegetables - you can easily ask your server for them because the space dictates that hel be about two inches from your face when he comes around. David Chang, the chef and owner who trained at the French Culinary Institute and worked at Craft, wasn there on my most recent visit, but the other chef was, and the diner next to me from Chapel Hill greeted him in a novel way: Chapel Hill Guy: Sara says hello. Chef: What? CHG: Sara says hi. C: Who? CHG: Your wife C: And...who are you? Drink selections are sake, Hitachino beer, and (Diet) Coke. Otherwise it water for you, served cold and frequently by the waiter, who got a good eye for a depleted glass. Contrary to some, I don think the prices are steep - if you object to spending $13 for a main course then pass on by and keep walking - there a McDonald on 14th, just up the way. Theye got a dollar menu.', I've only been here once and didn't have the noodles, but everything I tried was superb, in particular the steamed pork buns, which resemble chinese mantou but are folded over instead of sealed up. They are sweet and delicious. I'd also highly recommend the chicken wings - spicy, but in a completely different league than your typical buffalo wings. I also tried the oysters, served raw with kimchee on top. These were the smaller kind - I forget their origin - and were absolutely perfect. I could easily eat a dozen or two by myself. The razor clams were quite good, served with sausage in a delicious sauce. I wish I could be more precise about all of the flavors but it's been a few weeks since I've been there and I didn't take notes. The only drawback is it's a bit pricey, especially the beer, which I believe is all Japanese. A 22 ounce beer is $13. Next time I'll try the noodles and the sake., An authentic ramen noodle house? NOPE. Don't come here if you're expecting that or you'll be greatly disappointed.A good East Asian fusion bar with a huge emphasis on the quality of ingredients? HELLLLLLLLLLL YEAH.The first time I tried Momofuku Noodle Bar when it first opened, I was far from impressed. I'm a tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen fanatic, and the starchy, gummy homemade noodles and wan broth just didn't do it for me. However, on subsequent trips I found that they improved their signature dish so I let go of my uptight ramen expectations: the noodles were al dente but still too starchy for my taste; the broth both porky and clear (kind of a wannabe shiio mixed with tonkotsu); and the toppings of thick slices of Berkshire pork, a gently coddled egg, sliced scallions, bean sprouts, and seaweed are a soothing mix, especially after popping the egg and mixing it into the broth. (I feel the need to write the chef to tell him to name it something else since it isn't real ramen; it only creates stupid expectations.)The main draw for me actually isn't the noodles. The seasonal menu always reflects the best produce and organic meat from small farms. All the vegetables I've tried over the course of over a year have been home runs: baby brussel sprouts roasted with pancetta and doused with kimchi puree, broiled asparagus (so that the tips have a crisp bite, but the rest of the stem is juicy) with miso butter and a coddled egg on top, braised bok choy with sweetened chili fish broth and fried shallots...and the list goes on. Another favorite is their roasted rice cakes, the chef's take on traditional duk bok gi. The cylindrical rice cakes are roasted so that the outside crisps up (the insides are still soft) before sauteeing with roasted onions and a spicy and sweet chili sauce with pork fat. I also absolutely heart the Berkshire pork steamed buns. A juicy chunk of Berkshire pork with thin slices of cucumber doused with Hoisin sauce, then wedged in a perfectly steamed Chinese bun; so simple, and so damn good. Other recommendations are the cured hamachi, crispy pig tails, roasted corn, and oxtail soup. The dumplings are pretty good, too.Unfortunately, there are a few mediocre dishes to avoid on the menu. The oysters with kimchi puree and the peashoots with rice cakes are too bland, the aged Benton country ham is sickeningly salty (which is too bad because the masa cakes served with it are really good), and the softshell crabs are too chewy.There's only bar seating available with about 20 seats total, so expect to wait to eat (no reservations). The kitchen takes up a third of this tiny restaurant so most seats offer a great view of the chefs slaving away, but be warned that it gets hotter the closer you sit to the kitchen. Also note that it's definitely on the pricey side for what it is..., We have to be honest: the ramen craze isn't for everyone. To enjoy a meal here, you have to first get over the huge markup. But for what it is--tasty add-ons, buns steamed to perfection, bar seating and spotlights--Momofuku does well. And lumped together with the other trendy east village ramen joints, they deserve a spot in the upper percentile., Oh yes, this is totally delicious. I am pretty much writing about my favorite places lately. But these noodles will knock you on yo' ass. They are that good. The shitake buns are also amazing, I have to get them everytime.The noodle bar is great cause you can watch the adept chefs create their perfect meals right in front of you. It does get crowded quickly and stays busy just about every night. Snuggle up to a spot on a late Tuesday night and you can't lose., The riot of flavors leaping across your tongue will make you hope dinner never ends. And if you happen to bring a woman here on a first date, it's a guaranteed smash hit., This is definitely not authentic ramen, but the ramen is still worth trying out. It gets cramped inside since everyone is seated side by side each other; therefore, there's no privacy at all, but the food is great and the staff is friendly. I don't like eating pork with a lot of fat but I was loving the slices in my bowl. My one complaint is that the broth for the ramen was a bit salty - maybe it was a bad batch? For that I can't give this place five stars. JONASAPPROVED!, 'Very hip, very diverse and interesting menu. I was surprised by how excellent the service was. The pork buns were absolute heavenly, and their seafood looked resplendent!', Are you more excited by the thought of getting fancy ramen than actually tasting good ramen? this is the place for you. and if you like bland, you'll love this place. (or bacon, everything has bacon in it).Did i love the pork buns? yes. Was everything else about the experience terrible? absolutely.let's start with the staff. perhaps it was an off-night and they were understaffed. but we waited for almost an hour at a restaurant where you sit at a bar when there were clearly plenty of seats available. they could not manage their turnover. and my drink didn't come (had to ask for it twice - then finally got it from another server).but i will forgive bad service for great noodles. except, by the end of the night i was not in a forgiving mood. first of all, it's expensive. $9 for two pork buns? a bit outrageous. they were very tasty, and the only thing i would come back for (if i could get them to go). but $9 for pork belly and a slice of cucumber on a steamed bun is silly. they obviously know it's the only reason people come to this place.then the shrimp with corn - far too much bacon. overpowered the whole dish. not to mention made it too salty when combined with the miso broth. great concept, poor execution.and the true let-down of the night... the ramen. totally and completely BLAND. the noodles were of poor quality and OVERCOOKED. overcooked noodles at a noodle bar! obscene! then the broth was bland. bland bland bland. even the pork in the ramen was bland (unlike the pork in the pork buns). how does a self-proclaimed noodle bar serve such an absolutely horrible bowl of noodles? at least freeze-dried ramen has taste!in short, i will never return. nor will my dinner companion who has been there several times before and had a bad experience the last two times. this place gets two stars only because the pork buns were good. otherwise it would be 1., This is a cool place for food that looks very appetizing, some of which is actually very good, but only above average ramen. We had the corn and shrimp, and that was excellent. Then, we had the ramen, and it was only okay. The ramen at Menchanko-Tei is way tastier. We sat by the kitchen, and we drooled at all the food being prepared. They make all of the food look really appetizing. This would be a fun place to come at night (if it weren't for the huge waits) and settle into some cool, innovative dishes and drink some of the impressive sake on their sake list., This is a life lesson masquerading as a review. Bear with me, it's important.Even after hefty hype and even heftier wait (lines can be 45minutes out the door), Momofuku manages to be both delicious and delightful. The small dishes are fresh, original and tasty with their perfectly balanced ingredients with shout-outs to the BokChoy Ricecake Bacon, the Spice Grill Corn and yes, the Pork Buns. The ramen is yummy and filling, though the broth can be a tad salt or a tad bland depending on the batch. And the wood versus white ceramic decor is as hip as they come.The drawback? As with many other wowee-cute dining establishments, it is both elbow-to-elbow crowded and pricey. Sitting is greatly coveted so expect to wait, and be prepared to shift down the row now and then to help seat larger parties. The packed space can fun and cozy, but please be nice to neighbors and waitstaff, lest fellow diners project hate in your direction and make fun of your looks because you are being a stuck-up turnip., Don't read the reviews from people that didn't give the Momo five stars. Those nice people are nuts.I've had the real thing in Japan and this place rocks the ramen just as well as the best places in Kyoto. It's awesome. Have the pork buns as a warm up. They come with a steamed bun (kind of hum-bao-ish) and have shredded pork and cucumber inside with a delicious sauce. They're perfect to share before getting your big bowl of ramen. My fav is the pork neck ramen. That's right people - pork neck. Eat it. Because it's super tender delicious shredded pork in savory broth with other yummy items., Yum. Yum, yum, and more yum. Follow the recommendations of Yelpers who enjoyed their food, and you probably won't go wrong. We were told to order the chicken steamed buns, the chicken/egg rice thing and the momofuku ramen. All were AMAZING. The steamed buns came with pieces of chicken that were somehow both suckling and tender, yet crispy. The thin slices of cucumber balanced the salty hoisin sauce spread on the bun. The chicken/egg rice dish was a deceivingly large amount of food. The chicken was similar to that on the steamed buns and the perfectly cooked egg mixes with everything else to create a pretty damn good bowl of food. The momofuku ramen was the winner of them all. Perfect ramen noodles, well seasoned broth, pork cooked two ways, scallions, seaweed and lots of fresh peas, yum. The tender shredded pork was just as good as the other style in the bowl. The noodles were cooked just right and the broth was good just to drink from the spoon. There was no wait for lunch, but the place was pretty full - the people there eat pretty quick and leave. The service was just enough, took our order, brought us water, then our food, then the bill - I don't really require much more. The place is so small, you could really flag someone down at any time if you really needed to. Good place to eat solo, or with a friend, not a big group. Would go back many times in the future., 'middle of the road, good but not great noodles. Pork buns are good (just be ready for some yummy pork fat). Ramen is good, salty (but isn it always). However the joint as a whole lacked that OMG, this is soooo good feeling that would drive me back before trying other noodle places in the city.', 'All I have to say is try the steamed pork buns. The buns are a little piece of heaven. They are like little clouds, so light and fluffy. While your at it try the mussels, they are packed with great flavors and are sure to please. The ramen at momo fuku is good because they give you all of these great mix-ins including a perfectly poached egg. It is tiny and can have a long wait so call ahead or come prepared to wait a while.', I found the broth to my noodle soup to be very salty and overpowering. I love korean food, so I expected something very different - more authentic somehow? Instead, I found the noodles to be gluey and the broth too strong. Also, the seating in this tiny restaurant is so uncomfortable and crowded. I felt like I was practically sitting in my neighgbor's lap! I definitely think this was an interesting experience, but if you are looking for a cheaper, tastier version of korean noodle soup, go to K-town!, Whenever I crave something hot and filling, I head here. True the wait is a bit ridiculous and I could touch my neighbor by nodding my head but what do you expect? It's a noodle bar! I'm don't come here looking for a pre fixed menu or 5 feet between me and the other diner. The ambiance is what makes this place unique.Plates to try: kimchee stew, chicken ramen, buns (pork is good but fatty! so I get the chicken which has the right crunch to it) Still very good even though it's not with the Berkshire pork.There's something about seeing my food prepared before my eyes that keeps luring me back.., Now that the crowd resulting from the New York magazine review has died down a little, Momufuku's resumed its place as one of my favorite New York restaurants. I started coming for the ramen, but lately I've been much more tempted by the ever-changing list of appetizers and entrees. This is the ONLY place I'll eat pork buns (which I always find too heavy elsewhere); the pan-roasted mussels rank among the best I've had anywhere; and the spicy rice cakes are great comfort food., Re: The ramen ... The noodle had just the right kind of pull and bounce. And, oh, the pork! Tender strands, wholly saturated with broth. But the broth was just eh-okay. It may have been that we were sampling their late-evening stock; the soup was a bit salty, bitter, and unbalanced in flavor. And the 4x4 sheet of nori seemed like an odd afterthought (maybe to authenticate the Japanese-ness of the dish?). I chewed at it suspiciously.Pork buns were fantastic. Juicy meat on a perfectly steamed bun. Meat seems to be Momofuku's forte, if nothing else. I might consider a return visit if I could beat the queue.food: 3value: 3 (compared to other ramen houses)service: 3ambience: 4craveability: 3, It's been a little while since I went here so I don't remember all the details of my meal here, but I do remember enjoying it. Other than tasting some of my brother's soup (which I vaguely remember), I did not really try the ramen so I cannot really say whether it lives up to expectations or not (although one thing is for sure, it's not authentic because it's not meant to be, so judging it within that context is useless). All the food that I do vividly remember was pretty impressive, though not impressive enough to cause a hard-on of the same concrete firmness that it seems to cause in countless others (which is quite unfortunate, as I would have gladly made it my favorite new dinner date destination). The first dish that I remember was an appetizer special that consisted of cured hamachi, lemon confit and strawberries. It was delicious but I remember feeling that it was overpriced for the portion (I mean, it's hamachi, not toro for god's sake). Sharing this was quite a tease. My main entree was sauteed baby octopuses, although I forget what other elements there were to the dish, if any. They were pretty tasty, though I wish there were more.The dish that really hit the nail on the head was an appetizer of veal sweetbreads that were dredged in wondra flour and deep fried until crispy and then served with some sort of Asian inspired dipping sauce. I could of ate these for days. They were like a version of chicken nuggets (obviously not made of chicken, although the meat is white and tender) made just for offal loving foodies. They should start selling these everywhere, as simple as they are to make and with a neutral flavor that would match up with a wide variety of dipping sauces other than the one offered here. Even if it is the thymus gland of a young cow, you'd have to be insane not to like these. I'm sure even a small child would have no problem devouring them.One of the inconsistencies I find in reviews for this place is that some people (usually foodies that are big on fine dining) consider this place a great bargain because of the quality of ingredients and the fact that much of them are seasonal and/or local, while other people (usually the cheap eats crowd) tend to consider this place overpriced, often comparing the dishes to their conventional Asian counterparts regardless of any differences in ingredients, creativity, or presentation. Personally, I think most of the prices are pretty reasonable with a few exceptions (such as the hamachi special I mentioned above). David Chang (the owner) came up in places like Craft which focus on the quality of the ingredients, and any time you hear about him or anything he has to say, you can tell that this is important to him... so you have to take into consideration that this is just as much of a reason for the success of this place as the innovation (both in terms of food and restaurant format) is. Many cuts of pork go for less than 2 bucks a pound in Asian markets and such. Berkshire pork doesn't., 'Menu changes seasonally. Heritage pork lives here full-time. Pork buns, razor clams, and soft-shell crabs absolutely kill. Prepare to wait. It seats about 25 and it can be a chilly wait in the winter. Only $10-15 corkage if you want to bring your own wine.', 'We were quoted a 45 minute to an hour wait but we ended up getting a table in 20. No complaints. Sure, the ramen isn the most authentic but I think that it still pretty good. I also got the opportunity to try the beef brisket noodle soup dish and it was also very tasty. I liked the ramen noodles better than the thinner (somen?) noodles in my beef brisket soup. The ramen noodles had more or a bite and they held up better (the thinner noodles got a little limp and soggy after a while). On the other hand, I thought that the beef brisket soup was much more flavorful. Go figure. I was thinking that next time Il ask for the beef brisket soup w/ the ramen noodles but it says no substitions on the menu. I had the chicken buns instead of pork which I would normally order but since I was sharing the pork ramen I thought it might be overkill. I say that the buns were my favorite part of the meal. The bread was steamed to perfection and the meat was really juicy and flavorful. I also liked the addition of thin cucumbers in the bun-wich. They have Hitachino bottled beers which is a plus but the downside is that theye 9 bucks a pop (but then again they have a cute little owl cartoon on their label so how can you resist?) I don recommend going here in a group. Parties of 4 or more had to wait at least on hour (although it was a Saturday night). I think it best to go with just one other person.', A friend of mine visiting from LA introduced me to Momofuku in the Fall after reading about it in the NY Metro Cheap Eats issue. I guess it was early on, since there was no line to get in. The bar style seating was not was I was expecting, nor something I generally prefer. However, the Ramen was unbelievable. I had spent a few months in South East Asia last year, and had noodles for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and after a night out binge drinking. This was just as authentic as any I had ever eaten. The kicker? All the ingredients are FRESH. None of the grease that I had grown accustomed to in the truly authentic Asian noodles, and hey, they can keep it. Yes, it is pricey, but the portions are huge! I have been back several times, always for lunch and always when they open, so I haven't had to wait. Not sure if I would give it 5 stars if I went later in the day and had to wait outside in the cold, but until then, I will keep bringing my favorite people to my favorite noodle spot for lunch. Also, I try to limit my carb intake, but hell, I make an exception for Momofuku., the ramen was great...but you gotta try the STEAMED BERKSHIRE PORK BUNS!! bits of delicious pork in a warm soft bun....oh my god...*drool*very small, tight restaurant that's always crowded...but it was nice to be able to hang my belongings under the tableupdate 4/25/07: ok i actually just went again today for lunch, and, again, the berkshire pork buns were AMAZING!! but i must admit my momofuku ramen was not quite as tasty as i remembered....downgrade to 3.75 stars now, One thing to be aware of if you have the luxury of picking your seats (which you probably won't, ever) is that on a cold winter night, for some reason, there's a weird draft that comes in when you're sitting facing the wall at the north end of the restaurant (to the right when you come in). I know this makes me sound like an old lady, but when you're slurping hot broth and it's getting flash frozen in front of you, you'll wish you'd listened...The food is great, definitely not traditional. The Berkshire pork was shredded, and very fatty (yum) and I swear they snuck collard greens into the soup as well. I also split a plate of chicken wings which were deelicious.Purists might have a problem with some dish interpretations, but if you're hungry and want a good bowl of something to fix you (pre) or patch you up (post) then you've got it here. 45 min wait at 8pm on Saturday., Everything is delicious but my favorite part (besides the pork buns) is how much integrity the place has. And by integrity I don't mean that the dishes cling to tradition; if you want traditional ramen, you can go elsewhere. What I mean is that the food, the ambiance, and the music are all the product of someone's uncompromising vision and they all work together to create a singular, and delicious, experience., The pork bun is delicious; you hardly notice the fat because it just melts in with the meat. The pork in the momofuku ramen is equally delicious. I enjoyed the addition of the poached egg; I don't mix and stir my ramen as if I were eating bi bim bap so I had no problems with the egg. The broth is salty and rich with pork fat and on top of that the ramen itself is distinctly salty. However for me the combination of the saltiness and the very rich broth was too overwhelming. I was only perhaps 10% into it when I felt that taking another bite might cause me to vomit right then and there.I do really like the place; it is darkly lit, cozy and clean, and I do like eating while facing a wall. Sometimes you have to get the staff's attention but the ones on duty when I went were friendly and reliable. If I were in the mood for ramen I probably wouldn't come here; though I would come back for their non-ramen items.4 (pork buns) - 2 (ramen) + 0.5 (ambiance) = 2.5 stars, 'This was a tough one to write - Momofuku sidles up to the edge of greatness, but being best-buddies with greatness isn enough to qualify.First off, the actual noodle bar - it literally a noodle bar, the kind you don generally see in NYC. You sit at a plain wooden (plywoodesque) bar and you face the mini-kitchen and you can actually watch them make the food in front of you. That part I really enjoyed, I love watching people cook. (I also like to cook, and love to eat, etc. etc. etc.) The thing is, though, the decor seems to be from the I ran out of money before I was done school of interior design. It looks like a bunch of college students were putting together their first restaurant after having worked with Habitat for Humanity over the summer. (The fact that almost the entire crowd eating there looked like they were NYU students didn help.) But whatever, decor minor, and the enjoyment of watching them cook made up for the look and cramped quarters.Now, the food... the food is overpriced, and in the case of the duck leg ramen, a little underflavored. The steamed pork buns were served peking duck-style, with a chunk of pork, cucumbers, some hoisin sauce, etc. folded into steamed bread (a bun). It was fantastic, really simple and delicious and with good quality ingredients, the pork especially. The problem? You get 2 for nine bucks, which you can compare to Chinatown, where you can get 6 for 2 bucks. These are better... but 4.50 vs. 35 cents? That a hard sell.The ramen was mediocre, unfortunately. The duck leg was pleasant, but not roasted quite enough, the skin wasn crisp and still pretty fatty. I know there only so much you can do under short notice, but a little more time on a little higher heat and it may have solved that problem. (Then again, once you dump it into a bowl of ramen youl lose most of the crispness anyways.) The broth was ok, not great, the greens were an interesting addition but again, nothing special, and I wasn a big fan of the thicker-style noodles they use. Overall, I did enjoy it, and it was a large portion, but frankly for $16 or whatever it was, I was hoping to be a little more blown away (like at all). At half the price for the dishes, I be there all the time (the buns alone would be worth it!). At this price, it a fun excursion on occasion but you can do better for your money.(My friends had the Chicken and Egg and the Momofuku Ramen; both were decent but coulde been better and overpriced, to quote them Zagat-style.)Overall it was a disappointment, mainly because of all of the hype. It was not *bad*, mind you, it just had the potential to be phenomenal and simply fell short. I giving it a very hesitant 4 stars, since Ie only been there once and the place was packed and it possible the ramen was just a little off that night. They tried to do something great, and they deserve some credit for effort. Still - and this may be the most damning part of this review - I not sure that I ever go back unless I was really craving those pork buns. The rest just wasn enough to make me want to go back.', 'They should call it mmmmmmomofuku.Please just try the pork buns or the duck buns.Try the brussel sprouts.Try the pork neck ramen.Note the human sized pots filled with delicious broth which will end up in your ramen.It is places like Momofuku that make you glad that you are alive.', 'This restaurant is fucking awesome. I had the chicken bun and pork ramen....OMG was it delicious. It gets only four stars though due to the lack of space.', five stars. purely for momofuku's berkshire pork buns. OMG. they are eyes-rolls-back-in-your-head AWESOME. i am not exaggerating when i say that i can eat these everyday. the most tender piece of meat, stuffed in a delicate asian steamed bun, with some crispy slices of cucumber. holy cow. or holy pig!overall, my momofuku experience was fun. yes, it's a tiny space. yes, the service is mediocre. and yes, it is a LOOOONG wait. but the long wait is definitely made better if you sit in the coffee shop/wine-bar next door---have a drink there and the momofuku hostess will come in and look for you. promise. and honestly, the wait is really truly worth it. the noodles here are disgustingly tasty-- i think they put crack in it. crack, or MSG. who knows? and if you're a pork lover, this is heaven. also try their fried rice cake with chili sauce., Holy Crap! This place was amazing! After a great Lily Allen performance we were looking for a place to eat. Passed Momofuku Noodle Bar and then it hit me, this is the place that i have always read about, and my wife said that there is always a long line of people trying to get it. it was about 11pm, and we just walked in and got a seat! we first started out with the chicken buns....damn, they were awesome! my wife had a fish dish that was great, but a little spicy for her. I would have eaten her whole dish, but i was really in the mood for noodles and ordered the Momofuku noodles and couldn't stop eating them. It was perfect, especially since it was soooo cold outside. I also ordered a red rice beer...another home run. the only downside was we were sitting near the entrance and that section has people sitting on either side, so when other people came in, they sat right across from us and the table is really narrow. but they were nice people, but slurping noodles can get a little splashy.overall....one of the best dining out experiences i have ever had!, 'First time I ate here, I thought i had died and gone to ramen heaven. I tried the basic ramen with Berkshire pork, which was the most delicious ramen pork ever to tango with my taste buds. The steamed pork bun was happiness in my mouth - I a sucker for hoisin slathered pork. Ever since that night, I been trying to make my way back, but the long wait has always deterred me. Last night, we finally scored some seats. It helps that we got there at about 6:30.This time, I tried the Berkshire pork combo, which was both the shredded pork and the fatty slices, and came with a poached egg. Even though I know I read poached, I was still thinking hard boiled so that when it came, I was surprised. Poked the yolk and mixed it up, which made the broth quite thick and muddled. Surprised to see the collard greens floating in my bowl too (didn remember that from last time...or was this is a new addition?). To be honest, I was quite disappointed with the result. The broth had thickened too much from the egg and saltiness of both porks. I like to be able to alternate sips of broth with slurps of noodles, but the broth just wasn doing it for me. The noodles were a bit on the flacid side too, not springy and firm how they should be. Overall, the pork (however delicious) overpowered the dish and I just couldn finish it. I only ate about half and had the rest packed to go. I was really let down, especially since I was sooooo hungry when we walked in.The waitstaff was obviously rushing us to get out since a crowd was already forming outside, and I was more than happy to go. The pork bun was still amazing and I probably go back just for that, and maybe to try some of the other dishes. But if Ie got a hankering for ramen noodles, Il go elsewhere.', Overrated and overpriced, but still not a bad place. While my first experience there left me not wanting to come back (the berkshire pork was waaay to salty), subsequent visits have changed my mind. Some of the things on the menu are really good - the buns (chicken or pork), the crispy bacony brussel sprouts - and some a questionable, like the shrimp with poached eggs on cornmeal garnished with scallions. The eggs, though poached, were so runny that the texture was just a little gross if you thought about it too much. The shrimp, while flavorful, were a little overpowered by the cornmeal. I ended up concluding that I didn't mind it so much, but my dining companion was not a fan. Noodles: while the soupy Momofuku Ramen noodles were delicious with the pork belly and the Berkshire pork and the poached eggs, they were particularly exceptional. Plus, since I couldn't finish it that night, I brought half home to eat the next day. When I pulled it out of the fridge the next morning all the fat from the broth had risen to the top, forming a thick white layer of solidified fat about half an inch thick - good thing i didn't know how much fat was it in when I ate it the night before, otherwise I may not have been so inclined to have it. Nonetheless, if you don't really care abou the fat, the noodles are really not bad. Not my first choice of a place to go (especially since there is usually a wait for a seat), but not a bad place to be either. If you really want noodles, go to Menkui-Tei a few blocks away or if you want to support David Chang, check out his Ssam bar instead - they have the steamed buns too!, If you are a pork lover, then this is your joint.I traveled across New York City on Halloween night to try a pork bun at this place, and let me tell you it was worth the trip. The fact that it was a wind storm outside and we couldn't find a cab for an hour after we left still didn't upset me because of the tasty pork ramen I had just ingested. I am a huge sucker for salty noodle bowls, so this is like I died and went to heaven. (However, the noodle bowls are HUGE. Combined with pork bun, this is an extremely heaty meal. and SALTY! beware.)It is a very small place though with bar seating only, so I would highly recommend going very early or late, and no reservations. So prepare to wait., I love this place! The baby octopus salad is very good here, but the wait sucks! The Momofuku is wickedly delicious although a bit pricey at $14 dollars a bowl. Don't go with a big group because you might not be able to sit together and the seats are counter-styled so they're not conducive to chatting or sharing. Slurp it down and get out -- fantastic!!!, 'I so puzzled by this place. I am happy it does well... you know you gotta support your peeps, but Ie been 3 times and each time, I completely underwhelmed. First off the space is cramped and I get it. I know this was the first restaurant for chef David Chang and if I were starting out, I take a smaller place and try to get the most bang for the square footage. Still not exceedingly comfortable. Secondly, the flavors are off. My favorite item Ie eaten here has to be the delicious mushroom buns. But the noodles.. the raison dtre of this place have been a let down. The broth in my chicken ramen was sooo incredibly salty. The noodles I had previously were at the other end of the spectrum and incredibly bland. Hmmm...Finally, the place is very anti-veggie friendly. I read an article that said David got irritated by all the people asking for veggie options and decided to cut them out entirely and add more meat to all the other dishes. Nice! So in this vein, the menu explicitly states that no subs will be made and that there is only one veggie dish available. I don eat meat, but I okay with broth and with eating around the meat... but really it be easier if they could just leave it out entirely. Last time I asked for that, they got all huffy and had to ask the chef. Really?? That sort of arrogance is really uncalled for.I think the flavors must be hit or miss. My neighbors said that they enjoyed their noodles. My buns were good (ha, that sounds funny).. but Ie yet to try something else that justifies the prices and attitude.', I think this place deserves all the hype that it's received.Yes, you will wait. Yes, it might be a long wait. Yes, it might be cold outside while you wait and shiver your tootsies off. But cot damn, them's some good ramen noodles! My fave is the classic Momofuku Ramen with its panoply of vegetables and Berkshire pork.. I've heard complaints that the broth is too salty but I find it oh so tasty and delicious. Some companions have found difficulty finishing the gigantor bowl of noodles that the kitchen dishes up, but I've never had a problem.Of course I could go on and on about the steamed pork buns, but we've been down that road, and they are fantastic, we all know this, and it's true, they are better here than they are over at Ssam Bar. What I will recommend is the seasonal pickles plate to start off your meal. Salty, fatty, tasty. I love this place. Show up early and bring a friend (but not too many, it's pretty cramped)., The best neighborhood noodle shop. If I work from home, I make it a point to get the pork ramen. It is a perfect dish. Lines can get super long but the wait is worth it. Try the chicken wings, you won't be sorry.Update: Have the milky, cloudly cold sake. You won't be sorry., The quality of the food matches the prices appropriately: Around $15 ramen and $9 buns are worth their flavor and portions, and my stomach has left Momofuku unsatisfied. The four stars, however, is the price you pay for the actual location: It's relatively small, the seats are cramped (which isn't altogether bad, but isn't particularly ideal) and most importantly, it takes forever to get seating at a reasonable hour. At the very least, I would recommend that one try Chang & Co.'s fairly unique flavorful setup, but I can't imagine myself waiting 30 minutes for a seat in the future (especially with an assortment of Japanese options in the area)., 'I will dream of Momofuku every day. We showed up at about 11:15 am and sat right down to the perfect lunch on a snowy day. Berkshire pork buns, which as everyone already seems to know, are IT, the Momofuku Ramen with Belly and what seemed to be confit pork and a poached egg, and the Tsukemen (cold noodles with yes...Berkshire pork, poached egg and dipping sauce. Momofuku IS definately all that, and when I go back, I am going to try everything else on the menu, and I mean everything.', Overrated! I don't understand the lines outside of this place at all! I am a noodle person. I love noodles, but the noodles at Momofuku were just nothing special, if not too salty. The amount of sauce on some of the other dishes (for example in the little bun/sandwich things) were a little overwhelming as well. I did like the spicey korean rice cakes though., I'm a big ramen girl and while Momofuku probably isn't an authentic Japanese ramen place, it's a really YUM noodle soup place with hearty portions and high quality ingredients, major props for good veggies and I love their benedict-like eggs. I slurped up the whole thing up, perfect for a bitterly cold day as was how it was when I was in the city that weekend. The place is clean though a bit small. Wait wasn't a problem since we got there a bit before opening and thus the first ones seated. If you're hungry, order the steamed buns--they come right away!, 'Great, flavorful ramen soups. Only one complaint, after trying the pork buns for the first time, I was in heaven. My mouth was salivating for the next set of buns, only to be sorely disappointed that they were not as succulent, moist as the first time. I could barely finish the second bun. But their ramens always hit the spot!', 'should be better places around NYC...overpriced... not specialized Momofuku ramen... but Kudos for nice service... 3 stars for it!', It's about time I tried Momofuku Noodle Bar! I thought the soup was a bit salty, but the ramen was really fresh. I could feel the springy-ness of the Ramen in each bite of my Tsukeramen. Fresh is something I'm really into these days, especially in light of recent events (rats @ KFC, corrupt health investigations, and the like..) I can't eat anything that doesn't sit well with my mind or my nose.This is definitely a place that deserves 3.5 stars - but unfortunately there is no half point rating system. The food was fresh even if it was too salty, but the crowded cramped dining doesn't make me want to squeeze into Momofuku any time soon.Also - I think the food is a bit expensive for what it is. Ramen, Hoisin Sauce, Pork Soup Base, some Vegetables, and a Semi Raw Egg for 17 bucks is a bit overpriced - I can do the same thing in my kitchen for 5 bucks, if that. I firmly believe that most of the food we like to eat, we can make ourselves, cheaper and better quality - it's the atmosphere, the people we are with, and not having to wash a pile of dishes after, that we really pay for.I think I'll take some dishes in my spacious kitchen and living room, relaxing in front of the TV, over cramped Momofuku the next time I decide to get Ramen., As a vegetarian, I respect Momofuku for being so forthright about their unwillingness to compromise their food by making it vegetarian --- they only have one vegetarian option, and even that doesn't have broth. But I was disappointed by their careless service. Don't believe the hype --- if you want some noodles, the admittedly less hip Rai Rai Ken down the block offers great ramen cheaper, faster, and nicer., 'really crowded and warm inside - you go there for the scene.', What's the big deal about this place??? The place is sooo small and crowded and their noodles?! Their noodles entrees are ridiculously OVERSALTED...I could hardly eat it. If you're the kind of person that enjoys eating salt straight out of the carton, then this is the place for you. Not only was my dish gross but so was my friend's ramen dish. If they could cut back on the salt by 75%, it wouldn't be that bad. I will say though..their chicken sandwich appetizer thing (I forgot what it was called) WAS really yummy but way overpriced.|2
35|moto-chicago|'This was my first time at what I like to call a sci-fi restaurant, where food quality and presentation go hand in hand. We went with the 10 course tasting menu with wine pairings and I managed to lick my plate (and glass) clean on every single course. Il have to admit that I was not blown away by the food itself, given all the hype, but it was definitely tasty, and the presentation was flawless. I was particularly impressed with the service - the staff was attentive, knowledgeable and the entire meal was so perfectly timed, which made for a wonderfuly satisfying dining experience. My friend and I were both pretty drunk by the time the bill came which made putting the credit card down a little less painful. I recommend going for the experience, but be prepared to spend.', This was easily one of the best dining experiences I've had in Chicago. The food was fantastic - and such an experience. I'll leave it at that - would hate to spoil the surprises. The restaurant itself was pretty quiet as it seemed everyone was as into the food as we were - people talked of little else. The wine pairing was really, really amazing. But yes. The price is super high. Think of it as purchasing a food adventure. Well worth it., Hate to bring this place down with reviews, but...Here's the thing. I had fun. My friends? maybe not so much.We decided to go full hog and get the 20 course GTM (grande taste moto). Our server said it would take 3-4 hours.Um, no. It took 5 hours. The servers were nice and know the menu well (they've all trained as chefs there as well) but they aren't fast to get a drink (unless you're ordering the wine pairings; half of us did).My recommendation? Go for the 10 course menu. You'll still get most of the cool dishes (we realized there were a bunch of duplicates in the menu but the descriptions made the dishes sound radically different)., I'm really into places that take risks and push the envelop and this place does it extremely well. You see things you've never heard of and it all works. Good wine list, too. It's a little pricey, but it's worth it for that occasional treat., The experience and service were amazing. We opted for the GTM and it did take 4.5 hours instead of 3. Looking back on it, GTM wasn't the ideal choice since most of the courses were dessert bites. I saw another table get the 5 course choice and their servings were comparable. If you still want the experience, opt for the middle choice.The highlights were the edible menu and anything that used a new way of delivering food in your mouth (e.g. coleslaw syringe, freeze dried stuff). Most of the dishes were good, but not outstanding. One word to sum up each dish is 'essence'. During our GTM meal, what we were getting was the essence of each dish. One bite of their frozen flap jacks and I felt like I ate a whole tower of pancakes. A pinch of cotton candy strings saved me from craving a whole bag of it. It was interesting since I felt satisfied with each bite. They should package M&Ms like this so you don't end up eating most of the bag.Four stars since the GTM was overpriced IMHO. We could've had 2-3 great tastings at Matsuhisa for the same price., Moto is hands-down the best restaurant I have ever eaten at. It's pricey ($200+ a head), but not as expensive as Alinea... and a superior experience. I've been fortunate enough to dine here, WD-50 in New York, and at Alinea.. and Moto wins-out without hesitation. The room is nice (maybe simpler than others), the service is fantastic, and the food is amazing. Maybe the science geek in me appreciates this more than others... but you walk away (3+hrs later) amazed. We ate things frozen in liquid nitrogen, printed works of art, even cooked than liquefied doughnuts... every single item was not only interesting, but delicious. THAT's where Moto differs amongst it's high-priced peers... you get the amazing impact... and in the end, you're (reasonably) full, and everything TASTED fantastic. The things they do and how good they taste stays with you... we're still talking about Moto, and it's been 8mos. You'll probably go once in your life... but if there's a place in Chicago for an amazing highly memorable dinner.. this is it., 'A biochem gastronomy experience. As a biochemistry insanity experience, this was unique and extreme, maybe even worth the price of admission. The food is also very good, but presentation and uniqueness seemed to take priority over taste and texture sometimes. We had a little trouble communicating our desires on wine selections with our server, who did not seem particularly knowledgeable for a restaurant of this caliber, but she was persistent and gracious and stuck with us until we got it all worked out. The service for us was very attentive. We got the 10 course meal and found it had enough variety to get a good taste of Moto. Our server also scored us a bonus item from the 18 course list that sounded particularly interesting. The atmosphere is a little crowded and noisy for the price. Go here for the unique science experience if you have the dough. It is truly one of a kind.', 'This place was phenomenal... I did the 5 course tasting menu and was stuffed by the end (in a good way). Every dish is unique, especially those in the earlier courses. The cucumber reduction is the perfect start to the meal (besides consuming the filo dough menu!) and sets the tone for the rest of the dining experience. We dropped some serious coinage $700 for 5 people... but it was worth it. If you love adventurous eating this is definitely a place to try...', Utterly fabulous! I went there on November 14th 2006 for dinner with the man. Experimental, yes. Interesting, yes. Well done? Definitely! I usually hesitate when it comes to the experimental, post-modern, trendy eateries here but this was a worth-while time and monetary investment.It's experimental without being over the top. And, unlike other uber trendy modern places with lackluster white walls and not much of anything else this place pulls off the minimalist decor in perfect style. It's a perfect accompaniment to their cuisine. Yes, it's minimalist complete with white walls and all but at least they add flair to it from the bamboo placemats to the touch of greens and neutrals on the walls. And let's face it, for them it just works I couldn't imagine it being done any other way.The service is unbelievable. At first it was a bit disconcerting, the staff appeared to be a bunch of 21-25 year olds, hardly what one would expect from a 5-star restaurant. After discovering they are all trained chefs or currently in training and after listening to their renditions of the individual plates, the wine lists, etc I was impressed. What a bold, daring move to hire the young ones in training to staff the restaurant. And being a resident in training myself I can really appreciate this. I think it's a great move and they seem to have a passion for what they do, combined with a desire to learn more both from their peers as well as from their customers.The food was out of this world. I took advantage of the 10 course with the wine pairing. The wine portions were very generous, perhaps even too generous for me but very good. The food was outstanding, flavorful, exciting and filled with different textures that rolled off the palate beautifully. This chef has true vision as well as the ability to produce a pleasing product for his customers. Unlike other modern mediocre high priced places Moto gives you the aesthetic while still delivering on flavor. The presentation is very pleasing and dramatic as well. I will go back there again and again and again..., 'Just like with Alinea, you must view the pictures simultaneously with the review to better understand. I won write a bunch of comments about each, but rather primarily rank the dishes and mention the highlights for each dish. I prioritized the dished by a 1 (dishes I loved), 2 (dishes I thought were good) ,or 3 (dishes that I didn care for). I had 7 #1s, 8 #2s, and 7 #3s.#15 Tortilla chip menuIt obviously cool that he can print menus that are edible. But one side of the menus was not even legible and the flavors were that of grocery store chips. The sauce lacked depth as well. #16 Salmon & sesameThe idea is great on this one. Using liquid nitrogen to freeze the sesame oil with a salmon tartare. But there was no liquid in the dish to help bring the oil out of it frozen state so it tasted pasty.#13 Soup & saladAnother cool concept, pairing soup in salad in one bowl, both in liquid form. The soup was pizza, a good quality spicy tomato bisque. The salad not as good. Liquefied ettuce anchovy paste, and croutons. I liked the paste. #10 Acorn with baconA very interesting dish. On the right was a normal acorn squash soup, but the left was where the dish was at. If I remember correctly, a dehydrated squash and hydrated. It had a funky texture, but I liked this one.#19 Synthetic champagneA syringe releases two ingredients, both of which I can remember and 3 secret ingredients. I think the effort that went into this dish didn show in the final product. Nothing special from a taste standpoint.#21 Goat cheese snowSnow? How about shredded goat cheese that was chilled.#2 Hamachi & orangeI loved this one. The yellowtail was good, but the thing is you squeeze some of the orange on it. The orange is carbonated, so it like if Orange Cola had a baby. not sure how this is done, but it a very cool effect.#3 Miso & grilled tunaOne of my favorites for the effects. The miso soup was good. The tuna sat on a grill frozen with liquid nitrogen, so it actually gave the raw tuna rillmarks or freezer burn for that matter. I thought the effect was really cool.#18 Pomegranate & caped gooseberry Nothing special here. I think they call it a palette cleanser or palette yawner. Just pomegranate soup, gooseberry sorbet, and a gooseberry.#6 Caramel appleAnother good one for me. A hollowed apple filled with bacon and given the usual caramel apple fixings. The sweetness of both complimented each other.#4 Rabbit & aromatic utensils The battleship plate. The sage utensils didn do much for me, but they looked cool. The roasted rabbit and the rabbit confit were delicious and tender. The beans and the rice krispie things were not needed.#14 Jalapeno & cilantroI love creative ice cream, so I like this and the avocado and cream went well with the dish. No need for the grains on the bottom.#9 Al pastor with avocadoDuck al pastor, very good dish, avocado popper, spooned with a good mole sauce on the bottom. One of my favs that night.# 20 Orange scented wine glassYou take a tour of the kitchen for this dish. A laser gives the flavor of orange into a wine glass. The wine glass is set on your table and served with wine after a few minutes. I tasted wine, not much orange.#22 Chicken-fried mac-n-cheeseRib-eye fried like chicken with white truffles and mac cheese. By far, the worst dish of the night. Rib-eye did not work fried and the dish was so salty.#1 Lychee rigatoni fruit plateLoved this dish. Flourless, eggless, lychee rigatoni on a marscapone sauce that was was great.#7 Carrot cake planetCarrot cake in three forms, all of which were new to me, hard to describe. I liked this one a lot and it just looked cool#17 3 cotton candy stagesTop --- tasted like shredded filo dough with simple syrup. Bottom --- cotton candy edible paper --- cool, except for the copyright. Bottom --- hard candy --- it tasted ok. Nothing special.#12 Flapjacks prepared tablesideThe pancakes are prepared on a small grill that was frozen in liquid hydrogen and dipped in syrup. I liked the flavor of this one and it was creative. A keeper.#8 Cherry bombThis was cool. A cherry sauce cover chocolate with a cherry stem (play on words), macerated cherries (boring), and cherry cola candy (cool).#5 Doughnut soup & pancakeI could drink this everyday. Jack-in-the-box should come out with a doughnut shake. Very cool.#11 Chili-cheese nachosI loved when this one came out. It looked great yet it was a dessert. As for the taste, as Borat would say,  Not so much. Sugared chips, kiwis, shredded mango sorbet, lemon marscarpone cream (loved it), and ground milk chocolate.The chef still need to refine his cooking processes and the same ingredients/techniques were presented in too many dishes. But, I think I still need to give it a 5 star as he is doing something that only a handful of chefs are doing or even capable of doing in the US.', 'On December 10th, at 9:10pm, Matt Skonicki and I walked into Moto.Moto is in the meat packing district of Chicago, and is located at 924 Fulton Market.Moto is small.After having our coats checked we were ushered into the dining room. Feeling much like a gay couple, we were seated at a small table. The water was served from individual stoppered glass bottles. The menus were brought. There was a pleasent din in the restraunt at this time.Matt and I pretty much knew we were going to have what is known as the GTM, or Grand Tour Moto. An 18 course, $165 dollar meal. The menu is edible. We ate the with much intrigue. We ordered a bottle of white wine for the meal, a hasty little 2005 vintage that was quite good. Then the courses started.-DUE TO A 5000 WORD LIMIT, I HAVE OMITTED THE COURSE BY COURSE REVIEW. PM ME FOR IT-The meal was $500 all together.There was no one left in the restraunt when Matt and I left at 1:30am.My final score: 4 stars out of 5.The sense of taste, like all other senses, needs to rest sometimes. Moto hammered it out over all 18 courses with intense flavors. One or two courses with a more smooth and light flavor would have been great, and added just that last half a star.Moto also serves 5 and 10 course meals. I suggest to any to try this place, it an adventure in fine dining.My final thought:There something to be said about a restaurant where every bite puts a smile on your face.Matt Quote of the Night: I hope the last course is a big fucking piece of chocolate cake.', Wow. I visited Moto twice when it opened and was impressed by the creativity of what they were doing, but the food didn't taste that good. Well, I went again last night and it great. They are showing more restraint on the science food thang, even a dish or two out of ten with very little science going on. Where they did add technique, it was to enhance the food. Truly one the best meals I've ever enjoyed. I would go back here before Alinea or Trotters., By far, Moto is the fanciest restaurant I have ever been to. We had the GTM course on the menu. It was the most expensive course on the menu; but we figured we will probably not go back for a long time ... so why not splurge? To be honest, I don't remember much of what I ate. Two dishes stood out ... a sushi roll wrapped in a custom printed rice paper and tuna cooked in some kind of NASA technology box. The service was exceptional to say the least. When I got up to use the washroom, a server was immediately by my side to escort me and to hold the washroom door open. It was a great experience, but something that I will probably not do again., Moto's the kind of place you just need to go to experience it...traders love to take dates here to impress them, and other traders so if you meet one, hint at it ;)Big price tag, so clearly a date place haha...the guy who took me here is so unexperimental w/food, totally steak & potatoes, but he knows how into food I am. He had quite the time dealing with things like baby quail, jalepeno ice cream, an edible menu and every other course. I loved it though and clearly thats all that matters. The presentation was incredible. I should have brought a camera. I would recommend this place to experimental food people...who don't mind the price tag, and want something funky and different. Its definitely not for everyone, but I had a great time., My first venture into so-called molecular gastronomy. Went with the $70 five course menu. Personalized, edible tortilla menu was a nice touch. Goosefish entree tasted over-salted. Liquid donut and other 'forms' for dessert did surprisingly taste like Krispy Kreme. Server seemed unprepared to describe each appropriately.Overall, five course menu lacked a lot of the special preparations and gimmicks. Very creative in theory, but food was not all that tasty in the end. Was not wowed by the experience as a whole. Maybe had too high of expectations to begin with. GTM is probably the way to go to get the full Moto experience, but just couldn't rationalize the price., I've been dying to try Moto since it opened in all its slick glory several years ago. We finally went for my birthday and it did not disappoint. We opted for the twenty course GTM and accompanying wine flight.My favorites:Beet cakeGin & Tonic fizzLangostine in brothJalapeno gelatoFruit & PastaFlapjakes prepared tablesideCarrot Cake planetDoughnut soupChili-cheese nachosMy least favorite was probably the miso & grilled tuna, but even that was alright.The service was flawless. The entire staff is dressed in black suits, and everyone trades off with busing, serving, and explaining the courses. The GTM includes a brief kitchen tour, which was eh...I could have skipped that. Also, we felt that the GTM was just a few courses too many. 15-17 would have been plenty, whereas 20 was just painful. All in all, though, it was a great evening!, After literally eating our menus at Moto (parmesan flat bread), we weren't sure exactly what we were getting into with the ten course-tasting menu and a kitchen that uses lasers and liquid nitrogen in their cooking. The First course had us eating something similar to dry ice and we all looked like dragons breathing steam. The dinner continued with more ultra contrived dishes---deconstructed macaroni and cheese, a conceptual pulled pork sandwich with an edible briquette (a freeze dried substance dyed with squid ink), dessert nachos (candied tortilla chips, shredded mango, chocolate that looked like ground beef). The dishes were starting to feel more gimmicky rather than innovative.We weren't sure if it was standard practice at Moto, but servers tended to raise their voices a few octaves higher when describing the molecular gastronomy inspired courses. The circus like experience of Moto was heightened on our kitchen tour where we had to wear goggles to protect our eyes from... lasers? The red disco light in the kitchen? We weren't sure and at this point and the meal was becoming laughable, which at such high prices, isn't a good thing., I took my sister here for her 21st birthday. All in all, a very nice experience, though I was surprised by the location and decor (I'm from out of town).We had the 5 course menu, but they added in a couple of extra courses cause it was her birthday. This was perfect. My sister's vegetarian and I cut out everything but seafood, so we definitely had a different version -- it's really nice that they do this.The first course was a soup, half pizza and half caesar salad. Honestly, not my favorite. The pizza part tasted like spiced tomato soup. Other than that everything was nice -- notable dishes were the gin fizz, the cherry bomb (my favorite), the donut trio (oh my god the donut soup tastes like a krispy kreme) and the flapjacks (the syrup was delicious. I wanted to drink it).The location is sort of dead though, and when we got there it was just us and a family of 4. odd. it's so sweet that they printed up a menu with a birthday wish for my sister though. i've had better in spain (Commerc 24) but it was nice., Freaking amazing. Delectable food, amazing science -- and a sense of childlike wonder, which is a rare experience in these jaded adult days :) The chef filps and reverses textures -- a pool of fine cheese, crunchy macaroni, fizzy reconstituted melon. Coconut powder. An anti grill, powered by liquid nitrogen, in which liquid cooked pancake is squirted on and turned solid and served on a spoon with maple syrup.10-courses, just like French Laundry, but with more food per course. We left full and delighted.Something that hasn't yet really hit SF dining scene. It's located in Fulton Market area, which reminds me of the Meatpacking District in NYC. Trendy bars and restaurants next door to design shops and food wholesalers. Service was impeccable yet friendly. With their headsets they talked to the kitchen and timed your courses if you left the table for a moment., Moto is totally awesome, creative and fun! The atmosphere is very sleek, warm and toned down because they want the dishes to be the main attraction (and they truely are). The chef is like a culinary mad scientist. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who considers themselves a bit adventurous when it comes to food. It is quite an experience. It is expensive but well worth it. They just opened up a sister restaurant right next door called Otom. I haven't been there yet, but it is suppose to be somewhat creative but more affordable. I will review that once I go., 'Moto, along with Alinea and Avenues, represent the holy triumvirate of young American molecular gastronomists, which all happen to be centered in Chicago. My wife and I went to Moto a while back with some co-workers who are also foodies. We all agreed that this was one of the better overall meals wee had in Chicago. We got the 10 course menu. There were some lower points (not low points, mind you, but not as high points), including a sweet and sour soup and the edible menu. Most dishes were excellent, including an incredible duck dish. Very highly recommended.', 'Moto is a experience you will remember. The concept is extremely different; food that you will never have anywhere else. It is the marriage of science and food (quoted out of Zagat). You must be prepared to order the 18 course tasting menu in order to completely appreciate the style of foods the chef presents. I can not describe the food as must go to Moto to experience it. It is not for meat and potatoes person and you must be prepared to take a adventure in eating. They have no competition in Chicago and maybe in most of the USA. The three times I have gone I can tell you at least thirty percent of the guest are in the hospitailty/restaurant industry. The decor is very minimal and the staff all wear suits. Every staff person is cross trained in the dining room and in the kitchen. If you have seen the movie Gattaca (Uma Thurman & Ethan Hawke); then you might get a slight feel of the atmosphere and staff of Moto. I highly recommend you go with a group of friends and only with people who don take life to seriously. Valet parking and on street parking is available. Keep in mind I give Moto a Five Star rating for Originality of the Concept of Food, Atmosphere and Quality of Service.', I hate to go against the grain here because I truly wanted to LOVE Moto. It appeared to have all the right components to be my new favorite overly indulgent culinary muse.... *minimalist decor in trendy meatpacking district *attentive service from a knowledgeable, well trained staff *FABULOUS wine menu *inventive cuisine and innovative preparation methods *etc, etc, etc.Unfortunately the food just wasn't that good. I'm not sure if people get blinders on when they are shelling out big bucks at the latest and greatest and presume that $$$ = it must be great. Everything that came to the table was OK. And the 'Beet Cake' (a frozen beet sorbet with micro greens, goat cheese reduction, basil oil and beet sauce) was almost totally unpalatable for me... and I like beets!!!! Not one dish was ooooohed or aaaahhhhed over because of its fabulous tastes and complexities - is that really the sign of a 5 star restaurant?? Smoke and mirrors presentation is certainly entertaining, the liquid nitrogen (albeit a bit overplayed) cooking style is definitely impressive and a visual treat, but again... it doesn't make anything taste better.When the tastiest item on the menu is the menu itself (baked on parmesan flatbread), I have to say Moto fell short. Memorable experience. Disappointing food., 'The service was impeccible and the atmosphere was very modern and sophisticated. The menu is served on a plate which after you read- you can eat! We had the 5 course and everything was good, except while I thought the ceasar salad soup was okay, I didn care for the pizza soup. The eggs and hash course was served on a battleship type game board- and the fourth course is a strawberry sorbet served with shortbread and fruit- except it is all constructed as to look like a Chicago hotdog. Quite clever!The flavors fell short for me, there was a fish course with beans that was delicious, but the rest of it was just okay. I am not dying to go back, but I definitely glad I went. I hate to give this place only 3 stars because the service was absolutely perfect- but the food just wasn that amazing.', My boyfriend and I braved through the rain and tornado warnings so we can check out Moto and we were not dissappointed. This was our first taste of of molecular gastronomy. We both ordered the 5 course tasting menu. The highlights included the crispy hash browns and beef; de-constructed steak and eggs; biscotti and coffee; coconut and rum. Each dish came to life by the the unique plating--for instance the steak and eggs were placed in this metal half box with the basil on the ends of the fork and knife. The biscotti was in dry ice so when you dipped it in coffee it disintegrated. Also, we had our first edible menu-- made out of cracker with my name at the bottom. By the way, you can bring your own wine, corkage is $25. Service was amazing--the staff was knowledgeable and they were attentive. I've been to many fine dining establishment and Moto has my vote for the best service.Dining at Moto was an amazing experience., 'My wife took me here for my birthday. Embarrassingly, I had to bail at course 18 of 20. I had made fun of her for only eating half of the already small portions, but the combination of super processed/reduced food + wine pairing managed to fill me up faster than a thanksgiving turkey.The food certainly was inventive and fun and I glad we tried it. But in the end, it was all over the map, i.e. 3 kinds of cotton candy, mini pancakes (that tasted like still-frozen waffles), Greek salad (shot of clear liquid)... I still would rather go for a multi-course dinner with a theme (regional and/or seasonal) vs. this Coney Island meets Star Trek meal.', 'A fantastic experience (keyword: experience) but not a super gastronomic delight.Pros: Excellent service with eloquent servers, an unforgettable culinary futuristic experienceCons: Price but that expectedOn my first real visit to Chicago, my friend took me to Moto. We first walked into Otom (the sister restaurant next door) thinking that the futuristic restaurant spelled its name backwards to deter unsophisticated patrons. Unfortunately, we were wrong and the hostess kindly directed us next door.I wonder if the confusion is intentionally part of the experience that we were to enter an unknown.Regardless, my friend and I both had the 10 course tasting menu. I have admit that my palate probably isn as refined as most people and I was recovering from a cold. It took some adjustment to grasp the complexities of flavor and felt that the menu should have increased in the wild...a sort of reaching the climax.Nonetheless, I was able to taste the complexities of flavor. Although liquid nitrogen was used liberally through nearly all plates. I appreciated the thought put toward the deconstructed sushi (which was surprising in taste at first, but really was a different way of eating sushi), cold beets (normally i don like beets, but i liked in this form) and the mac and cheese (liquid nitrogen cheese melting with burnt? macroni). But the first greek salad was surprisingly disappointing. The second greek salad in a shot glass was the complex dish I had that night. Taking a shot, I felt a slight extreme bitterness of a greek salad then at the back of my throat a few seconds later, I felt a tang. Then the aftertaste lasted for several seconds more. In some way, I almost felt like I went to Charlie Chocolate Factory and had eaten something...but didn really consume it.I love sweet dishes and here at Moto, it was probably no exception. I loved the cotton candies. The fizzy watermelon. It was interesting how the way they placed the plate determined the way we choose to ate it. At other tables, we noticed people got a smaller plate for the same amount of fizzy watermelon and didn eat the fruit at the same time as the rice cracker.Another thought-provoking dish was the chili cheese nachoes and the chicago hot dog which looked (somewhat) like the real thing, but were simply desserts.Unfortunately, the one dish that really satisfied me was the pork shoulder. It was sweet and meaty. In some way, that was the only dish that didn contain much molecular gastronomy and yet I have never tasted a pork shoulder that good. It was simple.I liked eating the paper that said patent pending.What added to the experience was how the servers seemed to appear from the dark. The curtains to the kitchen were black and moving through the curtains, you couldn see anything behind it. The kitchen was right next door to the restrooms...and from where I was standing outside the restroom door (apparently people at moto take forever in the restroom), I could hear a lot going on inside the kitchen. If I could only open that door...Valet is nice because they actually ask for your ticket as you pay for your dinner bill so that you have your car waiting by the time you get outside.', Moto is one restaurant in the Chicago dining scene, correction: global dining scene, that is so unique you'll remember it and talk it about it for years to come.As with every other find-dining establishment, the service is outstanding, attentive but not intrusive, and the presentation is sophisticated. I think the food is kind of hit or near-miss depending on your palate. We ordered the 5-course menu with wine pairings (the 10 and GTM menus were just too much food for the evening). While the ceasar salad / pizza soup tasted much like a salad or pizza, the liquid texture did not appeal to me. It made me think about the kind of food astronauts must have to eat when they are zero gravity. For me, this was a near-miss.But highlights of the evening included:1. Tuna sashimi prepared in liquid nitrogen with a spoon shaped biscuit. This bonus course was so tasty. The contrasting textures of the lightly chilled tuna melting in your mouth against the crumbly bits of biscuit just worked.2. Steak and eggs deconstructed. Fascinating presentation on metal plates with aromatic fork and knife. Tasted great.3. For the sweet tooth in you, the biscotti and coffee and coconut and rum desserts were terrific.The wine pairings were fabulous. The flavors in each course are deconstructed and reconstructed in such inventive ways that I strongly recommend adding on the wine pairings if you can - the wines complement the flavors of the dishes exceptionally well., 'Exquisite dinner and service that can be summed up in 2 words:Small Chubby', 'Moto is one-of-a-kind. It really more about the overall dining experience and the folks at Moto definitely gave us that.A friend and I went with the 10-course menu (the Grand Tour Moto seemed like way too much, it a 3 1/2 hour committment!) and we were pretty much dazzled from the beginning. I loved that what was listed on our menu (which was edible) was only slightly indicative of what the actual dish turned out to be. Our menu consisted of:-Greek Salad (an octopus leg and freeze-dried kalamata olive chips)-Greek Salad again (a cold clear soup infused with cucumber, lettuce, vinegar and tomato)-Caribbean Escolar (broiled fish with spiced pineapples on a frozen mini-rack)-BBQ pork and beans (braised pork shoulder and beans pureed and shaped into noodles)-Quail Pasta (quail with dehydrated elbow mac in truffle cream)-Steak and potatoes (24-day aged filet with crispy hash)-Fruit and Bubbles (carbonated grape with walnut dust and freeze-dried chips)-Truffle and White Chocolate (a piece of edible paper infused with cotton candy and a white chocolate truffle that exploded into liquid when you put it into your mouth)-Persimmons and Cream (this was the one dish I didn like --- persimmon ice cream and fruit foam with carraway seeds)-Sores (a chocolate ganache dome filled with peanut butter marshmallow cream and a marshmallow that melted away)I walked away stuffed like a dumpling. It was all delish.The other important thing to note about Moto is the service. It is amazing.The space is tiny and the entire meal is really a choreographed dance. The wait staff maintains a close eye on how fast you eat or if you need more drinks so that they can time exactly when to bring out the next course. If you leave your seat to go to the restroom, theyl replace your old napkin with a new, bring you a new drink and make sure that everything is refreshed when you return. Super sweet and knowledgable staff --- I wouldn have known what we were eating otherwise!Yummy and great for the curious foodie. Go try it, youl have to fork over a few bills (ours ended up at $300 for 2 people) but it worth it.', 'Ie been wanting to go to Moto for forever and finally this evening I had my opportunity. John, Ashley, Audrey, and I decided to brave Moto science experiment of a menu and take on liquid nitrogen one bite at a time.An Edible Menu is delivered to your table accompanied by Smoked Salmon Caviar, Unfermented Grape Juice Jelly, and a Poached Pear with Vanilla Cream. The Edible Menu details the three tasting menus Moto offers. Seeing that it is/was a Wednesday night we decided to limp into Moto and order the five course tasting menu w/ wine pairings. I know what you are thinking.... Hike up your skirt and order the 10 or be brave and order the Grand Tasting Menu! Regretfully we didn. DO NOT PROCEED IF YOU PLAN ON GOING TO MOTO AND WANT TO BE SURPRISED!The firstish course was a Fauxjito. Moto takes a champagne flute and fills the bottom with mint syrup and then extracts lime juice from a syringe into the glass. This concoction was delicious and tastes just like a mojito (minus the alcohol). Our first course was Bacon & Maple, which consisted of a savory creme brulee paired with a bacon shortbread cookie. Incredible flavors and interesting texture! This dish was paired with a nice Chablis. The second dish was the Shutome with Fried Rice, which was centered around a seared piece of Shutome (broadbill swordfish from Hawaii). The fish was beautiful! A tofu puree, braised seaweed, and popcorn shoots completed this perfect dish. Surprisingly, this dish was paired with a Pinot Noir from the Northern Island in New Zealand. Our third dish was the Crispy Hash Browns & Beef, which was a play on steak and eggs. The dish was served on a metal Battleship-esque serving tray, with herb scented utensils. Grilled steak w/ Bacon Puree, Hash Brown w/ Tomatillo Ketchup, and an Egg...........YUM! Homaru Cantu you sank my Battleship! Wow, that Tempranillo sure is nice. Our fourth dish was a Pumpkin Tamale with Risotto and Horchata Ice Cream. You guessed it another winner. Making it even better was the 2005 Chateau Rumieu Lacoste Sauternes they paired it with. We made nice with our server and he brought us out an additional dessert course. Our fifth course was Smores. Moto Smores consist of a Chocolate Mouse filled with Liquid Graham Crackers that just Gooshed out when you broke into it with your fork (Oh yeah there was toasted marshmallow too). This dish was perfectly paired with a Zin port. The sixth and final dish was the Biscotti & Coffee. Sounds simple right? Wrong! The pastry chef freezes coffee using liquid nitrogen to create the biscotti and then takes the components of the biscotti and turns those into liquid. So you actually dip your coffee into your biscotti. Delicious! This was paired with a 1968 Madeira.To make a long story short (TOO LATE!). The food was absolutely amazing! I had extremely high expectations going in and Moto exceeded those. I was anticipating really cool food, but Homaro Cantu not only delivers the cool, but he also delivers sophisticated dynamic flavor profiles that just plain out taste great.The space is minimal and modern in design. If you like mid century, modern, smart design youl enjoy the space. The service blew me away. Totally casual, engaging, and not pretentious at all. When asked where he likes to eat our server responded with I really like Hot Dougs. What a perfect evening!4 Five Course Tasting Menus3 Wine Pairings----------------------------------$600PS... I am writing this just after I got home and may be a bit tipsy. Just a wee bit. Goodnight!', Eating at Moto is like taking a turn in a room in Willie Wonka's factory, a room in which Wonka's apprentice chef fell in love with the everlasting gob stopper and continues to fetishize it into as many varieties as possible. Once you hit your second course, I think you'll know what I'm saying: Each and every bite seems to live and evolve inside your mouth, not to mention grows in your stomach, for an almost uncomfortable, though thrilling, length of time. I could swear I only ate about nine legos worth (yes, at Moto, food is all about play, and anything, even eggs, can take the shape of your favorite childhood toys) of food, yet my brain and stomach were tricked by some gob stopper magic. Someone ought to get to the bottom of it, though I doubt it will be me (I'm generally too busy stuffing myself with bucket loads of more pedestrian fare). Let me note as an aside, but one interesting to those who like to balance their checkbooks, that I am not used to paying more than $100, and certainly not more than $300, for a meal for two. Having said that, you cannot possibly enjoy Moto thoroughly (and you must!) unless you forget about the price tag. While at some restaurants, you might have to literally hold your nose to do so, at Moto you can more easily be seduced by the incredible gadgetry of the food if nothing else. Yet I still remember how much it cost, and the ping pong game in my head goes on ... 3 or 4 stars, 3 or 4 stars, the memorable price tag being the only factor tugging me toward the 3.The ping pong game is now over, my head is fine, if wobbly, and I'm going for 4 stars because of the tremendously sweet service in such a potentially intimidatingly mod place, the exquisite presentation of the food matched with a different wine for every course, and the most appealing way I've ever seen my name in print (on an edible menu, of course).I had the smallest meal (but, I'm told, with the largest servings) with, as I mentioned, the wine pairings. Though I'd like to expand my Moto dish repertoire, I think this is a sensible way to go, at least at first, because, as I heard from those seated next to me, it's a long, long road once you start reaching course seven, eight, nine, and beyond. Even if you aren't attuned to or try to dismiss the gob stopper magic at first, it catches up with you, so eat slowwwly and enjoy, even if you can afford to eat here every week. Moto food is art, and, overall, I think would make a seriously sophisticated Willie Wonka very proud., My sister took me here for my 21st birthday and while the overall experience was fun and interesting, Moto isn't really that great of a restaurant.We were really excited by the presentation of all the different dishes, but if you're looking for actual tasty food, don't go here.I'm glad I went, and if you want to try Moto, you're probably gonna do it regardless. Just don't expect your tummy to be satisfied., Outside of Alinea, no one comes close to Moto.This is'nt just outstanding food - but electric theatre on your table. You will get poetry written on brie cheese, fish that is cooked in a brown bag in water flown in from the Pacific ocean, herb infused cutlerly that affect the taste by influencing your sense of smell, and so on and so forth. This is the Cirque de Soleil of food.Go now !, 'Moto is the intersection of food, science and modern art. We did the 5 course menu. The presentation of everything was ingenious. That the main reason to come. Heck, even the damn menu was edible. One course was served in a laptop type contraption, with aromatic silverware that sprouted coriander. I wonder if that how happy meals will be dished out in 2041. The specialty drinks are solid. The chorizo margarita was smokey, strong and garnished with a small sausage. Nothing like some meat to go along with your tequila. When you strip away that hype, the food is ok at best. I know each ingredient has a novel backstory in the way it was acquired or prepared. But the flavors didn blow me away. Found both the breakfast creme brulee and beef in the fajita x three course disappointedly bland. But portions are adequately sized, so you do leave somewhat full.Beware, they automatically include 18% gratuity. Which we conveniently saw after tipping 25% for impeccable service. Love when that happens.', 'This restaurant gets major kudos for its different ways of serving food ( menus that are baked and edible, the use of liquid nitrogen to cook food, using props like giant syringes to infuse food, etc). While the food is good, its not great. However, its certainly an experience. I had the 5 item tasting menu. That was enough for me to get a feel of what this restaurant is all about.', 'I wish I could transplant Moto to San Francisco. I love this restaurant for so many reasons. The fact that Chicagoans get how cool molecular gastronomy is makes me proud. I have never been to a more innovative and fun restaurant. Every single course will make you laugh and say WOW!! Alinea is a close second, but Moto is truly the front runner in experimental cuisine in chitown. GREAT for out of town guests. I LOVE YOU MOTO!!', 'I was very excited about coming here for a friendship celebration last night. We had a big table, and we were able to book us the night before and confirm the morning of. We all had the 10 course, ( which i would recommend over the 5 and the GTM) and I had one variation since I do not eat pork products. Everything we had was delicious, and thoughtful.I especially enjoyed the liquid salad, Quail Mac and Cheese, My substituted scallop dish, the Duck roadkill, and Grapefruit .I think that Moto caters to a crowd of people, who aren necessarily looking for new or tasty food but for people who are looking for the future food ? and even, ironic food. It is post-modern! (Ahem, Homer Simpson on the edible men card) Moto would understand terms like ROFLCOPTER and be able to serve it.For those who came and didnt enjoy, they were perhaps misled into thinking moto is ALL about the food ( although I do think the food is outstanding, there are many more elements involved)Those who had the 5 course, i don think they can fully understand what the idea behind the meal is (also 5 is probably not enough food) We had 10 and left happy and full. We also had every single one of their signature cocktails, and I will say my favorite is the lemon drop. Which had the most magical orb inside of it, it is a must try. Service was fantastic, doors to the bathroom opened magically, napkins folded and placed by what seemed like ghosts. All the servers are actually chefs, who are rotated every 6 months from the kitchen to service, so they actually know what they are talking about.Just to test them I would suggest dropping your napkins a few times and asking plenty of questions, as we did.I love that when we asked for a tour, our server said, We usually would but Chef is messing around with a LASER down there.LASERS!!& I would gleefully go back, for the GTM if i had the 5-6 hours needed.', 'Some people love it, some people hate it. I fall under the ambivalent category, because while the presentation was at times ingenious, some plates never had the ow factor. If I coughing up $250 for dinner, it better be one of the best meals of my life, coupled with an experience I will never forget. It failed the former, but certainly lived up to the latter.As everyone else noted, the menu itself was presented as edible paper, with the 10 course selection neatly printed on it. The first course involved kajiki and sesame; blue marlin with sesame poured from a nitrous pot. It was pretty neat to spoon a bit of sesame into my mouth and exhale through my nose; smoke would filter out. The greek salad and gumbo were rather forgettable dishes. BBQ pork was surprisingly good. It was tender, with a cider-based marinade. The next course was a modern take on mac ncheese, but with quail, powdered parmesan, and pasta. By this time, I was too full to finish it - but it was okay. The desserts were probably the most welcome part of the evening. Each dish was presented in unique ways, and tasted very different from one another. My favorite involved the 2 and 3 dimensional truffle - there was a surprise with the truffle ball.So the food itself involved lots of hits and misses, but the drink pairings were spot on. I had non-alcoholic beverages; I had to drive back. My favorite was the lemon drop. It involved lemonade encased in a gelatinous ball.Service was thorough, attentive, and extremely professional. With each plate, the server spoke a little about it and answered any questions I had. I never had to get his attention; he just knew when to drop in and he was never intrusive. Overall, it an interesting experience, but one I would not repeat at MOTO. Why? Because I might as well buck up for other great molecular gastronomy destinations a la El Bulli, Fat Duck, and Alinea.', 'Ah, well.We had the 10 course with wine pairings (6 wines, I believe). Got there at 5pm on a Saturday, the latest possible with two days notice. The decor was simple and clean, waitstaff friendly. Patrons were either in their 20s (probably because they also didn have the foresight to reserve a table early enough), or late 70s (probably because they like eating dinner at 5pm or earlier.) The food... was fine. I was expecting more fanciness, but a few rehydrated or liquid nitrogenized things here and there, starting with a gimmicky edible menu, combined with a slightly overcooked grouper, and finally four (4!) of the ten dishes ended up being desserts. It was disheveled. One dish, as far as presentation goes, was extraordinary: the Road Kill looked like exactly that, including rice puff maggots (questionable) and beet reduction blood-spatter. The taste? ehh. I didn hate it, but at over $500 for two people, I wouldn go back.', Moto is probably one of the best restaurants I've been to in Chicago. Chef Homaro Cantu offers dinners (and let's not forget the edible menu) that is not only delicious, but truely creative. It is an experience to dine at this place. Top to bottom - this restaurant does not miss a beat., I havent been to moto in a few years...but I still remember the experience like it was yesterday.I tell people that Moto is the Mad Hatter's Tea Party of Chicago Cuisine. And I just love it. If there is one thing i absolutely despise it is a gimmick. . Moto is a genuine experience....not some kind of shtick and that's one of the things that makes the experience so memorable.I did the 10 course. I loved how my meal was interactive...there were courses in courses (there was a picture of spicy tuna maki in a plastic bag under my charger for my 3rd course...it tasted like...well spicy tuna maki)-- and things that i had never been served before or since (carbonated grapes anyone?)I was vegetarian at the time, and was accommodated easily. My date was a meat eater and actually liked mine better! I felt kinda bad for him because after shelling out $500 on a 2nd date we were too full to make out when we got back to his house. But the experience was memorable for both of us., I was recently in Chicago for the National Restaurant show and had the chance to visit several of Chitown's amazing establishments. About 4 years ago I first heard of Chef Homaro Cantu from a very interesting article in wire magazine. After that I was fascinated with his artistry of cooking and longed to visit Moto. I finally had the chance to visit Moto this trip. On my final night in Chicago I decided to spend a solo meal with Moto. I was as giddy as a school girl. I had nothing better to do that night and opted for the Grand Tasting Menu (GTM, 20 courses) and the wine pairings (around 16) and was ready to be taken away on a journey with Chef Cantu. My First impression of the restaurant was a little off. After dining at Alinea's beautiful restaurant I thought that for a fine dining establishment that the decor and dining room was a little cramped and lame. Since I was alone I had plenty of time to meditate over the food, the wine, and the service. First off the service was less than comparable for the amount of money I was paying. 4 times my silverware was set incorrectly placing utensils in the wrong place and then the server coming back to correct himself. Next, twice they poured me incorrect wine. Also the wine service was horrible. Out of the nearly 16 wines I tasted not one of them were explained. The sommelier did pour a couple of the wines, but still did not tell why she chose to pour the wine with that course. Lastly, the food. The food was truly inventive and tasty at times, but my biggest problem was when I questioned the methods of making the food I was told they could not tell. This really bothers me. First off any one with an understanding of Molecular Gastronomy can figure these things out, but that's not the point. My point is when becoming a great chef (which chef Cantu is) half the point is spreading your knowledge and techniques to people that want to learn. I understand that there are several patent pending creations Chef works with, but knowledge is one of the best things you can give a person. If chef is worried about others taking his ideas then why cook at all? Did Auguste Escoffier horde his knowledge? No, he published Le Guide de Culinaire which is considered one of the most important cook books of our time. I am not saying to Chef to publish a cook book but be a little more open to maybe expressing his thought processes and understanding of the products he use. I also was very surprised at the lack of use of luxurious ingredients. I am not saying this makes a good meal but I also felt his products he did use were sub par I guess at the end of the day it is about making money and that's the feeling I got when I left the restaurant. By no means have I given up on Moto. I believe it is on the forefront of modern cooking and very important to the gastronomic scene. I am just hoping Chef Cantu realizes how important his cooking is and helps mold the future path of the Culinary world instead of keeping it to himself., 'We had an excellent dinner at Moto last night for my ladyfriend 30th birthday. Everything from the edible menu (with a special birthday message), to the food and wine, and the service was outstanding. I not a food expert by any means, but I loved the weirdness of it all - the battleship plates, liquid biscotti. It was a truly memorable experience. We had the 5-course, due to time constraints, but I would love to go back for the 10 or GTM. Thank you chef Cantu and all the servers!', Moto does was not the best fine dining that I've ever experienced, but it certainly was the most interesting. I took my boyfriend to Moto for his 30th birthday, and we ordered the 10 course with wine pairing. Each course was unusual and very tasty. Most notable among the dishes were the road kill (called braised duck on our menu) and the smores, which had a lovely gel-filled pastry that tasted exactly like a smore. I also really enjoyed the liquid shot that tasted exactly like a greek salad. Brilliant!I thought the food and service were superior to Everest, but Tru continues to set the standard by which fine dining should be measured, in my humble opinion. Nonetheless, Moto was a worthwhile experience., 'Oh goodness - you have to try this place! It is almost too cool for itself...think edible packaging peanuts, sesame oil powder that turns liquid when it touches your mouth, cheese broth, and smoking coffee flavored biscotti dipped in liquid nitrogen. But even better...everything tastes good too.I live in SF, but I had been dreaming of hitting up Moto for about 2 years now, after reading a profile of Homaro Cantu in a magazine. Weird science indeed. I so glad that I finally had a chance to try it a few weeks ago, when I was in Chicago for business. I had been a little apprehensive about the alleged 3 hour dining experience (we ordered the 5-course, and my friends who had previously dined at Moto advised us to beware of the long meal) - but it wasn bad at all. In fact, I venture to say that they whisked the food away from us right as we ate the last bite - almost too quickly in some instances. I did see the waitstaff peeking out from behind a door, watching everyone eat so they could time things correctly. I believe they adjust the amount of food based on the # of courses you taste - so you just get smaller portions for the 5 hour GTM. Highlights include the aforementioned things, particularly the last course of coffee and biscotti. The coffee was liquid flavored as biscotti with a touch of hazelnut, and the biscotti was the coffee flavored, liquid nitrogen dipped concoction. There was a cute little packaging peanut hanging out in the corner of the dish - of the texture you expect from a real Styrofoam packaging peanut, but made of vanilla. Super cool.Anyway, try this place. You won be disappointed. One downside - the price. Superbly pricey...but then again, not as expensive as Alinea or Trotter...', I was just browsing through the Moto website and they have many pictures of the crazy concoctions that Chef Cantu put together. Then it dawned on me: I wasn't served any of that! The presentation of the 10-course was superb but not exactly out of this world. Should I feel motivated to try the GTM (where I assume all those pics are from) or should I feel cheated? Unchanged on the stars as I ponder..., 'A friend was visiting from Boston and she had made reservations to this place so I accompanied her. We tried the 17-course GTM - what I call the gastronomical tasting menu! It was delicious and very interesting in presentation! A little on the pricey side ($175) but should be tried at least once in your life!The edible menu was printed on edible ink and paper and glued on a rice cracker. A little salty but an interesting presentation.Probably my favorite from all the courses was what they called Roadkill - I loved the presentation of the meat which represented, well you know what it represented ;) and the sauces they used: tasty yellow melon sauce spread in dashes as the road and a tasty sweet red sauce splattered on the plate!The plus of the experience is we met a lovely couple who was dining next to us and celebrating a birthday! Shouts to Rob and Rose (yes, same name as me)!', 'This place totally rocks!You really have to have an open mind when you come here because there are some really unusual things that get put on a plate for you to eat. Hubby and I usually like to Hop from place to place and do drinks and apps but decided to check this place out when they told us about their 5 course menu. I started out with a Chorizo Margarita - like in Chorizo sausage! Dude! I was either going to be totally grossed out or totally dig on it and it was the smoothest margarita I think I ever had. Hubby had some concoction with absinthe that he loved...We started out with our menus that were on some cracker thing -- it was really yummy and I actually wanted to ask for another menu to eat but thought they talk about me if I did! My favorite courses were the Faux-jitas that even had guac ice cream. Sounds icky but the whole thing definitely worked! All the presentations were amazing and the food was delicious.The servers were extremely attentive and Hubby and I will definitely be back. Wee just trying to decide to to the full monty 20 course or 10 course next time we go... It is expensive but very worth the trip if you want something yummy and unusual.', This was truly a dining experience. We thought to come here as we were in Chicago during our anniversary and were celebrating some other events as well. It was a little strange since the location seems to be near a warehouse district (I'm not from Chicago so I don't know for sure) but this industrial setting seems to fit right in with what the restaurant is trying to create. We didn't get the GTM menu because we had already done some celebrating and probably couldn't drink that much wine or even eat that much food. We ordered the ten course menu instead. Each dish was excellent, playing with textures and different ways to deliver flavors to your mouth. My only complaint is the wine service as basically each time they poured a wine for you, they showed the bottle, but then had nothing else to say. Stil, it was an altogether enjoyable evening and fun as well., 'This was the most unique and exciting dining experience of my life! My date took me there as a surprise and he got many brownie points for doing so or at least another date anyway. We did the 10 course with the wine pairing and I think that is the way to go because I was very satisfied with a nice little buzz by the end. From the Greek salad in an eye dropper (sounds weird, but really did taste like it) to the Sores dessert that was like a waterfall I was always anxious to see what came next. The wine pairings were impeccable and there was even a delicious sake mixed in the bunch. Pricey, but well worth it if you enjoy dining as opposed to eating out. Highly recommend for a special occasion.', 'I thought a haiku series would be apropos...Edible menuLike an ancient palimpsestWith truffle on sideLiquid NitrogenOn de-constructed dumplingsSmoking dragons, wee!Two large sea scallopsConnected by Tofu BridgeDelicious structureFajita x three?Each bite, a meal entirelyShocked, shockingly good!Think of menu plateStrawberry and brown butterA creamy throwbackBiscotti, coffeeGastronomic orgasm:Sex with Moto chef.', for a unique dining experience, Moto fo-sho, but for a yummy experience, Moto no-go. :)we did the 7 course with wine pairing. the culinary concoctions were interesting/unique/creative/etc but not very yum. i felt the individual ingredients' characters (taste and texture) were lost in translation.but, the service was flawless and the ambiance was perfect for a quiet evening., 'Truly an interesting experience in food- I was all set to give it 4 stars for great service and stimulating surprising food, until we got the bill. They brought us our already large bill and told us that while there was an 18% service charge added onto our bill, that was NOT the tip and did not go to the servers. We asked the server what is was for then and he just said its what the owners charge. We totally didn get this and felt that if the owners didn give the service charge to the servers that was between them and the staff. We were already paying 18% ($90) for service so what the???? We didn add much on additionally but left feeling bad that the servers might not get anything for serving us for hours. We should not have had to leave feeling bad when we dropped so much money and an 18% Service charge. What a terrible way to end our experience there! They should at least tell people about this charge up front and explain what it is. We are always happy to spend money on good food but feel this was a little sneaky and unfair to both diners and staff.With that being said, here is what we thought of the food:With our 10 course meal Moto served us a delicious octopus dish with liquified greek salad in an eye dropper, a grilled pineapple frozen with liquid nitro served with a yummy cod, quail prepared chicken wing style, A nitro watermelon course..... truly interesting and actually quite good at times. I was a little disturbed by a braised duck dish called road kill that actually looked like an animal killed on the road on your plate. It had a little brain mold made out of a mushroom gelatinous like substance, and was complete with simulated maggots, blood and mangled looking meat. It was a little too morbid for me but interesting. In the end we won go back because of the bad taste left in our mouth by the strange billing. Such a shame with such interesting food and great service.', The owner of this place is not only very cool, but also very down to earth. His wife is also, completely unexpected. Everything good has already been said about Moto. For those few that think the food is all show, may I suggest watching the food channel's show IRON CHEF. Homero Cantu handed a world renowned chef's @SS to him on a platter! (Chef Morimoto)The laser is pretty over the top, but c'mon...IT'S TOTALLY COOL TO SEE., 5 stars don't seem like enough, I dunno... it's really something that should blow you away. We got the GTM with wine, and man was it amazing. So many tastes, so many flavors... yeah it's expensive, but you know how I rationalize it? I feel like with 20 courses and 12 wines I got like 6 meals. 6 amazingly good meals. I could go on and on. It's all such a surprise. It might not be your thing, but I highly recommend trying the whole molecular gastronomy thing... this is certainly an excellent example of it., The food and presentations were incredibly unique and exciting. I liked this place, but I didn't love it. Much like Alinea, it's one of those molecular gastronomy experiences you have to have at some point, but I wasn't wowed by much of the food itself., You have to want more than just great food to go here. The molecular gastronomy experience is equivalent to a going to a show where you are constantly surprised. The wine pairing is excellent. They even threw in a wonderful beer from Quebec in addition to the first sake I ever liked. The staff was happy to see you get excited because they are not just waiters; they have input to creative process.I've been here a few times and loved it., The highlight of my weekend trip to Chicago was to be dinner at Moto. Now that my 20 course GTM has come and gone... and I've had a chance to reflect on my dinner... I've come to the conclusion that while having a food science meal is a worthwhile experience in and of itself... that doesn't always translate into excellent food. Some dishes really worked for me -- I was fascinated with the preparation, presentation, and consumption -- but the majority of the courses failed in at least one of these categories. That being said, there were only a couple of items that I really didn't care for; and while relatively expensive, the experience of eating here was unique enough for me to be satisfied overall. I don't think I'll be returning here but knowing what I know, I would still eat here once if I hadn't already., Okay, so far all my reviews on here are 5 star. Not intentional and I don't give 5 starts to everything. But I'm still new here and building my list of reviewed spots.In any event, Moto has been reviewed a ton. Yes, it was awesome. Great food and amazing experience. Here's what I am thinking about it right now... It's the only restaurant I have been to where you review the menu, order and then EAT THE MENU! Come on, that's cool! :)|1
36|naha-chicago|'This is a great little place on Clark street. Very upscale in decor and a good stop for post work cocktails. Very ecclectic mix of food is on the menu. The staff is definitely friendly and courteous and will make brilliant accommodations for a small party. The bar and selection is lovely as well.', Last night I went with my wife to a dinner and wine tasted hosted by the fabulous wine makers Domain Carneros. The vertical tasting that accompanied the meal was exceptional. The food that was served was not! Luke warm scallops whilst tasty should have been hot. The second course was better but we had to play spot the crab meat in the salad. The duck was the beacon in a dark night well presented and very tender and tasty to eat. I realise this was a private function and the restaurant we catering for 50 people at one time but I felt a restaurant of NAHA's reputation should have done a little better. The evening was very enjoyable mainly because of the wine, company and friendly attentive staff. I shall go back and try the main restaurant and hope for a 5 star review to follow., 'I heard so many good things about this place that I decided to organize my company holiday dinner here. First, I went to go check it out. . . The first time I went the seasonal soup was some type of fancy pants tomato and it was awesome (even served with a classy side of mini grilled cheese). For my main course, I had the poussin (which I learned was a mini-hen and since I did not want to keep calling it a poussin I kept calling it a mini-hen. I am sure my server was impressed with my sophistication level). Anyhoo, the mini-hen was not for me as most small game birds are not. However, the service was great and classy. We ended up going back as a company and all had a blast (and a lot of wine). The service again was great and they set us up with a semi-private room that looked over the rest of the dining room (if we wanted to open the curtain and see everyone else, it was no longer private). They were also very accommodating to the special dietary needs of our party (veagans, vegetarians, etc). I recommend Naha for a fun evening out AND for a hip twist on stuffy corporate dinners.', There's great decor at Naha, but I was disappointed with the quality (and price) of the food. My soft-shell crabs were okay, but the preparation almost hid the good crab flavor, and for $38, I should taste the crab! The cannelloni I had for an appetizer was amazing - too bad there wasn't more than ONE. Service was nearly unbearably slow, even though the restaurant was nearly empty for our 7:00 reservation. They did ask if we had theater tickets or were on a schedule when we sat down, which was very thoughtful. All in all, I'm glad I checked it out, and I might go back for the lounge (which appeared to have a much better menu), but I won't have a full meal at Naha again., I'd have to say this is a good place. The decor is very soothing and the food well done overall. Assistance with wine selection was available and on the mark., This place had very attentive service during lunch time. I think my water was refilled about 8 times during lunch. I ordered the Mezze, which was an appetizer that included hummus, babaganoush, pita bread, olives, and spiced beef. My personal favorite item was the feta cheese turnovers! It's a good variety of food, if you're looking to sample different items. I also decided to order the sorbet of the day, which was orange vodka sorbet. The vodka flavor wasn't too noticeable and it was, overall, a good choice! Oh, and I can't fail to mention that the decor in Naha is awesome! Loved the minimalist feel! ;), I had wanted to try this restaurant for a very long time. The decor is interesting but it's one of those restaurants where the price and food did not live up to the experience. The best thing we ate was the cannelloni appetizer. It was fabulous. I had halibut for dinner and it was dry and over cooked. The price of the entree was 40 dollars and I only ate about half of it. The service was also super slow. We ordered a bottle of wine and getting our glasses refilled was nearly impossible which was difficult because the bottle was being chilled away from the table. On the positives the wine menu was really unbelievable. I would suggest if you are going to try it you go to the bar and have an appetizer and some wine or make sure you have plenty of time to spend., I am only giving 3 stars because I didn't feel the menu had enough variety. That would be my biggest criticism of this restaurant. The menu was interesting and very fun to read b/c there were a lot of interesting ingredients etc.However, as a fish eating vegetarian- I felt very limited. Almost every option had ham added to it or bacon or something. I was able to have their hearts of romaine salad and modify it so that it was vegetarian. It was actually delicious. The flavors were excellent and even though it was small in size, it was very satisfying. My entree was the 1 vegetarian option. It was speghetti squash and some pumpkin stuffed into canneloni. I don't quite remember exactly what was in it but it was so delicious! I just wish it were a larger portion! The portion sizes in general are pretty small but beautifully presented. All of their dishes are also very attractive and the whole look of the restaurant is minimalistic but really well done and comfortable.The service was fine, I felt like our waiter was somewhat short with us, seemed like he was in a hurry.Their dessert menu also seemed inventive but I skipped it!I would tell my friends to visit this restaurant, it is obvious that a lot of attention goes into the menu and the food., 'Naha is one of my favorite date restaurants in the city. As a single guy, I like to take a date to a spot that is casual and sophisticated at the same time. Naha fits the bill, and then some.Ie visited four times now, and although I think the menu and food are slightly overpriced for the taste (hence the 4 stars instead of 5...) the atmosphere more than makes up for the occasional taste fluctuations. Very traditional American fare to be found here (The Fois Gras was amazing, however, I not sure they still have it on the menu.) I have also had the quail and halibut. The seafood has left something to be desired from myself as well as my guests, so I stick to the meat and potato variations that Naha has to offer.What set this place apart for me was the service that my waiter John, and shortly afterwards, the owner Michael, provided. John was incredibly informative on each of the menu items, and gave myself and my guests numerous wine couplings that blew us away. In all honesty, he probably the best waiter Ie ever had at a restaurant. My date and I went up to the bar to have a cigarette and another glass of wine after dinner at which time we met Mr. Michael N., the owner. He was so gracious and grateful to have us in his restaurant, and best of all, sincere in his attempt to connect with us, his customers. We ended up chatting with him for over an hour, at which point he invited us out for a cocktail at Webster Wine Bar, where he bought my date and I a bottle of wine, and asked politely for us to consider his restaurant again.All in all, the people at Naha make the restaurant move from good to great, and I would highly recommend a chat with Mike if youe ever so lucky to catch him there on a weekday night. I will be back for many years to come.', 'Went here the other night for dinner and had a great experience. Naha is a restaurant that serves American food with a Mediterranean feel. Many people think that Naha is a Japanese restaurant, in fact, there were those in our group who were expecting sushi. The name Naha actually comes from the last name of the two owners of the restaurant (Nahabedian). Located at the northwest corner of Illinois and Clark, Naha is a good place to come for creative, unexpected tastes.Upon entering the restaurant, you enter a nice bar area. The liberal use of concrete in here (floor, bar) could be stark but the hardwood floors, dark wood tables and crisp white linens quickly warm up the space. The bartender (James) pours a mean martini and for a pleasant surprise they have feta cheese stuffed olives instead of the more traditional blue cheese. You should also try the Pinot Noir or the Syrah that is privately labeled for Naha- both are delicious.Moving on to dinner- if you go, ask to sit in one of the round booth areas just out of the main room (the first time I was here I sat in the main room and it felt a little crowded to me). It is much more intimate in this area of the restaurant. Since the booths are big- they will not work if you are there as a couple but if you go with a party of 4 request it- its worth it.We wanted to try a few different things so the waiter kept bringing us different menus- ask for them if they are not offered- they each offer totally different items. There is a lounge menu (great appetizers) a dessert menu (tasty cheese flight) and then the dinner menu. We chose to order off of all three. For appetizers, we had the filo turnovers, the calamari, and a flatbread. While they might try to dissuade you from ordering the flatbread as it takes an extra 15 minutes, it is well worth the wait (also it didn seem like it took 15 minutes although it did come after the other appetizers) Thin flatbread topped with pesto, sundried tomatoes and feta was absolutely a hit with everyone at the table. Our second favorite was the calamari. It was served on top of a spicy sauce and it was a sizable portion- big enough for 4 to share.As for dinner, the menu changes daily so there are no specials- everything for that day is on the menu. For our entrees, we tried the Skate Wing (fish), the ribeye and the venison. The fish had mixed reviews as while it has a really mild flavor, they do a nice job of surrounding it with really flavorful vegetables. The venison was a hit as was the ribeye (they carve it daily so the size changes) It was served with some kind of feta mac and cheese side that was delicious and would have made a great entree.For dessert, the cheese flight caught our eye and we were not disappointed.The service was great- the only thing that we all commented on was that the waiter read our order back to us after writing it down. As one person said, it felt a little TGI Friday like as in most fine dining restaurants the wait staff not only doesn write it down, but they certainly don read it back to you. Small point, I know. Other than that, the service was attentive and friendly.For those of you driving, there is valet parking ($12). So if you are looking for unusual flavor combinations, served in great surroundings, by servers who go out of their way to make your evening memorable, your should give Naha a try. I doubt youl be disappointed!', 'Naha is solely responsible for my current beet obsession. Did you know they turn your poop bright red if you eat enough of them? Fascinating.Seriously though, we went here for a department holiday dinner, and I was very impressed by the food, service, and atmosphere. We had the semi-private room at the back, which still allowed us to feel somewhat connected to the rest of the restaurant, but provided us with the ability to be loud and raucous without disturbing others. Our wine and water glasses were never less than full, without having to be overly aware of the constant service. The various courses of contemporary American food with creative complementing flavors were delicious --- I would highly recommend Naha for a group affair.', 'Came here on a Thursday evening in search of a hamburger...oops. The burger is only served M-F at lunch. Our server was incredibly nice about it - probably nicer than any server Ie had, ever. Especially at a nice restaurant. Came back a week later at the appropriate time and it was well worth the wait.The restaurant smells of vanilla when you enter and has a clean aesthetic. The presentation of the food was cluttered, with lots of side plates, extra utensils, and oddly-colored and shaped plates. The bathrooms are clean and very nice.The burger was outstanding. Less meat than you would find at other places, but the accoutrements make up for it. First, the bun is thick and has a crispy crust with a pillowy center. It huge. The tomato has been stewed and has a nice tang to it. The caramelized onions add another layer of flavor finished with this tangy sauce that was part mayo, part mustard, all delicious. The cheese selection was unreal. I wanted to quote Tron and thank our server for the wonderful selection of cheeses, many of which Ie never even heard of before. They had cheddar, swiss, mozzarella, bleu, goat, manchego, and on and on. The goat added a nice tang without overpowering the other flavors. Finally the fries were dusted liberally with salt and some herbs and were some of the better fries Ie had in a while.I can attest to the other items on the menu, although I would like to go back and try them. Certainly worth going out of your way at lunch for a burger.', 'Had dinner at Naha on VDay - fabulous. Loved every bite and it was worth the hefty price tag. We even received little bottles of honey that had been used in our entrees as a gift - very thoughtful.Went with a vendor for lunch a week later - yuck. The lunch menu is not as inventive as dinner. The burger looked good, but only one fish option for lunch? Wuh-huh? I ended up getting an open-faced serrano ham sandwhich. It was a sad looking piece of ham on a too-toasted slice of bread. Not exactly on par with the evening menu.', 'Yum yum yum....this is a great restaurant. The food is delicious and the service is up to par with the place!!!', 'when my father or some rich person willing to pay for a meal is in town, i always suggest this place. the food is so good and so is the wine. i totally dig everything about this place and enjoy going there immensely. the duck is one of my favorite dishes. i wish i was there right now.', Meh... I don't know if I was bored with Naha because I went there with the dullards from my office, or if I was bored because its a boring restaurant. Probably a combination of both. The food was fine, the service was okay... but all in all, I was underwhelmed. I wasn't wowed by the menu and I just wanted something simple for lunch, so I ordered the goat cheese and fennel omelet. Let me sum that up for you: it was a $15, goopity-with-goat-cheese omelet. Oh, and it came with fancy, cubed potatoes. Right., My friend took me here for my birthday. I loved it. The decor of Naha is beautiful. The first thing I noticed were the settings and plates on the table. Elegant, sophisticated, clean, modern, and well-designed. Even my friend (who is a total guy's guy) noticed the plates and made a comment on their cool design (They are Bernardaud... of course!). The tables are large, so you feel like you're sitting far away from the other person. Our server was very knowledgeable on the menu and was able to make great wine pairing recommendations. I started with the beet salad - perfect way to start a meal. Red and white beets, in a salad of greens, sprouts, walnuts and warm goat cheese. It was simple, but fantastic. My friend had the scallops, which were cooked to perfection. For the main course, I went with the salmon - as recommended by our server. It was fantastic :) It was served over spring peas, morels and the best potato gnocchi I've ever had. My friend went with the venison, which was cooked in a three day-aged balsamic reduction and then cooked in a splash of cabarnet. It was very well done, and you could really taste the cabarnet. Venison is normally very hard to do well (it's hard to get over the gamey texture)... but Naha did a very good job. We ended our meal with espresso and biscotti... perfection again.The only negative was that the food took a very long time to come out. We started dinner at 8:30, and finished at 11pm. Our main course came out at 10. They really need to work on that one.I will definitely come back to Naha., I was taken here for my birthday lunch and thought the food was excellent. For my entree, I had the Barramundi and although it was very good, I keep thinkiing about the Naha burger that I had a bite of. It definitely one of the best burgers I've ever tried. We had a few appetizers, there was very tasty tomato salad appetizer that was light and full of flavor. Love the minimal design. Naha is on the pricy side, so unfortunately I don't think I will be going back as often as I would like., 'NAHA is Uh Huh in my Chicago dining book.Prices were reasonable for the quality of food being presented, the scallops appetizer was quite simply one of the most delicious starters that I have ever enjoyed. The NAHA Sundae was delish, with bits of peach crumble to offset the smoothness of the vanilla ice cream.Our meals consisted of the prime steak. Though average in cost - about $48.00 for this quality of meat, they were a little fatty, as opposed to being well marbled, but overall, they were fantastic. I tend to be one that sticks to steakhouses for steak, however, I knew that the reduction would make this a wonderful choice - and it was.Service was prompt and friendly, the atmosphere was somewhat relaxed, unlike other restaurants in this league.', I love places like Naha, because I can come home and trash them on Yelp. We got five cheeseburgers, four appetizers and three desserts and it was $200 -- BEFORE tip. I got the burger because people kept telling me it's one of the best in the city. Really? Do people honestly believe this or do they regurgitate it because some asshole on Metromix wrote it? The service was pretty good but it's not like they taught my kids how to read. For these prices, I'm better off grilling up a half pound of ground chuck and using the difference to buy a new set of rims., 'I finally made it to Naha and really enjoyed it.The restaurant is very elegant and modern. The service is fantastic. I started with the scallops with Prosciutto, Sweet English Peas, Pearl Onions and Lavender and had the mezze platter for an entree. The scallops were perfectly done and the mezze platter was top notch. The Feta turnovers were outstanding. Beautiful presentation and extraordinarily tasty.For dessert, I had the Mascarpone Cheesecake with Chilled Italian Plum Soup and Fennel Sorbet. It was outstanding.In the end, I loved the food, the atmosphere and the service. I am not sure why Naha is not talked about in the same breath as Blackbird et al, because it should be.', 'If One Sixty Blue, Kevin and MK are amongst your favorite dining spots then read no further and make a reservation at Naha because youl love it!The Naha experience is best explained with the chocolate amuse bouche. Friends quickly asked me, what does it taste like?, and my reply, a Ho Ho, and its good. However, the last time I checked, a Ho Ho doesn cost $115 per person. The high end Ala Carte restaurant scene is fiercely competitive in Chicago. The food is good at Naha, but your dollars value is better served elsewhere. Naha boasts an 18 ounce rib eye for $47. Wow, I thought the one at Gibsons was rather good for $36. The resh eggappetizer was delicious. The plate featured a sweet soft boiled egg on homemade toast, with deliciously sweet cubes of potato, tasty smoked pork, and chorizo. That chorizo was sensational, and the portion wasn skimpy. Atmosphere is modern, with pleasant and efficient wait staff. Three hostesses cheerfully greeted my party at the door and a table was quickly available. Naha feels as if it could be transported to midtown Manhattan with large window panes that allow diners to admire the city, and passers-by have a chance to watch the gray haired set feast on expensive food. If Naha were in New York City then you wouldn think twice about the price, but this is the Third Coast.Let me be clear that an expensive restaurant doesn make me shriek; value is critical. For something in the same price range with considerably more originality then please try Blackbird and North Pond. If you can stray further away from the Gold Coast, then Janes, Sola, or West Town Tavern are worth a serious taste.The next time an invitation for Naha comes my way, nah is what Il say.', 'We stopped in here after a dinner at Zocalo, looking for dessert. Yeah, it a fancy place, but they were super cool - they seated us straight away for dessert, brought us the menus, and our server was nice and laid back about the fact that we were just eating dessert, and had been prepped ahead of time by the host. So, a well-oiled machine.And dessert, well it was fabulous. We had the tarte, which was yummy and had homemade chocolate ice cream along with it. Our friends had the Naha Sundae which was a fancily-plated hot fudge sundae. All good.So, why the middlin3 stars? Value. The cup of black coffee I had with my dessert: $4. Our (on the small side) desserts? $15. The tea? $9. For two desserts, a cup of coffee, and a tea, cost us about $50.Now I knew I wasn at this place for cheap eats. And the service really was excellent. But the food was good, but not good enough to justify the price.For the fancy restaurant scene that exists in river north, I not sure if Il be coming to Naha for a full-on dinner. I feel my money could probably be better spent at numerous other places.', 'Good food, but definitely overpriced. 3 meals, 1 appetizer, and 2 glasses of wine came out to $170 before tip. They have a wide variety of gourmet foods on the menu, but I felt like my meal (monkfish) was lacking a little something. My friend got trout, which looked and tasted like salmon that was dry and needed lemon or some type of acid. Service was very good, and overall a nice experience, but i think there are better restaurants for the money.', 'My company came here for our Christmas party last year. In their defense, my coworkers can get pretty rowdy. But, it was nothing harmful, I promise!We spent a ton of money with them, and they were nothing but rude to us. The service was slow, and the portions were uneven. I gave them 2 stars because my food was pretty good. But...we had the basement rented, which included a bar. At some point they decided we had drank enough, and closed the bar without telling us...basicly they cut us off. When we got the bill, there were a lot of extra expenses, and it was more than the original estimate.', Yes it's expensive. Moving on...The service here is wonderful - I've had great servers each time I've been with really solid recommendations for wine pairing. I also love the food. While it's not earth-shatteringly creative, it's consistently delicious and in my book that's the most important thing. Here's what I've had there recently, and I'd recommend them all:Beet salad with blue cheese, mache, applesScallops appetizerLake Superior Whitefish with chanterelle mushroomsShort ribs with roasted veggiesMascarpone cheesecakePumpkin deliciousness that I can't even begin to describeYum and double yum. I'd go back tonight if I had the cash to burn, because yeah, it's not an every day sort of restaurant, but it's great for a special occasion., Get ready for me to gush! I just had dinner last night at Naha and can't believe the bad reviews of the place that I have read on here. I thought the menu was great. The food was that we had was a great mix of complex flavors that came together and somehow tasted simple, heavy sounding winter ingredients that somehow didn't taste heavy or seem too rich. There wasn't a single bad part of the meal, but the quail I had blew my mind. Food perfection! The server we had was great, the dining room is great and this has jumped tot he top of the list as one of my Chicago favs., Great food & Atmosphere, don't miss the tuna appetizer, The service was excellent and the food was quite good but I'm not sure it is a place I would go back to for dinner. The decor is really cool and the food is very fresh but when I looked at the menu nothing really grabbed my attention. We tried the tuna tartare and Greek salad for appetizers and the squab and venison for dinner. Everything was good but something was missing. I'm not sure what it is but it's not like Blackbird, Avec or one of my other top Chicago places that I feel like I have to come back for dinner again. I would however like to try lunch as their burgers rate near the best in the city according to some reviewers., While thumbing through some of my reviews I was surprised to find I've somehow managed to skip over Naha. It was a glaring omission I decided to remedy at once since Naha is easily in my top 5 (eh, maybe top 10) places to dine in Chicago. I love Naha for making birthday dinners, date nights and evenings out such an easy choice. This is the type of place I love to bring out-of-towners, clients and my parents to showcase our city and make an impression. Naha is sleek and upscale without the pretension and stuffiness of a 'dining jacket required' destination... You can come here on a Friday night with your honey and get the same level of service and quality without having to wear a tie or schedule 5 hours for your dinner plans. The decor is contemporary, but not cold. I'm not sure if it is the influence of their California-based architect, but Naha gives off a definite West Coast vibe to me, dressed-down elegance, simple and classy. I've visited Naha at least 5 or 6 times and I've yet to be let down by the service. Their staff has always been attentive and extremely knowledgeable on the food and wine selections.. they are trained well and it shows!! I've been educated on new wines from the expansive and well-rounded list and two of my favorite wines now were originally suggestions made to me here. The menu rotates with the seasons and availability of ingredients - you know if something is on the menu at Naha it's because it's the best and freshest of whats out there now... hence the inflated price everyone seems to be griping about. Quality and Complexity don't come cheap unfortunately... whoever said that the best things in life are free was clearly CRAZY!But what you will get for your money are scrumptious and inventive dishes. I love the coddled egg benedict starter with chorizo, radishes, potatoes and bacon on a frisee salad. I also dig the yellowfin tuna tartare with sturgeon caviar. My favorite entree is the braised short rib and I order it almost every time... the quality of meat is amazing and the polenta and black truffles it comes with are so freaking good they make me blush. The honey lacquered duck always sounds mind blowing, but I've yet to pry myself away from the red meat. Tsk! Tsk! I've never been too thrilled on the dessert offerings, but I think it's usually because I'm already hiding the popped buttons on my pants at the end of my meal. Everything that I do try at Naha though makes me smile and I know they'll keep me coming back again and again... I'll have to try that duck eventually afterall, hopefully sooner than later., The food was ok but def. not worth the money. Portions were small (and no, i'm not a glutton) and the flavor was bland. Our waiter was cool- but I wouldn't eat here again., 'riddle me this, if you were to participate in restaurant week in chicago, wouldnt you try to provide a menu that would impress people and leave them wanting to come back to try the regular menu? I came here on friday for the prix fixe meal and I was truly dissapointed. I understand fine dining, quality over quantity, but I feel everything that my table ordered off the menu was just sitting in back under a heat lamp in a production line. I had the squash soup which was ok, the fish and a pineapple tart. Everyone at my table tried different things and no one was wowed by anything. my fish was REALLY bad. It seriously taste like canned tuna, and my friends salad was seriously just bagged romaine and a wedge of cheese. wowie wow wow. we were all still so hungry when we left, we were lucky we drank enough to just go home and pass out. oh well, maybe im not such a classy lady after all.and our waiter was kind of a snob, which is a shame, because im a 25% percent tipper no matter what. i should have saved my thirty bucks and invested in a number 2 at the rock and roll mcdonalds.wont be back.the bread plate was good and so was the butter. I should have taken that as a consolation prize. Klassy!', 'Gotta love restaurant week....the chance to try fancy schmancy restaurants for their $31.95 prix fixe dinner specials. Naha, which has been on my list to try for a while now, seemed like the obvious choice to kick off restaurant week. I was immediately a fan of the minimalist, upscale atmosphere. As for my meal I picked from the restaurant week menu. Appetizer: A salad with pears and a delicious wedge of cheese (not sure what kind of cheese, but it sure was good!). So fresh tasting!Entree: Whitefish cooked in lobster sauce. It had a really strong taste that I wasn sure about upon first bite, but it grew on me as the meal wore on and I ended up really liking it.Dessert: Dark chocolate cake. Yum, just yum! But this is only for those of you who love super rich desserts.My fiance loved the butternut squash soup he started with and the pineapple tarte dessert he ended the meal with. He ordered the quail as his entree and was a little disturbed by how raw it was, but then again the waiter did offer to cook it some more when we voiced our concerns.Service was so-so, but it was the first night of restaurant week so there were probably more diners than usual. When leaving I asked my fiance if this is somewhere he like to return and he said not at their usual prices. And I have to agree that although it was good I probably want to go somewhere amazing (May Street Market anyone?) for their prices.', 'Yes, the decor is nice, but the food tastes like it was rolled in salt and the service is TERRIBLE! The waiter was upset when we sent back an undercooked pheasant, and said, that how it served here. Sorry if the feeling of squishy poultry between my teeth isn appetizing. We felt rushed and ignored. The best part was the dessert, but that wasn nearly worth the price tag.', My last chance to enjoy Restaurant Week before I headed to O'Hare to go home. The restaurant was quite busy for lunch on a Monday which was good to see. I knew I had come to the right place. To start I had the chilled Wianno oysters. They came out as a set of 3 and was topped with creme fraiche and candied citrus rind strips. Excellent combo of flavors from the tangy creme fraiche to the sweet candied citrus to the salty oceanic goodness of the oysters. The entree I chose was the whitefish with slab of Kurobota bacon. I'm basically ordering anything with bacon so I was thrilled to enjoy the Kurobota slab. The whitefish was tasty and buttery but on the small side. But I guess that was to be expected for a special prix-fixe menu. The dessert was the coup-de-grace (French phrase, wiki it). It was a decadent slice of dark chocolate cake with a scoop of black forest ice cream (chocolate ice cream studded with cherries) and small dollops of pinot noir sauce. I think the cherries in the ice cream might have been soaked in the pinot noir as well. Pure heavenly deliciousness. The pinot noir sauce was something I had never had and was something that set the dessert over the top for me. I thought the meal was done but an extra gift from the pastry chef was presented to me. It was a plate of a couple small petit fours. One was a cake layered with chocolate cream and the other was a lemon curd sitting on top of a cookie. Pleasantly satisfied by the meal. The wait staff was on top of things from clearing my plates to refilling the water. Definite value for me and a nice ending to my trip to the Windy City., I too went for restaurant week. The hostess was very nice, and while we were waiting in the front area a server came by and asked us if we wanted a drink while waiting. We were seated pretty promptly as well. Our server did not seem to be thrilled to be there (don't know if it was just impatience with us, or if he was just having a bad night in general). I had a Sidecar which was tasty but not very strong and a bit pricey. My appetizer was the acorn squash soup and was excellent, albeit a bit salty. Someone else in our party had the trout, and said it was good but not great (thumb between up and middle), and I noticed it was a pretty scant portion. Another friend had the salad with pomegranate seeds and she enjoyed it. For the main course I had the whitefish, which was much smokier than I expected, and I didn't like it at first but it grew on me. My friend's risotto seemed like a pretty small portion too. For dessert I tasted the pineapple tarte, it was pretty good, but I wasn't as crazy about my dark chocolate cake (and I LOVE dark chocolate). The amuse bouch desserts of a passionfruit tarte and some other chocolate thing left me totally unimpressed.I would probably give it another shot for a prix fixe, but most likely would not go back for full price., 'had high expectations for this place, but was let down. food was all very salty and service as not up to par for such an expensive restaurant. much better restaurants for the price.', I came here for restaurant week as well. This place gets an extra star for having great service (from the coat check and hostess to the wait staff), decor - spacious, and wine selection.I read some of the reviews on Yelp before going so I was somewhat prepared, and yes as most have said the food was slightly salty. We each tried a different appetizer and it was unanimously decided that the trout was the best (served similar to lox) though I did enjoy my salad with pom seeds. We also ordered the gnocci for the table (off regular menu) and all enjoyed that as well. Whitefish was good but again slightly salty. My brother's quail was ok, but I think he was regretted not trying the risotto with ox tail. Desserts were good - maybe the highlight for me (Pineapple tart or dark chocolate cake - any dessert served with ice cream is a winner to me!) Overall, the food is not what you would expect. Yes, it is small, creative and fancy but not as flavorful as I would expect., I wish that half stars were available, as this is really a 3.5. In reality, I consider Naha to be a place to eat so that you can say you did it. While the food is very good, the service leaves a bit to be desired. I suggest this locale to see and be seen and have a nice dining experience, but don't expect to dream over the food., Absolutely Love this Place....The experience started out at the bar which was comfortable and completely unrushed. I enjoyed a single cask strength bourbon served with ice and purified water on the side. When finished we asked to be seated and were escorted to our table. The waiter took our orders and was very helpful in choosing a bottle of Oregon Pinot Noir which went well with both my meat dish and friend's seafood dish. For appetizers we had the Scallops and Berkshire Pork Belly. For the main course trout and perfectly prepared short rib dish. And a finish with the home made NAHA sundae. This was as close to a flawless meal I have had in the past year. I highly recommend NAHA for a spectacular meal and any special occasion where the food and experience is more important than the price., 'This place was pretty good. Reading others reviews makes the service seem spotty - we had decent service. The food was good, wine was good.I want to give it 3.5, but I will round up. Do it to say you did, and find some other place to dine.', 'Although I said RL has the best salmon in the city year round, Naha served up my Best Meal Ever. It was spring 2007, Copper River Salmon. Baby asparagus, peas, and other greens. Essentially: spring on a plate. I rave about the meal time and time again. Please make sure to try it.She also has one kick-ass burger. And I love burgers.', Sooo, their menus are printed daily, so they are never identical on two consecutive days. I ordered the Great Lakes whitefish with a bunch of other stuff and the scallops appetizer... Boy oh boy, they were both sooo divine; very unorthodox but delectable flavors, perfectly seared and fried and baked or whatever the hell they do. My friend ordered their trademark dish, the squab with duck liver, which has the craziest presentation. It comes with the legs still attached, and beautifully garnished with herbs and spices and some other stuff I'm sure. It tasted pretty good too, but I'd like it more well-done. Oh, and oddly enough, I think their sauces are the true winners, they are exquisite. The best part of the meal, surely. They have a lot of seafood and birds on their menu, so it's great for people like me, who are not big on pork and beef. Overall, it is rather pricey food, but it really is very good. I was also by far the most underdressed here, in terms of fanciness, but some of the women definitely wore less in terms of surface area of clothing... I feel like Naha may as well be in the Viagra Triangle. The waitstaff is just fantastic, which is when you know you are really paying for your meal. I'd come back here on a big occasion or a business lunch/dinner, but not often, just too expensive., I think Naha is such a classy place. The decor is really sleek and the service is unreal. I've dined here a number of times and each time the menu has been different. SO F'ING sad that they banned Fois Gras in Chicago (goddamn hicks) because Naha's was THE best., 'One of my most liked restaurants in the River North area. It has some great menu options and the service is one of the best in Chicago. I have been here a couple of times, usually in the afternoon during lunch time and the food and service is pretty up to par with some of the other nice restaurants in Chicago.The cappuccino was amazing and i really like their dessert selection. Pretty nice place for a good meal!', 'The last time I ate in this space, it was Gordon which I loved. This was even better. Loved the minimalist decor. Every table was filled on this Wednesday eve. I reveled in the carrot soup, which was divine with its touch of crab, baby peas, cilantro, and other stuff. The softshell crabs (and I do mean plural) were a hefty portion, surprisingly, and I ate every buttery bite. Pricey, but worth every dollar.', So have to admit havent been here in over a year but we came here on a recommendation for a night out on the town.The main thing I remember was that the food was very tasty and portions were very nice sized, bigger than I thought. I believe wife had a monkfish entree and I had scallops.Our server was a joy and the main reason I would come back. We opted for a bottle of wine we were not familiar with but was her recommendation. She extended the offer of trying it and if we didnt not like it she would get us a different bottle. Since this was not offered by th glass I felt that was a very nice gesture. She was attentive but not overbearing and fed off of our needs and level to provide great service.Kudo's and if your looking to drop 250.00 plus for a dinner and nice tip Naha is a solid choice in River North area., Naha had been on my list for a long time, but I was waiting for an expense account or a date to go there. (I got the latter). Very inventive menu - definitely not good for people who are uncomfortable with 'out there' ingredients or combinations of flavors. Overall, my meal was good, but it was all exceptionally salty, which was very offputting. Portions were small (my date was so hungry at the end that he actually ate more bread to fill himself up). And the bread itself was TERRIBLE. (OK, I know I shouldn't judge a restaurant by its bread but, well, I do. Naha's bread was uninspiring and its texture showed that it had been sliced many hours earlier and was left to harden in the air). With so many great restaurants in Chicago, this one was just too pricey to go back given my experience there. I'd spend my $ elsewhere before going back., 'Update: I like to update this to say that the chef responded to this thread over on lthforum.com. I encourage you to go look at the site and find the post to see his response. Ie not changed a word of my review (except a very minor edit that didn change the content) as this truly reflected my singular experience there, but I thought it was fair to give the chef his due.So last night we ate at Naha. Why on earth this place got an award at all is so far beyond me. The service was laughably bad and the food was just ok. We got there at about 8:30 or so without a reservation but the dining room was only about 1/2-3/4 full. We asked if there was room for us and they said absolutely. We sat down and waited. And waited. And waited. Eventually our server dropped the menu and took our drink orders, which nicely enough were returned with lightning speed. OK, looks like it going to be ok, or is it....?Then we waited...and waited....and waited... to place our orders. OK, as an aside, I know wee talked about using quotation marks on menus, but Naha is completely insane. We counted two dishes that didn use quotes in their descriptions. Listen, if youe going to call it Korobuta pork then I going to assume you aren really using Korobuta pork, especially when your waiter is completely flippant about it when I ask.Fine, we get our orders taken, two appetizers... and then we wait. With an empty glass in front of me we wait...and wait, and finally Ie had enough and I flag down a waiter and ask to see the manager. Our food is finally dropped right as the manager comes by- at this point I was ready to send our food back and walk out. The manager made no apologies for the wait on the food and told us that the chef was unhappy with our food and it had to be remade, that why the wait was so long. First, I call complete and utter bullshit on this- one of the appetizers was soup and the other was a pretty simple gnocci. Also, my gnocci came out luke warm- so if this is the best they can do this is terrible. I mentioned to the manager that if that was the case then someone should have told us so we weren sitting there with empty drinks just waiting. So what would have been the obvious reaction to this from any decently trained manager? Apologize and either take a drink order yourself or send a waiter over right away to take another drink order, or even better yet, send something over to the table. Nope, gotta wait another 20 minutes or so to see a waiter. The next waiter comes over, asks how things were and laughs about how it took so long to get our appetizers. A laugh? Really? We just talked to the manager, do you think we find this really amusing?We finish our apps and wait...and wait...and wait and I flag down the waiter again and ask him to drop the check. He does so with our second set of apps which were just ok. Again, my food was served luke warm. I left a 10% tip (something I NEVER do) and walked out. The manager caught my eye as we were walking out and couldn be bothered to get up from his glass of wine at a table to apologize.This restaurant should be completely and utterly ashamed of itself, it staff and management. Maybe they are already resting on their laurels from their award. In any event, this should be avoided at all costs.', I am beyond tardy in reviewing this culinary orgy, having loved Naha since it was named Chicago's Best New Restaurant some years ago. The recent James Beard award is another reminder of why Naha continues to thrive in a chew-em-up restaurant market like Chicago. I have yet to have a meal here that was anything short of delightful. The creative food pairings, killer wine list (scotch, too!), first-rate service and peaceful atmosphere just never fail to deliver. And one of the best kept secrets in River North is Naha's wonderful little bar. It's among my favorite hiding spots for a quick post-work cocktail, wine soaked client meeting or quiet chat with a friend., 'I went with a friend, 730 reservation. We waited 15 minutes before someone showed up at the table. We place our entire order, we had plenty of time at that point to memorize the menu. The wine comes... and the waiting begins... somewhere at around 820 the apps arrive. which were actually quite good. We finish the apps, finish our bottle of wine, and we are still waiting. At this point it a little after 915, the manager offers us an insulting response of at a fine dining establishment you have to expect a slower dining experience. Almost two hours to get to the main course !?!? In the meantime there are four tops that have been seated after us that are on their dessert. Finally, out comes our food, we then ordered dessert. the chef came out and apologized. She was gracious and did not pass the buck at all, she admitted that there must have been some mistake. She is the reason I giving two stars instead of one. Bottom line, plenty of great restaurants in Chicago, unfortunately Naha seems to have some operational issues, and the chef would do well to take a look at who is running the dining room.', Plus side: Server was great, fresh local food, enjoyed the look of the restaurantNegative: Food just wasn't that great, esp for the price.Wish I could delve more into it than that, but I just feel like it isn't super fantastic, and when dropping some cash I want something stellar., 'I did a lot of research on good Chicago restaurants before choosing this place, and I did so even despite some negative reviews here. I based my decision on it being nicely devoid of gimmicks and super-trendy menu items. And also, even though this was for a birthday dinner for my husband, I wanted to make sure it had vegetarian friendly options for me. Our entire experience here was amazing. We used their $10 valet parking as we were coming from fairly far. When we walked in we were both really delighted by the decor. The window seats with pillows on them looked lovely. Wish I had those in my home! We were seated right away and had a really, really attentive waiter and associated staff the entire evening. J and I were having fun watching how quickly our napkins were re-folded when one of us got up to go to the bathroom. When our wine glasses got low, someone refilled them (we never had to pour our own wine the entire night, and the bottle we chose, a white wine from Alsace, was awesome.) The water refills kept coming as well.But of course, the food is the reason wee there. It was absolutely amazing. We were both kind of swooning. The portions here aren huge. That could bother some folks because of the prices, but we were delighted because it meant we could try appetizers, entrees, and deserts. Neither of us, including tiny appetite me, left with a doggie bag, but we were both full. J started with the Tartare of Hawaiian Yellowfin Tuna (see the menu posted on their website) and I chose Yukon Potato Gnocchi. The presentation was so lovely that we wished we brought a camera. Someone in the back was clearly having fun! Our entrees were the Duck and the Cannelloni. My eyes actually crossed with glee upon tasting the Cannelloni, and my incredibly picky husband called the duck obscenely good. Our deserts were a lemon tarte and an angel food cake. Also amazing. The sorbet that came with them was so light and creamy. The ambiance was perfect while we were here, the service lovely. This was on a Saturday night, too. Highly recommended.', My wife has already posted a detailed review here about our experience, but I wanted to make a few quick comments.I have to say that I'm shocked and disappointed to see that others had either deeply negative experiences with the staff, or merely mediocre experiences with the food. It is a shame when you discover something you love isn't the same for others.We found the staff attentive, friendly, very helpful and prompt. Maybe getting a public upbraiding snapped them out of a rut? I hope so.The food was, quite frankly, some of the best, if not the best, I have ever eaten. I hope they've gotten all the kinks worked out because anyone who goes to a place at this price range deserves to have the experience we had., 'simply put, i was not that impressed.the restaurant itself was lovely but the food was not what i had hoped for. it was 8pm and i was famished so anything would have tasted good but even with such advantage Naha failed me.i must insert a caveat here. although i was not a fan of the taste, naha excelled in other ways. the portion sizes were ideal, presentation was classy and what a great wine selection! ok, so here my two cents...starters...scallops ($17) - super SALTY. i couldn even finish one whole scallop. greek salad ($15) - too much feta cheese. perhaps, IF there a next time i like to request for easy on the cheese.entrees...quail ($35) - plain quail. couldn taste the other ingredients. white fish ($33) - VERY DRY. pork chops ($??) - probably my favorite of the night. cooked medium so it was juicy and tender but nothing special. wine...we selected the recommended $85/bottle wine. our server pronounced the name very ethnically but couldn really explain why she was recommending this wine to us. she said this wine was going crazy for the night because we weren sticking to our typical chardonnay but it tasted like chardonnay to me. hm... i suppose she tried.dessert...cheesecake ($12) - very creamy cheesecake. i prefer cheesecake factory.lemon tartlette ($12) - wasn it just a mini lemon meringue pie?almond clafouti ($12) - we couldn taste anything and couldn figure out what we were eating except for the blueberries. service...for me, moto has set the standard for good service. naha has a looong way to go in comparison. the servings weren timed correctly and the server was not readily available. our wine glasses were near empty several times during the meal. all in all, the menu sounds much more fancy and delicious than the actual. set your expectations low and maybe youl be pleasantly surprised. WARNING: do not go hungry! :)', 'I am in love...LOVE...with Naha. It has been my life quest to find the most perfect cheeseburger and Naha has it! I had heard that they make a good burger, but was skeptical. Now I know, this is THE best burger Ie had in my life! :)Before I tip-toed into burger heaven, I tried the melon soup. There are some flavors that are hard to understand why they go together and I am in awe of anyone that can put them together. Someone at Naha figured out that a chilled melon soup with crab meat, mint, almonds, and red chili would be phenomenal and it was. When I finished my soup I actually said to my lunch pal I really sad that I done with my soup.For dessert I had the greek yogurt custard, which was good. What blew me away was that the custard was served with fennel sorbet. In a million years I never would have thought of fennel as a sorbet flavor. It was so delicious!!I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch at Naha and can wait for another reason to go back.', I don't usually go to high end restaurants but when I do I expect to get what I pay for. As New American cuisine goes, this restaurant does a fine job using organic, seasonal and local ingredients while providing fresh takes on old stand by dishes. We started out with the scallops for appetizer and were very impressed by their tenderness. I had the duck breast, which were perfectly done and so rich in flavors. It actually really tasted like very delicate steak because of the flavor and texture. My boyfriend had the Alaskan Halibut and it was very well prepared as well. The flavor wasn't as rich as I anticipated, but the texture of the flesh was buttery and smooth. The waitstaff was very attentive and didn't complain when we stayed talking until the entire restaurant closed. Our server came by at least once every 10 mins and was never pushy about our orders.I gave the restaurant 4 instead of 5 stars is because I think the prices are just a tad high, especially for some of the appetizers. I also wasn't that impressed with the dark chocolate delice we ordered for dessert. The crunchy ingredient in the chocolate ice cream was a bit overpowering and, for some reason, tasted like bacon bits. It was just a bit disconcerting and didn't go well with the rich chocolate flavor. Overall, a good birthday dinner establishment with romantic atmosphere and good service. A bit pricey but worth it if you count the overall dining experience in addition to the foods., 'Naha is a true foodie delight. If youe looking for a place in the city where dining is an artistic experience (like the ones you see on tv), this is the place to go. If youe looking for an upscale chain classic steakhouse, stay away. Every menu item comes with a paragraph description that takes a gourmand dictionary to decipher. Fortunately, each description has the primary ingredient highlighted (ie, ribeye, squab, scallops). I was here on a work dinner so am not reviewing in regards to price, but the restaurant is expensive.We started dinner with a variety of appetizers. The gnocchi was wonderful- a rich flavor explosion of pillowy-light potato dumplings contrasted with a warm, homey sauce with crunchy nuts and salty ham. Tuna tartare dish looked like a rainbow on a plate- decorated with a colorful coleslaw-type sauce. The romaine lettuce salad was most similar to a Caesar salad and again, looked like a painting on a wall. The scallops were perfectly-cooked, firm yet not chewy, served on a bed of pears. They also had vanilla bean in them- an example of the unique flavor combinations Naha attempts, most of which work. However, another example of Naha presentation- beautiful but small; there was only 3 nickel-sized scallops. Finally, I had the beet salad which was light and refreshing- barely any dressing but lots of multi-colored red and white beets and coupled with a slice of goat cheese on the side. After four (small) appetizers, I didn have an entree, but my colleagues did. The ones who got the short ribs really liked them but noted that they could have used a few more (only about 4 small ribs per plate). Ribeye was a larger cut of beef with a side presentation of a potato with a thin stalk of rosemary sticking up horizontally. Whitefish was served on a bed of mushrooms and other items, which muddled up the plate. Finally, dessert was well, interesting. Turtle sundae tasted great, but how could ice cream, chocolate, and caramel not? Some others were almost a little too creative. The carrot cake was far from traditional. It was a sponge cake served with cardamom ice cream and hazelnut cream with orange rind. PB&J cheesecake was a bit of a stretch too, more aesthetically-pleasing than tasty. The slice was small and made with purple concord grapes, tan-colored peanut butter ice cream, and a yellow brioche on the side. This is a beautiful place for a celebratory experience. There are no fat slices of good olAmerican apple pie there, but the decoratively-dramatic, stylish combinations make up for that.', I had a romantic Valentine's day lunch here, and found the food delicious., 'My husband and I went here for Restaurant Week last year. We also went to one-sixty blue. Naha disappointed us primarily because we felt that we were treated differently than diners not using the Restaurant Week deal. The waitstaff was curt and our courses were brought out with inordinate speed. We were also not thrilled with the food. My husband butternut squash soup was exciting on the first bite but quickly became overly salty. Actually, we found that salt was a problem for most of the dishes. (And my husband has an extremely high tolerance for saltiness!)The weirdest thing for us was the way the menu was written. Quotation marks were used with disturbing frequency. No one wants to eat natural chicken.'|1
37|nico-san-francisco|'I giving this restaurant the benefit of the doubt because it in its soft opening. The restaurant resume is amazing - Manresa and Saison? Yes, Please! it also in a neighborhood that could use a few more upscale eating establishments. The decor is very nice, the wine list is very fair. In terms of the food, we had the roasted beets which were excellent. The pork was also fantastic- perfectly cooked and seasoned. I also enjoyed the fish dish, but it wasn as good as the pork. I did really enjoy the fact that everyone came out to greet me. I thought the serving sizes were a little small in terms of the price point. I recommend a few more veggies on the entree or that they provide bread to help fill you up a bit more. What really disappointed me was the service. The wait staff wasn sure what wines were open or what they would cost by the glass. The table next to ours was getting mouth watering descriptions of each dish and the accompaniments. I was provided information like the beets are roasted or the fish is cooked a la plancha. I also felt that our table was somewhat ignored compared to others. I do understand a restaurant and it staff treating friends and important customers differently, but when there are only four tables being served, the difference is glaring. Honestly, if this was an established restaurant as opposed to one in an extremely early soft opening, the service I received would have earned it a two star review - even with the amazing food. Spruce and Sociale are not that much further (or that much more expensive).I do hope this review is helpful to Nico because I want it to succeed and that my next visit will show that these problems have been resolved.', Nico needs to step up their game. Yes they are in the soft opening stage and very inexperienced. It look 20 minutes after i ordered my soup for them to tell me they were out of it. They have a very small menu and changes from day to day. A lot of French wines and the lady behind the bar was clueless as to wines, she had to review her cheat sheet the whole time and when you are paying on average $15 glass you should know what your doing. Please don't use me as a training ground for your restaurant.I live in the neighborhood and go out all the time, Spruce, Garibaldis, SPQR, Sociale, Osteria, Fresca, etc so Nico you need to step it up.I really wanted this to work as this neighborhood could use another good restaurant, but seems to me somebody wanted to open a restaurant and either does not have the experience or is cutting corners.Remember people in SF vote with the wallet/purse and my vote is still very undecided., 'Our party of eight descended on Nico on Friday, the fourth night of their soft opening, anticipating the normal glitches of a newly opened restaurant. Normally, we would have waited a month or two but, because we live in the neighborhood we had been watching the construction progress for several months and decided to give it an early try. It is a warm, cozy and inviting space with comfortable seating and well-spaced tables and at 630 PM was about three quarters full. Our party had almost all of the small opening menu options--three of the four starters, three of the four mains and both of the dessert offerings. Without exception, all of us thought all of the food was fresh, delicious, well executed and nicely presented. The wine list is nicely organized and well-selected and includes some very good values and some interesting wines not found elsewhere. While our table experienced attentive service, particularly given the newness of the operation, it was obvious that some other tables seemed not to fare so well. It is my understanding that the general manager is highly experienced and has opened and managed other high end San Francisco restaurants. As a result, I expect - and hope - that any opening shortcomings will soon be corrected. We look forward to giving Nico another try in a few weeks time and hope that it will become one of our favorite neighborhood standbys. I am rating this four stars because of the high quality of food, the wine list and the comfortable and inviting space and expect that when the service becomes more settled, a fifth star will be warranted.', 'Went last night with friends after months of anticipating the opening. Everything was as great as I was hoping! The food was outstanding. I ordered the duck which was perfectly cooked, with a yummy raw cod and quinoa appetizer. Also impressed by the recommended wine pairings by the front house manager. Definite neighborhood gem and will be returning.', Was looking forward to this restaurant opening, and it exceeded my expectations! The interior is warm and inviting, and I loved the view into the kitchen. Though the menu is small since they just opened, everything sounded great and my friends and I all enjoyed our meals. The cod and quinoa starter was beautifully presented, and the duck with butternut squash was fabulous! We shared the two desserts - a pear tart and a chocolate mousse, and both were wonderful, especially with dessert wine pairings. The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially given that they're still learning during this soft opening. I can't wait to see what more Nico has in store when they really get rolling!, Was excited to be one of the first to try a brand new restaurant in the city and Nico did not disappoint! Dinner was delicious and the presentation was beautiful. The staff was welcoming and the chef even stopped by our table. The ambiance is warm and inviting. My party enjoyed a very nice bottle of champagne, appetizers, entrees, and dessert. Everything was great! I started with a squash soup with chestnut foam, which was very tasty, and enjoyed the cod for my main course. The fish was very fresh and well-prepared. I went in expecting some glitches given the newness of the restaurant and was prepared to be patient, but I was pleasantly surprised and impressed at how smoothly dinner went! For a place that's only been open a few days, Nico is off to a great start, and I am looking forward to going back., 'Have been waiting for this restaurant to open since I live in the neighborhood and we could use a few more good places to eat. Service and food was great! Beautiful space. Have seen a few reviews and the ones that were disappointed are tough critiques! This restaurant has not even had a grand opening give them a chance! Will definitely go back and if things continue as I experienced them tonight they have me as an ongoing customer.', Ate at Nico on just it's 2nd night. Given the pedigree of Nico himself and Malcolm, our table for 3 came into the experience with high expectations. It's beautiful when even high expectations are met.Ambience - Intimate, peaceful and classy. Price - Exceptionally reasonable given food and service quality. Wine list is playful and unusual. Food - Elegant, tasteful and generous. Enjoyed the beet salad, LOVED the trout entree and despite already being full could not resist a good portion of the pork dish (off of a friend's plate). A few notes of color:-- Can't remember having a better trout entree in San Francisco. It was special.-- The staff without exception was attentive and lovely in how they interacted with us-- Changing both the food and wine menu regularly will be a challenge; but if week 1 was an indication, this place will quickly earn a spot among my regular lineupNico, Malcolm - THANK YOU, Great Atmosphere, Great wine, Great food!A lesson in great design!Malcolm's wine pairing suggestions greatly complemented every dish Chef Nico served.Malcolm also offered an amazing plus; Every night they open an excellent vintage champagne, which is served by the glass until it's gone. Get there quick to get a taste!Chef Nico and team have really hit the mark here! Offering a great 5-course selection with some exceptional wine parings!I ordered the beet salad which came out in a proper portion with the excellent pairing of pomegranate seeds to give it a great contrast.Next course was the Lamb, which arrived perfectly done, and presented. The lamb was perfectly paired with greens and a bit of starch to give it a great full mouth flavor.Last, like all good meals, we had to order every dessert, and all were excellent.The dark chocolate tart was my favorite. The dark and rich coco was out of this world, paired with an amazing lime sorbet. I would highly recommend checking this place out as soon as possible!, 'one of the best Lamb I ever had! a Must! beautiful place, GREAT chef! Will be back....Soon', Nico was in soft opening mode when I dropped by. There are still little odds and ends to be done in finishing the space, but the staff seems to know what they're doing and the owner was engaged and eager to make sure everyone was having a great experience. The menu (which I photographed) is not final, apparently there will be additions with the official opening (I believe it's happening this week). The squid was pretty, well presented, as was the duck. On a deliciousness scale I'd give the squid starter a 3.5 and the duck a 4.25. Portions overall were on the lighter side, so adding an extra starter might be a wise decision. Great to have another fine dining option in the neighborhood and I look forward to going back., The bistronomie movement in SF is starting to gain steam. Places like Rich Table, State Bird, are offering what Chateaubriand in Paris and Relae in Copenhagen are in the area. Add Nico to the mix. Having seen a talk with Daniel Patterson and David Kinch just down the street, we walked into Nico during their soft opening phase. They've gutted a space and built a beautiful dining room and even better looking kitchen. It may look more formal than it really is as the neighborhoods patrons like to be dressed up. However dont let that fool you into not stepping in. The menu is small and concise as are the cocktails and growing wine selection. After looking at the selection we went with:-SQUIDpurple potatoes, avocado-BRANDADE sunchoke, puffed rice, black cod, nasturtium-PORK BELLYcabbage, lentil, apple-LAMB LEGbutternut squash, pannisse, kohlrabi -PEARchestnut, granita, sabld9, crd2me-CHOCOLATEstreusel, buttermilkeverything was excellent. Perhaps one of the best new restaurant meals I've had in SF this year. Nico and Malcolm are both awesome hosts and they're still fixing to get things flowing so they've not announced anything to the public broadly, but obviously the press has leaked their presence. Id say try and get in some early dinners as I think this place will definitely be popular once they get a full head of steam going. Im glad I have a new great eating option in the area especially after seeing talks at the JCCSF. Awesome debut, 'We were so excited to have a new restaurant in the neighborhood, supposedly billed as a casual bistro. With the pedigree from the owners we expected much better. Pork was raw, not medium or medium rare but raw. Sent back and came back medium rare which was fine except for the taste - which was way off. Salsify soup would have been good as an amuse bouche or a dessert. Menu should have spelled out that it was whipped cream with a bit of greens. Way too thick and rich for a soup course. The squashpasta with fava beans was excellent, savory and a little bit sweet with a wonderful presentation. Service was spotty and the servers did not know the menu and had to ask someone else for clarification. The menu does not give details and the servers don know the details. If you look at the 2 other restaurants that have been in the neighborhood for a long time - they serve good, unpretentious food. yes, we may need a more upscale restaurant but this is pretentious food that isn very good. Realize that this is the soft opening so we hope that they can fine tune the menu and that as time goes on it gets better. No comparison to Rich Table or State Bird.', 'I live in the area and decided to try Nico during it still soft opening on friday night 11/8. We went at around 945p so only 1/4 of the tables were filled. The enthusiasm of the owner and manager and the fact that it was in my neighborhood, made me really want for it to succeed. I ordered the beet salad followed by the trout entree. I agree with the other reviewers that the servers didn really know the dish nor could they explain or answer my questions. However, they were nice enough. The food itself I thought was delicious, clean and flavorfull. The manager and owner/chef were often seen walking around talking to the patrons. The restaurant itself was beautiful. In short, I enjoyed myself enough that I suggested to my family/friends who were visiting from out of town to go back the next night (11/9, Sat). My fault for thinking that it might not be busy during it soft opening, so I didn call early to reserve a table for 6. When I did around 6pm, I was told that they didn have anything until 9pm. We took it but since we were walking around, decided to swing by around 8pm to see if they had any openings then for drop in. The restaurant was pretty full compared to the previous night. This is when things went down hill. I knew that we were early. We were willing to accept them to say No, we can seat you. Instead, I was reprimanded for coming too early by Malcolm, the manager. He then told us that he didn want us to be standing around the front of the restaurant, to which we responded that we would move slightly over to the bar for drinks while we wait. To which he told us that he would go ahead and seat us (apparently there was a table to accomodate us) but couldn serve us food for another 15-20min. This was not a problem at all for us since we wanted to have a drink/wine anyway. I understand that they wanted to control how many dishes are ordered at any given time given the chefs in the kitchen and for quality control. However, when one of our waiter accidentally gave us a menu about 20 min later, Malcolm came by, VERY upset, rudely chastising his waiter in front of us, telling them that they couldn serve us yet and that he already said this before! You can imagine how embarassing this was for the waiter and even more upsetting it was for us. Were we not paying patrons? Did we not ordered several bottles of expensive wine while we waited? I felt terrible that I had suggested this place. Again, I understand that the restaurant was very busy and that they had to control the flow of the orders. But if this is how he handles stress (AND at only the beginning of their opening), then I can imagine how hel do when the restaurant becomes busier. We were finally given a menu at our deemed 9pm. The dishes were similar to the night before, so I enthusiastically recommended those that I and my friend had the night before. To my disappointment, the same dish listed came out not only looking completely different then the night before, but MUCH smaller and not as well cooked. I tried to rationalize that the Chef was probably playing around with the dishes since it their soft opening; and that he was probably keeing in mind what he had available that day. However, as much as I wanted to try explain for my experience that night, I just couldn justify the poor service, and the poor food. Malcolm did come by at the end of our meal when the restaurant was half cleared out to apologize (though not really) and comp us our dessert wine pairing IF we order desserts. He didn take ownership for his rudeness to us and his staff. I agree with some of the other reviewers: too many good restaurants in this city to dine at one where the experience left you feeling like second rate citizen and the food was inconsistent. Too bad. I think with more experience, Chef Nico will do fine if he can be more consistent. But Malcolm---- too full of yourself!', 'I very rarely write a review such as this, but it needs to be done. I dined at Nico tonight with my wife and our couple friends (who are French). Where to begin May we have bread and butter please? (they brought bread only), may we have butter please (they brought the butter), ok may we now have a knife for which to spread said butter? thank you It took 45 minutes to bring out the soup, which was our starters. Soup was actually very tasty, as was the Pinot Noir I ordered. It took another 30 minutes to bring our mains ... which were, ummm, not as advertised. - Crispy Trout was flavored well, but no where near crispy. Rather, we could peel off the skin into a glop of scales. - Rabbit was, well, non existent. Ok, to be fair, all the fat that was on the plate was from some animal, clearly not rabbit. We had only two very, very, very small bites of rabbit meat.To add insult to injury, when I approached the manager about my rabbit and that it is nearly all fat and no meat, he told me that is ok, our food isn for everyone. I nearly fell off my chair. Seriously, telling a customer that the food I just waited 1.5 hours for is not for everyone is not ok.Then, the manager stated he would remove the rabbit from our bill (thank you), but when the bill came, he was still charging us for it.This place does have potential, however, they need to significantly improve the service.', Let me start off by stating, I know what a soft opening is and I definitely adjust my expectations and are more patient when attending a soft opening. However, my experience at Nico the other week just downright angered me. I was eager to try out the new little spot after much acclaim from my sister who had tried it out the night before. I love neighborhood spots and to know a great one was only a few blocks away was opening up was totally exciting.We called and got reservations at 9pm. The gal who answered said we could swing by a bit earlier to see if we could be accommodated but couldn't promise we'd be seated. No biggie. Our party decided to pop in at around 8:15 to see if any openings occurred and if not, we would have easily gone somewhere else. The hostess consulted with whom I assumed was the manager. In a condescending tone, he rather scolded us for trying to get seated before our reservations but since he didn't want to have us standing around, would seat us under the condition that they couldn't serve us food for about 20 minutes. Right off the bat, this set me off and I was ready to walk out. Not because I didn't want to wait but his loud voice nearly reprimanding us was ridiculous. But because I was with my family who I don't get spend time with often, I went with it.As we were seated, he reminded us several times that we couldn't order for about 20 minutes because the kitchen is timed by seating. Ok....we get it. You only need to tell us once. So we ordered some wine and caught up with each other. By this time it was around 8:45pm and over 20 minutes had passed. A server came by and brought our menus. YAY! We could finally order! WRONG! Within a few minutes, the manager came by and said he wasn't sure who told the server we could order but they were wrong. He reiterated again that we couldn't order yet because of the kitchen timing, collected our menus and our poor server walked away humiliated. WHAT THE F?!Granted if there was a mistake in the front of the house, there were a dozen ways he could have handled that instead of (1) Humiliating his staff (2) Treating his guests like we were imposing on their time. In hindsight I don't know why I didn't encourage all of us to leave at that moment. The wine we ordered was good but not that good to be treated that way. But perhaps we were in shock that this was really happening. After another 20 minutes went by, we were finally allowed to order. Amongst our party, we pretty much ordered a variety of the menu. We had the Trout Rillette, Beets Salad, Lamb Tongue, Endive Salad, Trout with Clams, and Duck. The Trout Rillette was fine. It needed a little more seasoning but the pickled radish added a nice acidic touch. The beets were also ok and the lamb tongue was just a bit gamier for my taste. The trout with clams also had good flavor to it. As for the duck, I was disappointed. The skin was not rendered at all so it was very flaccid and rubbery. However the squash and chanterelles were nicely seasoned. After another bottle of wine (perhaps to wipe out the horrific treatment we had gotten), the manager came by and rather disingenuously apologized for the slow service. It's a soft opening, we expected slow service. He should have rather apologized for being incredibly rude to us and his server. He then offered to comp us dessert wines if we purchased desserts. How about save the comp drinks and be kind and warm to your guests instead?I will say that the dd9cor of the restaurant is really beautiful. It's inviting, the wood tables are gorgeous and I love the accent pieces. And the kitchen...STUNNING! It's something I would nearly die to cook in.All in all I really, REALLY wanted to like this place. But this was the worst dining service I have ever had and no comp dessert wine will ever make up for it., I organized a private event at Nico and worked with Malcom to plan the event. We reserved the back room for our dinner party. Malcom was wonderful to work with. Chef Nico is extremely creative and his menu was unique - it is not just another restaurant with the same menu. We did the four course dinner with the wine pairing. I definitely recommend the pairing as Malcom does a fabulous job with the wine. Also you must get dessert as Nico's dessert are just amazing!Nico also stopped in to say hello to our group and ensure that we enjoyed our dinner. The space is beautiful and our group had a really nice evening., Poor, slow service. Food wasn't actively bad, but it was very bland and not good. Very expensive for the combo of bad food and poor service. Won't be going again., 'Atmosphere is very nice.We waited 40 minutes for our entree, and when we brought this to their attention, Malcolm, the manager told us wee just having fun and you should have fun too. Waiting 40 minutes is not our idea of fun, not to mention seeing the staff running arpund like chicken with its head cut off. Food was definitely not worth the wait, small portion and lack of taste. We dine out 2-3 times a week, NEVER had a manager say that before, normally take ownership of the delay and apologetic.Not worth spending my money and time.', 'I work in this neighborhood and have anxiously awaited the opening of this restaurant for a year. We ventured in during the soft opening and I will sadly never go back. The evening began and ended badly mainly due to the loud and obnoxious manager. The very worst part of our experience. He was bombastic, complained to us about another customer and yelled at the bartender. Who I assumed he hired and through her own confession had no bar experiences what-so-ever. She admitted she knew nothing about wine either which besides beer is the only alcohol they serve. He yelled at her when she poured a corked glass of wine and continued berating her throughout the evening. The service was exceptionally slow, even for a soft opening. I ordered a sole appetizer, which arrived raw. There was no mention of the fact it was raw on the menu nor had the bartender said anything about it. The entree plates were so hot, we were repeatedly warned not to touch them but the rabbit dish I had ordered, which came on one of those plates was stone cold. The manager took the plate away when I sent it back and never asked if I wanted anything else. We finished our soup which was delicious, paid our bill and left. The manager came running outside after us to apologize, it was so very strange. The next day, I encountered a client who asked if I had been to Nico. I in turn asked if she had at which point we couldn believe that we each shared nearly the same experience, only her was worse! The manager complained about the help directly to them, as the (male) bartender made faces at the manager behind his back. She said it was like a Saturday Night Live show. Slow service, rude manager and under prepared food. I really feel for the staff. What an uncomfortable thing to experience while dining. I will stick with the ever so great Girabaldis for dinner and lunch. Sociale and Spruce too. It really too bad, not just for the neighborhood but also the owners who seem to be very nice people. Get rid of that manager! It your only hope.', Nico is without a doubt one of the best new restaurants in San Francisco. I first dined here last weekend and was impressed by the well-executed food, interesting wine pairings, and knowledgeable staff. I particularly recommend the seafood dishes (trout rillettes, oysters, and seared trout). Nico is a creative chef who isn't afraid of taking risks. I look forward to seeing where this restaurant goes in the coming year., 'We visited NICO for the first time this past weekend and really enjoyed the whole experience. The food was excellent.....not only very tasty but also beautifully presented. The kohlrabi soup was rich, smooth and delicious. The trout was especially good. It was very fresh and not over cooked. My husband particularly enjoyed the oysters on the half shell. They too were very fresh! The beef cheeks were very tender and the pairing with the polenta made for a tasty combination.It was a pleasure to find a restaurant with such high quality food, a warm and appealing atmosphere, and affordable prices.We will definitely recommend NICO to our friends and family. We plan to frequent NICO often.', Went there last week, very beautiful space but bizarre experience. Manager greeted us but he apologized and embarrased the waitress in front of our party. Service was bad and slow. Food was cold. I'm okay with a new restaurant haven't less than perfect food since they're working out the kinks. But never an excuse for bad service., 'Discovered this new local San Francisco gem by accident last night. We heard about this place on SOSH and decided at the last minute to try it with a few friends. The dining room is absolutely beautiful and warm and has a very large open view of the fabulous kitchen. The concept is very simpler and clever where each option on the food menu is paired with a specific wine. I ended up choosing my food based on the wines I wanted to enjoy. Started with a beef terrine that was simple, delicate and perfectly seasoned, followed with a very generous serving of dungeness crab deliciously refreshing. Next I chosen a Cote Rotie which was served to highlight a magnificent loin of lamb perfectly cooked even though I would have liked the edge to be more like crackling. After a bite of cheese - we ended up with an incredibly delicate apple-based desert. The whole staff including Malcom and Nico were super friendly and allowed us to have a very enjoyable experience. Nico is now in my top 10 of SF local gems. Highly recommended', Despite the attractive dining room, not everyone is going to like this place. I didn't. Nico is a restaurant that takes dining, and itself, way too seriously. They take a very pretentious approach, strongly recommending THEIR food and wine pairings that over-complicate rather than enhance the entire experience. If you like to be told what to eat and drink then this is the place for you. Otherwise, for a sophisticated dining experience, with warm service, great food and a nice wine selection I recommend Garibaldi's right around the corner., After waiting a few weeks so they could iron out the 'opening blues', we ate at Nico last night, and it was well worth the wait. A much-needed and welcome addition to the neighborhood with a great ambiance. Very tastefully decorated. The food was fantastic and Chef Nico even came out to our table and thanked us for coming. Nice touch. We were told that each night a new menu is prepared, which is pretty unique. Malcom the wine-steward was very helpful in his wine pairing recommendations and very enthusiastic with his presentation. My wife and I had the beef taurine and trout and both were wonderful. Our chocolate dessert lasted about a minute.The food was very fairly priced and we'll be going back again shortly!, TL;DR - go to Spruce instead.This place is terrible, and entirely because of the service. The setup is this: they are focused on wine pairings with food and function on a menu and wine list that changes daily. Should be great. Here are some examples of why the execution is terrible: Unlike other novel restaurants (i.e. State Bird, etc), they do not explain their system at all.  They have 3 different menus, but to no explain this in the beginning. Aperitif, Food & wine pairing, wine list.  You do not have a dedicated server. This leads to MASSIVE confusion and being asked several times if you have ordered, what you ordered, etc. The waitstaff is so focused on trying to remember the daily menu changes, they do not do a good job actually waiting on you. They push you to have wine at every course (i.e. 4 different kinds of wine), which is both expensive and not really what I want to do every weeknight They are rude: the maitre'd pulled our friend's purse clean off the back of her chair, could have damaged the purse and pulled her chair. Instead of apologizing, he condescendingly said he would put it on the floor instead.All that said, the food is good. Unfortunately, they cannot stop tripping over themselves enough to serve it to you., 'I was anticipating the opening of Nico and dined there last week. The decor is very pleasant - smaller, more intimate space with a less is more feel. I enjoyed the soft lighting and appreciated that despite being a smaller space, the restaurant didn feel overcrowded (sort of like Cotogna). I enjoyed the soup, chicken dish and the desserts (chocolate cake and glazed pear dish) were delicious. Also, I ordered a cocktail drink which was so interesting - I forgot the name of it so Il just describe it - Nico fills up about 25% of a small drink glass with this cocktail and you think, Wow, $12 for this? I believe it was some orange flavored drink. Anyway, it turned out to be really good and I ended up not minded such a small amount of it. If your goal is to get drunk though, this drink is an expensive way to achieve your goal...there are probably cheaper routes. All in all, the experience was good. The manager was nice and came up to my table several times to explain the menu. The only problem is that my husband likes a simple salad, filet and french fries. (Why did I take him?!) The menu at Nico is very specific - they don even serve Coca Cola, instead, they make their own soda which tastes ok. So, if youe not a big foodie and prefer the simple foods in life, maybe Nico isn the best choice for you. It was an experience and I enjoy new experiences. If youe like me, I give this place a go.', 'Perfectly seasoned dishes all the way around. I had the crab with consommd9 and lamb leg. The crab was tasty and presented nicely. The lamb was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. My girlfriend got the cauliflower soup and chicken. Both were great too (cauliflower soup was probably better than the crab but the lamb was better than the chicken). Letting them pair the dishes was great and, Malcolm, the wine director, was great at explaining the wines and why he paired them with the dishes. Chef Nico stopping by the tables was a nice touch. Service was well paced and attentive, without being overbearing. One of the better meals of 2013 for me.', 'We just LOVED our dining experience! The design of the restaurant is warm & cozy, elegant, intimate, but feels spacious...I found it very inviting :) And the kitchen is absolutely gorgeous! I so much appreciated what was offered to us on the menu that evening from the creative mind of chef Nico!! We were so pleased with ALL of our dishes! The staff seemed very happy to be working in obviously a cohesive environment. They were knowledgable about their food, friendly and we never felt rushed. It was a very nice touch to see Nico out at the dining tables as well.I have been telling everyone what a fantastic restaurant it is and look forward to coming back!', My wife and I went to dinner at Nico last night and had a great time. The food was delicious and the wine pairings were perfect. They do a wine pairing per dish and offer up a 3oz or 6oz tasting for each - that was very fun as we got to try a lot of different wines throughout our meal.The service was great and very attentive. The atmosphere was casual elegant and not too noisy.Great restaurant addition to the Presidio Heights neighborhood - we'll definitely be going back soon!, From one Chef to Another, your food was Superb! Lovely Comfortable Restaurant with a Great Vibe, We'll be Back! Cheers Dylan & Linda., 'Exceptional dining experience. Ambiance is seasoned with great looking wood tables and chairs complemented by clean lighting. Service was attentive. The food was great. Flavorful, unique and light. Good portions. Dessert is a must. Will be going back.', I wanted Nico to be my new BFF. It's in my neighborhood, it's cozy/cute/beckoning. It winked at me and I wanted to wink back. But the food was underwhelming, a little bland, average. The service was scattered - who are all these people checking on us? Many different people. You're tempting, Nico, but you've got to back up that cuteness with some substance and vibe., 'We loved loved loved our experience at Nico! Amazing wines - the owner was very attentive and shared unbelievable wine selections with us throughout the evening. The food was nice (portions were on the small side but overall delicious). Highly recommend this place, great addition to our neighborhood.', 'Nico looks somewhat worn and frumpy from the outside; but the inside is really lovely and the open kitchen puts on quite a show. I received a sincere welcome upon entering Nico, and spot-on service. While I did not drink, their sommelier stopped by and we had quite the nice chat. The chef also popped out to inquire on my experience. The food is haute bistro, or so it seemed to me. Plating was beautiful and if portioning was not suited to a trencherman, it was better than you might expect given the quality. A salad of wild greens, hazelnut, and hedgehog mushrooms at first seemed to have a bit too much acid on the plate. But then my stimulated appetite made me reconsider. And they obviously source only the best here. The crab in an appetizer also with endive and avocado was perfectly prepared and there was quite a bit of it. This was a second sprightly start to my meal. A main of black gill rock cod came with broccolini, romesco, and green mustard. This was the highlight of my meal as the fish was perfection. I think the chef has an affinity for preparing fish quite well.Nico is anything but a neighborhood restaurant. It should become a destination place with its elevated bistro cuisine.', At one point I found myself actually counting the number of tables - I was trying to gauge the intimate yet vibrant feel of the restaurant. I found it fascinating how everything seemed to flow seamlessly. The team indeed was cohesive and it didn't feel disruptive being approached by different people - it was timed perfectly. The food, I'm not sure that word does it justice - can one actually eat 'art'' - was magnificently presented. What I love even more so is when that presentation is followed by flavors erupting on your tongue. There were surprises with every dish. Some were instantaneous and others appeared slightly later as you let your palate rest. It was a wonderful experience and I look forward to returning., Usually Michael Bauer reviews are not to be trusted, for example a glowing review of A-16 Oakland was ridiculously overdone. However not being one to hold a grudge I have to compliment him and agree with his review of Nico. Our party of four was greeted amicably and seated immediately. The room and ambience are perfect, not too much noise but a pleasant buzz. It's also nice to see adults dining instead of teenage millionaires. But what about the food? Other than a slightly too long lag time between ordering and the first course being served, the food was wonderful. Everything was perfectly fresh, beautifully presented and actually tasted the way it was described to us by our server, a rare treat. The beignets, veggie cheese fritters were to die for. I had chicken that actually tasted like chicken. The cheese course with a camembert, a goat and one other was great. Wine? I'm glad you asked. Malcom Brownson suggested a French merlot, The second label of a highly regarded French producer. Tasty and not an arm and a leg. He obviously knows his wine. Out of curiosity we asked about a Lebanese wine from the Bakkar valley. It seemed like he was intimate terms with each grapevine of the vineyard. My guess is you would not be able to stump him with any wine related question. He was the perfect host. We will be back., Nico is like a breath of fresh air from the typical stuffy French restaurants serving the same old roast chicken and hangar steak with frites. There is a lightness to the cuisine yet richness in flavor. I loved everything we tried including the dessert. The wine pairing can be by the course and they even offer half portions of the wine. Presentation and service are both outstanding. They explain the wines and don't rush you through the courses. And the prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food and service. Nico himself came out to say Hello which was a nice touch. The portions are a bit on the small side however, and I have to admit to feeling a bit hungry a couple of hours later. But that's a small nit in an otherwise exceptional meal., 'Dreadful service ruins the experience at Nicolas Delaroque modern bistro, Nico.Occupying the space of a fomer Pierre Duex shop, Nico should be a shining star in an otherwise sleepy block of Sacramento. With the now de rigeur reclaimed wood tables and yet another farm-to-table menu, the establishment should revert to selling French country fabrics.With hard floors and flat hard ceilings amplifying the ambient noise, the dining room at Nico is not the place for a quiet conversation. When a member of the wait staff finally appears, diners need to strain to hear the short descriptions of the offerings before the server abruptly vanishes from sight.The menu is painfully brief, listing only three bites, four appetizers, and four main courses; woe to patrons who prefer more choices. At Nico, the menu is not the only thing that is small: across the board, portions were minuscule and prices high.The salsify soup with chicory and (loads of) brown butter ($11) is delicious, but should come with a government fat content warning and perhaps a defibrillator. (Note to chef Nicholas: with that much butter, my shoe would taste good.). Lightly steamed and still crisp, the asparagus ($13) is served with delicate threads of seaweed and the smallest dollop of sabayon. For the price, one would expect more than two spears. Cooked perfectly, the juicy pork loin ($24) is accompanied by sun choke and braised Brussels sprouts.All in all, chef Nicholas does a fine job; it the front of the house where Nico breaks down. Service is glacially slow. After being seated, diners wait ten plus minutes for menus. Empty Champagne flutes appear on the table and wait at least five minutes for their bubbly contents. After asking if patrons were ready to order, the sever disappeared for what seemed like an eternity. Wine ordered to accompany the main course did not arrive until well after the entree was finished. After asking for just a second to debate ordering a cheese course, the wait person busied herself across the room for at least ten minutes.Nico is beer and wine only; there is no full bar. The selection of wines by the glass is tiny and over priced (notice a trend here?), but the bottle list is much better.With such potential in the kitchen it shame that Nico is ruined by front of the house amateurism.', 'Attentive service, nice ambience.Food well prepared but MINIATURE portions, seriously.Prices for wine and food outrageously high vis a vis portions.Nice try to pair wines with food, but menu is way too complicated..four pages clipped together.Even Parisian restaurants with this quality food offer more for your money.All in all, I will not go back.', I've been here 3 times now and had an amazing meal with wine pairings each time. The staff was extremely knowledgeable about every dish and wine, and the food was delicious. They also have a private room for larger groups and the chef Nico prepares a unique pre fixe dining experience. You should have your next special dinner party here! You won't regret it., 'quick review. i feel compelled to write a review since we really enjoyed our meal. we arrived on time for a 6:30 reservation on a tuesday night and were seated right away.the menu changes frequently so your selection of dishes could be completely different. we/i had:all of the bites, ie, small plates which consisted of four oysters, four goat cheese croquettes and two portions of trout rillette all were delicious particularly the trout.parsnip soup, another really satisfying dish. very subtle, served at a perfect temperature in a hot dish. for an entree i had the vegetarian selection which was the broccolini, very tasty. i sopped up the egg yolk sauce with bread.dessert consisted of a sicilian goat cheese paired with a house recommended syrah.we did a byob for wine. a 1 paul lato lumiere grenache. outstanding.all of the dishes displayed great technique but more importantly great flavor. a common thread was a remarkable attention to detail regarding virtually everything.service was ok with the only misstep being a really long delay between apps and entree.all in all a terrific new restaurant that we look forward to going back to.', Went here with 3 girlfriends last week for a birthday dinner. The ambiance in the restaurant is amazing, decor is fabulous, and all around-a beautiful space. We showed up for our reservation and our table wasn't ready for 10-15 minutes due to the previous party chatting away after they had paid their bill. Totally fine, and I know these things happen. The manager went out of his way to give us each a glass of rose prosecco, which was much appreciated.The service was great, the food was delicious as well. The portions were TINY so I'd recommend ordering a few starters before the entree. Also if the beignets make an appearance on the menu, you will not regret ordering them. That, and the delicious bottle of cab franc we ordered for the table were the standouts of the evening.I will be back!, I truly appreciate the servers attentiveness. They made sure my friend and I were comfortable with the setting and the meals we ordered. Although there were quite a few reviews said that the service was poor. But my friend and I both agreed that the service was on the higher standard side, so they've improved their service tremendously.I got there early and had time to capture the interior. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, from the pendant lights to the entry ceiling tiles to the seats. The restaurant spent times to decide on how to put every details together and to create a relax, contemporary and comfortable atmosphere. Not to mention another memorable moment, we're delighted that Chef Nicolas Delaroque came out to greet us. And the restaurant serves both distilled and sparkling water as a complimentary. I am totally a fan of sparkling water, it's rare to find a restaurant serves both kinds of complimentary!About the FOOD!I had 3 courses:Oyster bitesBlack codChocolate dessertOyster bites- My friend told me the mix with champagne mignonette is a great combination for oyster. Turned out, it's amazingly tasty and refreshing! The main course- the black cod was so soft, fresh and moist. Chef captured the favors/textures how fish shall be served. And the crispy skin was also nicely done.Dessert- hey, although the menu didn't say much about what it was, we just took the ingredient- chocolate, to fit our sweet tooth. The homemade soft ice-cream & the brownie crunches were what we're expected. We definitely enjoyed the restaurant's delicate creations and will come back to try another delicious round of selections. I know for sure I won't be disappointed!, One of my favorite restaurants in SF from start to finish. Even though their menu changes every day, it's not hard to remember what I ordered - each one was special.For starters, I had the pork rillettes and the romanesco soup. Both were excellent, especially the soup which was one of the best I've had in a long time. For the main course, I tried both the cod and the duck. Duck was good, not great - but the cod was arguably the best fish I've had in SF, with its super smooth and fluffy meat topped by a perfectly crisped skin.For dessert, I had the avocado and citrus dessert. The avocado really stood out - never could I imagine how good avocado could be as a dessert base., 'Great vibe. Service was flawless. Expected a French bistro, but the restaurant an food were SOOO much more. The wine pairings are perfect. The croquettes were delicately paired with a champagne. Will be treated if you just et yourself go with the chef suggestions. Bound to be a future hot restaurant that takes time to get a reservation. Enjoy. Taste. Enjoy again.', A reluctant three stars..five for food but one for service.Logged in to finally add my thoughts about a dinner we had at Nico in January. I was recalling the fantastic food (ok the portions were small but the flavors incredible! Crab and yuzu yummmmmmm) but while warming up my typing fingers I was scanning the other Yelpers reviews... And then I remembered how completely annoying the manager was - a rather bombastic man, I think that's what he called himself. Now that's all I can think about...my husband couldn't stop talking about how that man ruined his meal for three days after. What a shame. Every comment about the chef or the food (at one point while manager was hovering, I mentioned that I had read Nico had cooked at Manresa and I hadn't had the good fortune to dine there yet...manager repeatedly turns conversation back to himself). I guess he thought he was being suave or whatever but he just came off as a boor.Nico came by to introduce himself, such a nice, soft-spoken, humble man who prepares insanely creative delicious food. I guess you gotta do what you gotta do to get a restaurant open these days...I just wish Nico had done it with a different partner )-:, After reading Mr. Bauer's review, I had to give this place a shot. The place was solid booked for their 2 month window on Opentable., so I waited over a month to get a table this Friday at 6 pm.I have been to some new places this past 2 months including Verbena, Stones Throw, Maruya, Alta CA, The Square, Ala Romana and this place.. all being relatively or very new, I am glad to see the qualities in the new SF restaurant scene.That being said, Nico wasn't my favorite one but definitely enjoyed it a lot.VIBE:I loved it. It was very sophisticated without being opulent. I loved the light fixtures and the color scheme. Also, I loved being able to watch the chefs working.DINERS:Business casual people. It's a bistro, but it's not quite the place where you walk in with t-shirt and shorts on. FOOD:The menu consists of 5 courses (bites, starters, entrees, cheeses & desserts) which you can choose and mix how you want them. (No prie-fixe). The sommelier has picked wine parings for each dish.Croquettes w/ salsify & sea weed : Very tasty. The outside was crispy and the inside was moist and flavorful. I loved the sea weed sprinkled on the top.Asparagus w/ clementine and others : I haven't seen such big asparaguses in a long time. I thought the dish was delightfully done with many details and subtle flavors infused together.Lamb Tongue w/ sunchokes & potatoes : I love lamb tongue, I thought the tongue was very delicate and flavorful. Other ingredients were perfectly cooked and complemented the protein very well.Duck : The duck was perfectly cooked, it was so delicious. I wish they gave us more slices, but the ones we had were quite enjoyable. It was succulent and savory.Nettle w/ fried egg and others :I really should pay more attention to all the ingredients.. or take a picture of the menu. This was a great dish that I enjoyed thoroughly. I wasn't crazy about this dish especially compared to the duck which was served at the same time.Citrus w/ honey ice cream :This was delightful. I was hesitant to order something tart, but the honey ice cream balanced the whole dish so perfectly.I thought it was very nice that the chef Nico came up to us to ask how the dishes were.. well, he is a very good looking guy with an accent.VERDICT:I thought every dish was very well executed, but I didn't get the wow factors from the dishes. I would love to go back again try their another farm-to-table menu., I'm not a fan of giving one star for a review and I don't do it often. But when I have to think about if this was one of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant of this caliber, then one star it is because I can't think of a worse experience. Let's start:- We arrived on time for our reservation but still had to wait 15-20 minutes before we got seated. During this wait, I see a Vince Vaughn-esque waiter with heavy dark bags under his eyes walk ino to the restaurant in a huff. Odd. All night he was running around, but didn't seem to be doing much.- Once seated, Vince Vaughn-eque waiter starts explaining the menu, but was none too coherent and he ends by explaining how they are a big team. Odd again. But, ummm... okay. Then he is gone and does not return, perhaps he thought other members of the team would pick up the slack. We had to flag someone to take our order.- We also had to flag a server down because our wines failed to arrive with our entree. She came back and put our wine glasses down and one of our glasses had water dripping all over still. Really? You couldn't take the 10 seconds to wipe it down? Would it have bothered me if this was a restaurant like Chilli's, or some diner, etc.? No. But you are presenting yourself as a higher end restaurant, then perform like one. I was actually about to snap a pic of the wet wine glass when....- Malcom swoops in and just pours the wine and doesn't apologize for the wet wine glass, doesn't replace it but says the wines will be on us due to the wait. Was it? No. They charged us anyway. So much for the team work and communicating to your staff about not charging us. Sloppy.- We tried six items on the very small menu. Having a small menu is a plus in my eyes because the kitchen can have better focus and make each of the items well. Nope not in this case, of the six only one was truly delicious and that was the soup, sadly. Some of our dishes were missing portions that were listed on the menu, like no polenta with the asparagus and no candied rhubarb in our dessert. To me, the food was underwhelming and under seasoned. Not to mention our entrees were on the cool side when it came to us. Huge pet peeve! And amateurish. Sloppy again.- At the end of the meal, a server comes and says has anyone come to explain the cheese and dessert offerings. No, but shouldn't you know this already? Was I at IHOP where they might say has anyone come and talk to you yet? Are the team members not talking to each other? It appears so.Some times restaurants will have one or the other, good service and maybe meh food or vice versa. It goes without saying, one always hopes to have a good experience on both sides of the equation. But when it fails to deliver good service and good food, it's annoying and disappointing. Poor leadership in the front and in the back of the house. You might think why didn't you say something to the manager? Because we were over it and I was too cranky and my girlfriend was too nice and kind and didn't want to make things worse than it already was. Honestly, with a FOH manager like that, our words would have just fallen on deaf ears., Nico has become our go to neighborhood location. It starts with the vintage magnum of champagne that they pour each night. It an extremely cost effective way to taste 10-30 year old champagne at a reasonable price point. The menu is set up to feel like a tasting menu, but with the ease of a la carte so you don't have to break the bank when you go. We ordered a dish from each of the sections on the menu and loved the presentation of each. The wine pairings don't cost more than $10 per dish, and they do pair perfectly. So excited to have nico in the neighborhood!, 'Absolutely blown away. After reading some of the reviews, I had my misgivings...however, once we arrived to the moment we left, everything was simply done special. From a glass of the vintage magnum champagne to the food, I cannot say what was best. Me: had liver pate (i could have just had more because it was SO good), to the beet salad and then finally, the black cod. My taste buds were screaming: can this get better? Hubby: oysters (perfect size), asparagus (WOW) and the rabbit. We both were more than impressed. The service was divine...AND they wait to clear plates if one of us had not finished! FINALLY a restaurant that gets it!Cannot wait to go back for more...', Wished we like this place. The wine was excellent, sadly the food (and to an extent service) left a lot to be desired.The Croquettes were well completely flavorless. It was as if we were putting fried balls of something into our mouth! The lamb was good, but rare for my taste (I ordered medium). The bread they serve is good, the butter was rock solid. The menu changes a lot, which for some folks might be great, but just leads to spotty taste / quality I felt. The servers had no idea what was good.... they hadn't tasted most of it themselves!!The service well was somewhat spotty. All the serving staff was very courteous but we were served / checked in by 4-5 different people. Not to mention the guy in the front who runs around the restaurant trying to joke etc. poured the champagne like someone would pour say coke!We had ordered beer/champagne with our appetizer and wine pairing with main course. The main course arrived and we finished 1/3rd of it, no rush to bring the wine pairing out! Had to call our server (not being sure at this point who our server was!) twice!)I think this place is doing well and will do well, given the lack of other good places nearby (Spruce being only other place thats newish), but I'd rather spend my $ at places like Park Tavern or Garibaldi's etc., New and welcoming addition to the Presidio neighborhood. Guess they really took a lot of care of their customers - only 5 different servers came to us to ask if we'd ordered. The poached halibut I ordered was good and flavorful. Wish they'd added some of the herbs to add flavor to the croquettes. I think may take off because there are not many options in the neighborhood, but they really need to pay attention to details and be organized., What a wonderful dining experience! From start to finish, very bite was perfection. The dining room is beautifully lit, creating an intimate atmosphere, and plenty of space between tables. The service was excellent, and very well prepared. We'll be back for sure!, 'As is always wonderful to ccidentallyfind small gems like Nico. Not so familiar with the neighborhood, didn know where to find a place to have a quick drink and lite bite, stumbled into Nico and was pleasantly surprised by They have unique presentation of oysters, in lemon vinaigrette sauce on a bed of black pebbles (creative presentation), fresh local grown asparagus simple and tasty. Main course - shared of seabass was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. It happened to be my birthday - so they thoughtfully wrote Happy Birthday on my plate for dessert and pleasantly surprised to meet young Chef Nico, who took the time to introduce himself and say hello! I mentioned to chef that maybe he could modify the signage so it would be easier to see - it was brown on brown, and at first sight, couldn tell the name of the place and whether it was a restaurant or not..until we walked it. Special shout-out to bartender (we sat at bar), who was pleasant and attentive and made us feel welcomed. Unfortunately forgot her name. Highly recommend going to Nico!', The menu changes often and is simple which helps people like me who want to try everything on the menu. Five categories; Bites, Starters, Main, Cheese and Dessert. With 3-4 choice in each category.Everything we ordered tasted great. However, I do feel some items were priced a bit too high. For example, we got the asparagus starter here. It was 3 spears of asparagus for $13. Granted, it tasted really good but $13 is a bit steep for 3 spears of asparagus. They should have put it in the Bites category and priced it at $9. I like that they make their own soda but I wish there were at least two options, not just one.When we ordered coffee, they didn't have stevia or other alternative sweetener options. It also took awhile so we actually finished our dessert before the coffee came out. They comp'ed the coffee automatically at the end. A sign of great service. Service was good but it didn't feel friendly. My only criticism (constructive of course) is to describe the dishes when it's brought to the table. Looking back at the menu didn't help since the menu wasn't descriptive either.The chef makes a point to visits each table. I think that was a really nice touch.The place is small but it doesn't feel tight. Tables were spaced out well compared to many SF restaurants.Nico reminds me a lot of Frances. With some tweaks, I think it can easily be one of the top favorite places in the city., As good as it gets! Here's why:- top notch service from the whole staff including host/hostess, manager, server. Not to mention the chef and his wife who are adorable and generously hospitable- warm yet modern decor- friendly/social ambiance where you can easily enjoy a nice meal and conversation- all ingredients were super fresh- all dishes were perfectly executed in terms of unique combination of flavors, seasoning, and cook temperaturesHighlights: thinly sliced BEETS, ARTICHOKES, BLACK COD, FRESH STRAWBERRIES WITH CREAM CHEESE ICE CREAM, and CHOCOLATE MOUSSE WITH BLUEBERRIESSo happy to have this new neighborhood gem., Came here on a Tuesday evening. We tried almost everything on the menu. Incredible attention to detail (food). Very meticulous. I get the feeling that the chef hand picks one strawberry or one asparagus out at a time for best texture/presentation. We can see the chef(s) in the back being super intense and precise with his movements as you would expect from a master of his craft. I'm not a veggie guy, but the small vegetable appetizer plates were the tastiest veggie dishes I've ever had. The bread was pretty amazing. Never seen such amazing texture and color on bread. The cheese platter has some powerful cheese. Make sure you take advantage of the syrup on the plate to smooth out the pungent flavor. Unfortunately the the oysters were nothing special despite being $2/ea.We ordered all the main entrees. I would rank them like this: 1 Black cod 2 Veal 3 Lamb. The black cod is heavenly (super tender and perfectly seared). I'm not normally a veal person, but this veal was so delicately prepared that I couldn't help but love it. The lamb was superb as well, but not as good as the other two. Make sure you try the white sangria with kumquats.I may or may not have a shed a tear of gratitude when the chef came out to ask how was the food. One annoyance: The round table in the middle was slightly warped causing utensils to slide off the side., 'So disappointed. First, the noise level. On a 2/3 full Thursday night, it very loud -- not a soft edge in the room. Not the atmosphere wanted in a neighborhood restaurant -- yes, I know this is a destination restaurant, but look around at the places that have succeeded in my neighborhood over the years (Sociale, Spruce, Garibaldis) and you see we want a place we can talk to each other when we get home. Second, the portions. My friend and I didn want the 5-course dinner, but we should be able to eat a starter and entree and not still be hungry. Food was fine. I like the half-glass wine option at half, not 2/3 of the full-glass price. But until they fix the noise and the portion size, wouldn return.'|1
38|north-pond-chicago|I've only been here once, because of its prices (entrees start at $30). Chef Bruce Sherman is highly rated, but the fairly traditional American fare isn't unique enough to merit the price in my book. Lucky for them they have the advantage of being located on a lush pond. Can't find that anywhere else in the city., 'North Pond location is probably the most beautiful dining destination in Chicago, situated in the middle of Lincoln Park in a 1920s/30s vintage boat (or field?) house. The interior is tastefully decorated in an Arts & Crafts style. Entrees are not cheap, I think they are all around the $30 range, for my last visit I opted for a 5-course tasting menu which costs about $75, which seems pricey but actually was not bad considering that you might spend that much anyway ordering appetizer/salad, entree, and dessert ala carte. Each course of the tasting menu offered a nice variety different dishes in small portions, each dish I sampled was very flavorful & delicious.Dining at North Pond is an event in itself, it not the kind of restaurant where you should expect to stop in for a quick bite on the way to a movie or show, service is professional but not rushed, dishes are not mass-produced but prepared individually with great care. Diners seem to appreciate taking their time in savoring each course. North Pond would be a bit expensive as any sort of regular dinner destination, but for special occasions where you are willing to spend a few extra $$ for outstanding food, service & atmosphere, it is definitely a worthwhile experience.', I was also here for the same engagement party at Andrea W and I thought this was one of the most romantic restaurants I've ever been in. It was also the perfect spot for an intimate engagement party! The food could not have been better. I had some kind of pumpkin soup that I've been craving ever since. If you are ever looking for a special spot to take a significant other definitely consider North Pond!, 'Mediocre, at best.I have traveled to so many fine dining establishments in tis country and I currently live in Northern California: the home of the seasonal, fresh ingredient movement. North Pond has a long way to go to live up to the level of freshness, flavor and flavor cominations that are available at other season fresh restaurants.We were there for a holiday dinner in early December, The meal was overly salty and all of hte flavors on hte plate ran together with no distinction or pizazz. we had heard great things and were so thoroughly disappointed in hte meal.The saving grace: this gorgeous spot and the comfort of the interior decor. I would never recommend North Pond nor would I eat there again.', 'I had forgotten this but looking at their website, I remembered reading this while dining there: The menu at North Pond is designed to feature products raised or grown in their native environment and offered at their seasonal peak. It just gave me another reason to like the place, but as other reviews have said, this is a place to be reserved for special occasions. I have a feeling a number of engagement proposals have occured here. I went to North Pond for a firm dinner back in November. The setting is unparalleled in the city. It both a treat and a retreat. North Pond is a cozy space that seems much smaller than it actually is since it divided into separate rooms to provide a more intimate feel. The service was exceptional and the entire menu was well thought out and executed.Prior to appetizers being brought out, a tasting portion of pork belly (I believe), was placed in front of us. Since I only eat poultry, I politefully declined. Since my memory fails me here, I remember I had some sort of a cold duck appetizer which I very much enjoyed. For dinner, I had squab for the first time and it was mouth-watering. Ie heard that squab is extremely gamey but I didn find it any moreso than duck which is a favorite of mine when cooked just right. The desserts were downright decadent and afterwards a square of star anise chocolate was brought out while the bill was being prepared. I slept like a baby when I arrived home and dreamed of being able to afford to eat here whenever I like.', 'Nice city views from the front dining room and a relaxing place to have dinner. Food is good, but the presentation and staff makes this a must stop. Good date spot in Lincoln Park.', First time at North Pond. Steven was our server. The food was great. I especially enjoyed the foie gras and rhubarb, scorn me if you will, but it's still legal. We did the seasonal tasting menu and wine pairing - all very interesting. Steven answered all of our questions, provided lots of great information on the wine and really made it a relaxing evening. The apricot tart/brown butter ice cream dessert is not to be missed. I love how the ingredients are local and seasonal. I also enjoyed that another server came by and showed us the cooking technique being used on an upcoming course. Some sort of hen steamed in a wrap inside this cute little kettle. I love interesting food like this - good without being so weird you're a little freaked out. Can get a bit pricey, so I would recommend it for special occasions ... although I've heard they do a fairly reasonable brunch. We will definitely be back., Best wedding gift ever! Well, aside from the cast iron skillet and massive mixer. But I digress--my husband and I were lucky enough to snag a couple gift certificates to North Pond as wedding gifts and immediately called the gift-givers after our meal (sated and a bit tipsy) to thank them for their generosity. Ok, I tried. I tried 3 or 4 times tonight to articulate my experience at North Pond and the words continue to fail me. It is a beautiful atmosphere, with an amazing view of the skyline from a green haven--this wonderful little urban oasis... The service was outstanding--we were never rushed, were welcome to just sit and take it all in before we even ordered our drinks... The food was superb and its presentation lovely. I could write every single detail of the evening and meal and I wouldn't come remotely close to capturing the experience. If only we had more gift certificates! I'm saving pennies for our next meal there, and it will be worth every single one., It has a Five Star View and Atmosphere... I don't think there is any place like it in Chicago! The food is excellent but based on the prices it should be more stunning. (the only reason I didn't give it Five stars!)It's a place for special occasions. The wine list was great. Most people would not be able to afford to eat here very often. I still love it. It is so Romantic and if you want to impress that girl of yours (yes I know she's already impressed) here, You will blow her away!, North Pond is a wonderful restaurant to dine with your lover, your family, or your best of friends. The experience lends to a feeling of comfort and warmth of memories of the past. I spent the week, scouring the restaurants of Chicago in search of the perfect place to dine and look into his eyes. To have the pleasure of succulent delights fill me with an experience that I've been seeking.Chicago is a wonderful city, but I'm from San Francisco, I want organic, I want sustainable food that is regionally produced, consciously created and wrapped up in a nice little presentation for the epicurean.Dropped off at Deming and Lakeview, we took a short stroll, hands interlocked, under the bridge and through darkness to find a arts and craft style that reminds me of a 1920s craftman house . The cold wind was barreling through me, as he pulled me close and nestled in his arms we rush inside to find warmth from the hearth and a view of the pond glistening with the lights of the city... We reminisced about Tavern on the Green and I smiled in a coy, slightly subtle yet purposeful way. Dinner was delightful, timed to perfection and embodies the organic qualities that I have sought since my first day in Chicago., 'I have been to North Pond three times now - twice for drinks and once for dinner. I would say that it is one of the must -try places for people who live in Chicago, simply because of the history and location. The restaurant is beautiful and very elegant. There a great view of the skyline and the pond out front. Try to get a table in the front room if at all possible. The one thing I would really commend this restaurant on is their attention to detail and customer service. I went there with my family for my graduation dinner. After we were seated we noticed that the hostess hadn given us menus, which we thought was a bit odd. A few minutes later, our server finally came out with menus and we opened them up we saw that they had been custom-printed to say Congratulations Lindsey. I thought that this was a really nice touch. Naturally, I wanted to save one as a memento, but it wasn going to fit in my purse. No need to worry - the server came back with all of the menus in a special envelope so they wouldn get bent without my even asking. They also have a cute little bar up front that I like to come to on occasion, but beware the drinks are REALLY expensive and REALLY strong.', 'I love the atmosphere in this place, but I don think the food is as excellent as I like it to be. My husband, father and I went there for my husband birthday this year and went there a few years ago for something special (can remember what). It is a truly unique place in that you don get to feel like youe tucked away in a special parky place in the city very often. At the same time that you feel like youe gotten away from it all, there are some nice city views from there, so you can appreciate this wonderful city that we all live in. Plus, historically, it an interesting building and the design is charles rene mackintosh (sp?) inspired.The staff there was great when we were there in June. I let them know ahead of time that it was my husband birthday and they gave us special menus with Happy Birthday Andrew!! typed across the menu. It was so cute and such a special little touch that was not expected. We all really got a kick out of it. So what didn I like? I didn think the food was all that. It was good enough (certainly not so bad that it ruined our night or anything), but it was not as pectacular as I like -- especially since it is, as so many have mentioned, more expensive than average. I can see that I not the only one who thinks this, which is helpful to know, since I can never tell if it just me (because I a vegetarian and don always get the main fare at a place) or not. In short, if you want a special location to go to, do go here (if you have the cash for it). You will get interesting food and a great atmosphere, but you won get mind-blowing food. However, if youe looking for really, really good food, or inexpensive fare, I would not recommend this place.', I've been looking for a romantic restaurant for my BF and I to celebrate our anniversary so we decided on North Pond. The past reviews by other Yelpers were very accurate:* Atmosphere: The Chicago skyline behind the pond was beautiful. It was a little foggy but I can't pin that against the restaurant. The decor of the restaurant was very soothing, not too stuffy, very intimate and comfortable.* Food: For what we paid, the food wasn't that great. My BF has the sirloin which was pretty good. I had the SeaBass with scallops which I wasn't very fond off. Too fishy and salty for me. The dessert was amazing though, very delicous* Details: I loved their attention to detail, the dessert place and the menu had a note to us celebrating the special occassionI probably won't come back for seconds, but it definitely is a place you need to try at least once., 'you can not go wrong here. no matter who you are dining with, this is the perfect place. i was told a long time ago that this was an old ice-skate rental house for the park district. you definitely feel the history of old chicago when you enter the quaint space. the fireplace is fantastic as are the views of lincoln park and the chicago skyline. ie had both lunch and dinner here and thoroughly enjoyed whatever i had. everyone ie dined with here has the same reaction i have which is, will it ever become socially acceptable to lick the sauce off of your plate?', i'm having a bit of a fit right now about overly styled food. you know exactly what i am talking about and you know how dated it is: little piles of parts of your dinner scattered about the plate, seemingly at random (but really highly strategized and debated); great swaths of sauce careening around, but missing the food altogether; perhaps an architectural stack of something towering over the cowering piles... it's just too much. too precious, too calculated, too artsy. the 1980's called and they want their food back! north pond falls prey to this out-dated trend with their plating. unfortunately.fortunately, that is the only flaw i can find in this otherwise perfect place. the focus is on local, seasonal, organic ingredients and the combinations are often spectacular. the menu featured appropriately rich, comforting, homey foods for mid-february. gingerbread encrusted venison and fabulous steak, mashed celery root, roasted tri-color beets, slow-roasted oxtail, and on and on. this brings me back, somewhat obsessively, to my problem with frou-frou plating: this type of food looks a little silly arranged in quasi-delicate stacks and drizzled with lacy sauces. like a line backer crammed into a tutu. ok, sorry. back to all of the wonderful aspects of the dinner...the ambiance is unique and charming. set in lincoln park, accessible only by a foot path, and done in perfect arts and crafts detail, this is truly a special occasion destination. plan a birthday, anniversary or other celebration at north pond., I recommend North Pond to everyone that wants a great American meal with fresh regional foods. Chef Bruce Sherman is a master and the room designed by my friend Nancy Warren is so inviting. I think this is up there as possibly the most romantic restaurant in Chicago. I love it in the summer and winter equally. The food and service is always perfect. I'm not kidding. This is a real find in Lincoln Park and so worth every cent., Requested a table by the window and couldn't have been happier with the table, decor, ambiance.This restaurant seems to be very conservation-minded, with a lot of locally grown produce, sustainable foods, even the booze seemed predominantly organic.Heavy on bacon and pork flavoring, so not super vegetarian-friendly. I did have an asparagus soup with a lemony goat chesse souffle and the over-all effect was bland. For my entree a fish I had never heard of, berramunde(?) served with the skin on and I really disliked it. The fish was pedestrian at best. My husband enjoyed everything he ordered(he had lingering bacon taste even after we got home), so maybe I didn't order right. I loved this space and like the idea of it, but wouldn't return to eat. I would, however go to the bar to enjoy the spectacular view and thoughtfully stocked bar., 'Go. There is nothing here to disappoint you. The food, decor, service is stellar.', 'Absolutely awesome location in Lincoln Park (the park, not the neighborhood!). The setting was intimate but not too formal, and the wine list was great. This Florida boy was not overly inspired by the seafood, but it was still very good. I would give this place a 5 star for location, and a 4 star for food, with that 4 star rating taking into account the relative priciness of the entrees.', Thanks to fellow Yelpers I was pointed in the direction of North Pond for a very special dinner where...The Parents Meet the day before the wedding...for the first time...This is definitely a spot you should consider for a very very special and fancy event because A. It is very very expensiveB. It is sooooo beautiful!!!! -So beautiful, that you wouldn't want to waste it on something ordinary.We were lucky because it was such a nice spring day and we got there early as the sun set over the city..breathtaking. The architecture itself inside was amazing also.The food was gourmet and fresh and delicious.I am lucky because everyone I was with didn't mind sharing.My personal favorites of the night were the asparagus soup and the various handmade ice creams!! The fish was also cooked to perfection.My only complaint was that it got kind of loud, and since we were at a large round table, it was difficult to hear everyone as the dinner wore on...But, everyone around the table enjoyed this experience, as it isn't everyday that we all meet for the first time for such a joyous occasion, in addition to being able to eat and such a elegant restaurant., 'Gorgeous, amazing food. The chef and model of restaurant utilizes local producers and are genuinely concerned with fresh food. Beautiful setting to dine, no matter where you are seated.', Excellent 3 course prix fixe Father's Day brunch. Really the enjoyed the poached egg and pork tenderloin on creamy grits for starter. Halibut and hanger steak entrees were nicely done. Nice presentation to desserts. Great view of the Chicago skyline overlooking the pond. Minus one star for cold yet professional service., OVER-PRICED AND STUFFY! I'm not sure what all the rave reviews are based on for this place, but in my opinion the location is the best thing about it. We went there for a birthday celebration and it was a nice touch that the menu included the person's name on it. (but they are printed daily, so really, not that big of a whoop). We were made to wait for over 35 minutes for our 9pm reservation, then seated and waited on by people who were in no particular hurry and had major attitudes. Cold and stuffy is how I would describe it. We did the 5 or 6 course tasting menu which was good, but the portions were too small for my boyfriend and the only reason we were full at the end was all the bread we filled up on during the 25 min intervals between courses. While most items were creative and fairly delicious, I would in no way say this is a good bet in a city which boasts so many amazing restaurants. I was fairly disappointed for the most part, and even more so when the check came to over $320 for two - whaaat? Go to Spiaggia or Everest for amazing views for that kind of price tag, where the food (and service!) is far superior., I've been here only once, for brunch, and I can't wait to go back for dinner. Such an eclectic and original menu of updated breakfast favorites should be celebrated!, North Pond is THE place for special occasion dining (or extraordinary splurge). Our 20th anniversary was the setting. Beautiful rain storm outside with the happy ducks adding to the already fantastic setting.Waiters and busboys hovering (maybe alittle too much), and there might have been too many waiters coming to the table. The wine steward, the order taker, and the food runner, and then the dessert menu. It was ok, though, as everything was superb. Our fancy dessert had Happy anniversary in chocolate on the rim. Couldn't ask for a better evening., I would like to go back to this place. I went for my birthday dinner and I just flew back from Europe on that day, so I wasn't too much into eating and staying out late. But food was great, I enjoyed it no matter the jet lag. I had the tasting menu and everything was fantastic. Service was very good too, so overall we had a great experience. Location is nice too, 'a little salty but very sweet. I, of course appreciate the dedication to local and organic produce that the entrees are prepared with, and the menu is on a seasonal rotation. Not much in the way of wine under 40/bottle but they had a great pinot from oregon. Must try the hen and steak appetizer!!!.... better get there before the fall menu kicks in though. I would try and get seated in the window-o-plenty area of the dinning room, great view of the park and pond, really a great atmosphere overall. Its was nice to take a ten minute walk through the park from the bus stop. I think they have a brunch too that I have always wanted to try.', 'It is definitely expensive, but it has one of the best tucked away romantic locations in the City and undoubtedly some of the best food. The tastes and service you will get here will completely blow your socks off. The food is delicious without being pretentious and the whole experience is worth the splurge every so often! This is the place to go for a special night out.', This review is for the brunch. It's a fixed price ($32), and you order from the server. There are three choices for every course, and three courses--appetizer, main, and dessert. Although this is gourmet dining, I was not overly impressed with the selections. I feel as though they might take some shortcuts because of the beauty of the location. I'd never had an amuse bousch for brunch, and for good reason----it was a teeny piece of coffee cake! What's the point? Also, there is a dessert course--at 11 am I am not thinking I want dessert. In general, the location, especially in the fall, is as good as it gets! But the brunch is kind of...weird, and not for everyone--which, for a restaurant whose location is perfect for an autumn family brunch is unfortunate. I would be happier if they offered a standard brunch/breakfast menu, keeping the fixed price menu for dinner. (Lula, for example, offers more unusual selections but also offers standard breakfast,/brunch fare like eggs benedict, and they keep everyone happy that way!), 'For our 6-month wedding anniversary (yeah I know, but it only comes once!) I told my husband to chose a place for brunch or dinner and suprise me, but to try to keep it under $100 for food and drink. Sunday morning he told me we were going to North Pond for brunch and based on all the rave reveiws, I was really excited. It a darling little place with a great view of the city. We arrived early so we sat at the bar and had a drink - a mimosa for him and a spiced pear for me. The pear drink was fantastic, though our bartender made me a bit uncomfortable. She was very quiet, almost timid to the point where I felt like I was being loud just talking in a normal voice. We moved over to our table and our waiter was the same way. Flat, quiet, he almost seemed...medicated. Throughout our meal we noticed the other servers, food runners and bus boys were all the same. I appreciate professional, non-intrusive service, but I also appreciate a bit of personality. Lighten up - it brunch!They wrote happy anniversay Dan and Katie on our menus, and gave us copies to keep which was a nice touch. We started with another round of mimosas and asked how the pacing of the courses was. Since this was our big anniversary brunch we didn want it to be over immediately. Our waiter said it was a good pace. Since that was an entirely not helpful answer, my husband told him that we wanted to take our time, not having the next course come out immediately when we were done with the first, maybe wait 5 minutes. Since he was starving Dan also asked if there was a bread basket or anything we could start on. Our waiter said there was no actual basket but after we placed out order we would get scones. We got one small scone, though it was tasty. I started with the butternut squash soup with goat cheese. It was fantastic, nice and creamy and the goat cheese gave it a little something extra. Dan had the sausage, egg which was sausage on a bed of creamy polenta topped with a poached egg. He liked it but I didn care for it. We then moved on to a bottle of prosecco. After it was poured the waiter took the bottle away and came back periodlically to refill our glasses. At first I though it was a bit annoying as a few times I had to wait for a refill, but it helped us make the bottle last for the rest of the meal, so it worked to our benefit. We waited about 20 minutes for our next course. After 10 minutes they brought out a small plate of the peeky toe crab salad which was suprisingly good. I not sure if everyone got that, or if it was because our food was taking a while. For the next course I had the hangar steak (perfectly cooked medium rare, tender, juicy and served with a nice sauce) with kale and barley (eh). Dan had the french toast with pheasant and cranberries. He asked about the pheasant - was it a breast? The waiter said it was pulled pheasant. It came out as a breast, which was fine but showed that our waiter didn know the menu that well. The french toast was wonderful, soaked in syrup and the pheasant was tender and had a great flavor as well. For dessert Dan had the pumpkin cream and I had the mint and chocolate cookie. The pumpkin cream was a layer of mousse topped by spice cake topped by whipped cream. It would have been fantastic had there just been more cake. Once it was gone, it was just plain pumpkin mousse. My mint cookie was dissapointing. It was a block of ice cream - mint on one side and chocolate on the other, topped with a bit of whipped cream. The cookie was only present where the two ice creams met. The portions were the perfect size - small by some standards (ridiculously huge restaurant portions) but actually the correct size for a healthy meal. The bowl of soup was big, but the hangar steak portion was probably about 3 ounces and the desserts would be called mini in most restaurants. It was perfectly enough - we left satisfied, not hungry but not stuffed. Also I was suprised, given that jackets are required for dinner, to find people at brunch in jeans and sneakers. Brunch is a more casual affair but I still thought some level of formality was expected. I had thought about wearing a fancier dress (I ended up in a wool long -sleeved dress with tights and cute shoes) and I am glad I didn - I would have felt over-dressed. Overall, I though the food was GOOD - good, quality ingredients, simple food prepared well - but it wasn spectacular. I think the food was definately worth the price of $32 each for 3 courses, but I think they overcharged on the alcohol. $75 of our bill was for a bottle of processeco and 4 drinks. At first I thought I might come back and try dinner, but not if dinner would put us out $300. Based on the food I had for brunch I just don think it would be quite worth it.', I wish I could give this place 4 stars, but I feel that my experience was good, but not at the level of some of my other 4 star reviews. Service was excellent, ambiance was excellent the food was good, not what was expected. The menu is comprised of creative and seasonal dishes (as it should be) from a James Beard award-winning chef.We were visiting for the weekend from LA and made an advance reservation. The address listed is not really the correct address, as it puts you onto the backside of the restaurant, which normally wouldn't be an issue, but we were navigating a rental car through snow and ice, so that left us a little baffled. We parked on the street and trudged through mud, snow and ice to get to the front door. My suggestion if you don't know the driveway would be to call the restaurant for an alternate address.Once inside, you feel as if in a contemporary Colorado ski lodge. On a spring or summer day or evening, I'm sure the views out onto the lake are beautiful. We sat in the main dining room with a nice front row seat to the open kitchen. Controlled chaos was dying down as we had a late 9:30 reservation. We started with squash, black truffle and walnut soup. I saw the truffles, but couldn't taste or smell them in the dish. When asking our server if there were truffles in the soup, she looked quite shocked and confirmed the presence of the truffles. Hmmm.... I've tasted truffles before, and i'm not quite sure how my taste buds could miss that one.In trying to put the mystery of the tasteless truffle aside and enjoy the remainder of our meal, we moved onto main courses. Tobin with a steak and me with sturgeon. My fish was very enjoyable with inventive touches and lots of different flavors including pomegranate and leeks and yummy pork belly...salty and sweet, best of both worlds. The fish was cooked perfectly, moist in the center with a little crispy flakiness on the outside. Tobin's steak was good, nothing to write home about. Dessert was two eclairs, one with pumpkin creme, the other pomegranate caramel. I took one bite each and was then done. Overall, this was a nice experience, but maybe by being spoiled with great, fresh west coast cuisine, i wasn't blown away like i should have been. Have i grown too spoiled?, My husband and I went here to celebrate a big promotion, and north pond made everything so special! They customized our menus with our names, decorated our plates with congratulations written in chocolate and a few other special things to make everything a bit nicer. We had the chef's tasting menu with the wine pairings, and couldn't have been happier with the selections. The food here was delicious (so fresh and creative), the service was excellent, and we would love to return., chose north pond for our 1 yr anniversary dinner. notable first course was perch, sorrel, which was impeccable if i might use such an adjective to describe food. the execution of the dish was first rate and flavors were extremely fresh; their attention to detail in presentation should be commended too. for the main course...my wife had the strip steak w. veggies, I chose the wild pheasant. again, both very well prepared and tasted great. overall a good and memorable experience. only complaint would be not being able to sit in the 'room w. a view' and frankly that's perhaps a bigger draw than the food itself, esp when doing a special night out. It would appear you need to get in early for the first seating or just luck out for the second seating and thereafter. 3/5 overall, 4/5 for the food., My boyfriend and I enjoyed brunch at North Pond today to celebrate my birthday. Brunch at Northpond is a 3-course meal for $32.00, which I think is a pretty good deal. For my appetizer, I had cauliflower and apple soup with lump crab and grapefruit salad. It was incredible. Brian had a salad with pomegranate and meyer lemons.For my entree I had goat cheese strada with olive tapenade, frisee salad and shaved parm. It was outstanding. B had trout with olive oil poached fingerlings and capers? This course really stood out for both of us.Finally, we ended with dessert. I had caramelized bananas, chocolate mousse, and some kind of 3 layer chocolate, espresso, banana goodness. Brian had a blood orange trifle? Both were very good.Overall, we had a fantastic experience and loved everything we ate. We'll definitely be back!, I didn't really know much about North Pond before I came here for dinner in late summer, but the ambiance alone had won me over before I even glanced at a menu.What a gorgeous setting in Lincoln Park with a view of the beautiful skyline, yet tucked away so you feel like you are on a retreat! The inside feels like a cozy, elegant cabin, and I love any restaurant and chef committed to sustainable agriculture so I was very excited for my meal.The food and wine were wonderful -not 5 stars wonderful, but satisfying nonetheless. I highly recommend asking questions to your servers; they know their stuff, or at least ours did. Had two great fish dishes, and dessert paired with a little Muscato was the perfect finish!Walking out by the pond as the sun was setting was probably as enjoyable as the meal itself. I'd love to come back and try the seasonal tasting menu!, 'We went here for brunch, which at $32 a person was an excellent deal in relation to the prices on the dinner menu. The food was really really good, I had the sausage and egg appetizer, the steak entree (which came with brussels sprouts that were not only edible, they were delicious) and the orange cream dessert. Everything looked and tasted great and the portions were perfect. The servers were pleasant and unobtrusive. The decor is lovely, all woodsy and arts and crafts. The reason that theye not getting the fifth star, however, is that for this kind of money I should be saying Oh my god, that was awesome, I can wait to go back! Which I not. It was good, but I can get a good brunch for half the price somewhere else. This is a nice place for a special occasion, not for your average Sunday brunch.By the way, if you do go for brunch, jeans are acceptable attire.', A couple of friends and I have a tradition of doing a splurge meal around the holidays, and this last year we opted for the seasonal tasting menu at North Pond. Looking across the pond has long been one of my favorite views of the skyline from Lincoln Park; unfortunately for our meal, we were seated along the side, so no views for us, but we had plenty to keep us busy with the courses and the wine pairings; I don't have the menu in front of me, but we were quite impressed: well prepared, well paired, and nice use of seasonal/local ingredients as per their philosophy. The interior is quite charming, arts & crafts and with integration of local elements. Our server was excellent, friendly and knowledgeable but not too familiar. I will definitely go back as soon as I can find another reason - and enough cash - for a bit of a splurge. I think the brunch might be a good way to tide over, based on other reviews ...., 'The view is excellent. When eating here during the summer, the accordion doors are folded back and the dining room opens to the lake, which is within the park. From beyond the trees, in the background, the city sits, and pre-war mid-rises are in your periphery. It is a true sense of serenity inside the city. The decor in the restaurant is Frank Lloyd Wright inspired and quite detailed, with quotes of literary fame. The service is impeccable and the attention to detail is exquisite. The food is completely seasonal, and changes are made often. The chef speaks of the importance of eating seasonal, organic foods, and you will also realize that these foods are at their optimum flavor while in season too. The food here is more flavorful, more well defined and far above the rest. The tastes are well captured and paired in a way that is rarely seen. With every detail in place, North Pond truly enlivens the diner.', Wonderful place for a special occassion dinner.We went here to celebrate our anniversary and it was really a wonderful evening. They printed a happy anniversary message with our names on the menus, the server wished us a happy anniversary, the dessert plate was customized with a message and our names in solidified chocolate... they did some prep work to ensure that they recognized that we were celebrating. All these little extra efforts were really nice.The service was wonderful. There when you needed something... visible (they didn't disappear for extended periods of time)... helpful if you have questions... friendly without being over the top or fake... not pretentious. Actually the whole place was non-pretentious which is also really nice considering that it is on the pricier end. The food was really excellent. I love the seasonality and the thought that is put into the menu. Everything on the menu looked wonderful and we completely enjoyed the items that we ordered. The tasting option was a bit pricy- we orded a first, an entree, and shared dessert and were completely satisfied.The atmosphere is quite cozy and really lovely. I had high expectations as I had wanted to see the interior for a long time and it did not disappoint. They only thing that could have been better is if we had a seat by the windows... next time!We overall were completely happy with the evening. This is a fantastic place for a special occassion or really even just a nice evening out. It would also be a wonderful place to take the parents when they visit. I definitely want to go back and try a different season's menu or maybe try brunch., I went here for my birthday dinner and what an occassion it was! I asked if I might bring a cake and they happily obliged, though they charged $4/slice, but really not bad considering their desserts averaged $10. When it was served, the pastry chef had written Happy Birthday Lauren in chocolate around the rims of the plates. Even the menus were specially printed with a birthday greeting, impressing us all. As to the food, it was simply amazing. The freshest, most unique but not offsetting combinations like the oxtail-butternut squash ravioi appetizer were melt-in-your mouth a few times once over. I feel like I'm gushing, but honestly this is a hidden little jewel of Chicago. The venison was also delicious, cooked pefectly, full of flavor. A wonderful, wonderful experience in all., There are so many things I love about this restaurant. Obviously the food is the main attraction. I've been lucky enough to dine here more than once and it's been consistently delicious. I also enjoy the design and location. North Pond is housed in what was formerly a warming shelter for skaters. While all traces of its former use are gone, the warmth within the four walls still remains. With its simple and elegant Arts & Crafts design, North Pond oozes charm and comfort. And the view is quite lovely.A few more items that make North Pond exceptional: its efforts to provide sustainable cuisine by partnering with local farmers whenever possible as well as its support of local charities like Deborah's Place (who works to provide homeless women with shelter and support), the North Pond Conservation Council (and organization that partners with the Chicago Park District in the management of the North Pond Nature Sanctuary), and the Chef's Council (which supports sustainable cuisine). They also promote a Charity of the Month in their newsletter. Unlike a lot of restaurants in Chicago, they work hard to be a good community partner and a good neighbor., Yes- North Pond is soooo romantic and nice! It is at 2600-ish North Cannon Drive, just north of the Peggy Notebart museum and Lincoln Park Zoo. It is a building right in the middle of Lincoln Park that was originally built to be a warming house for ice skaters in Lincoln Park. It was re-done in the very-Frank-Lloyd-Wright-prairie-style a few years ago. The menu changes daily and is entirely organic fruits, vegetables and meat products. It is not the best for the vegetarians (in the winter/early spring season)- there is a lot of duck, veal, pork and beef- but it is organic, so you don't feel so bad about eating meat... If you're still vegetarian and looking to go- I would recommend going in the summer when there would be more fruit/vegetable options. All their menu comes from local sources- they even list where each beverage is brewed and guarantee that all their ingredients are from local farmers.We had a really nice dinner and felt really special when they brought out the customized menu and dessert plate! (When you make the reservation- and you MUST make a reservation- they ask you if it is a special occasion- that's how they must've known to do all that for us)For all of this- it is a bit pricey, but really not that bad! Our appetizers were between 10 -18 (I got the foie gras at 18). Our bottle of wine was not the best, but incredibly tasty at 60. Our entrees were 30- 35.I highly recommend it and would certainly go back for our next special occasion or to impress out-of-town guests., Beautiful restaurant and amazing food. The wine list was also very impressive. Our server was very nice and attentive. There is a nice bar to wait in , and you must try a speciality cocktail. The food is all seasonal which I loved. The view is very impressive. Great for a special occasion or to take friends from out of town. And very romanitc.Can't wait to go back!, 'Absolute Disappointment.It was my mom birthday and somebody recommended this place. I called a day before and made a reservation for 7 people. It was the D-day and 3 hours before the reserved time, they called. Umm, sorry, but the girl who took your call yesterday did not inform you that only course meals can be served for a party of 3 or more. 4-course meal is $77 and 5-course meal is blah, blah, blah.... Obviously I was upset and wanted to hear no more.All they could say was sorry.Well, Sorry North Pond Cafe, I don know how nice and important you are, but you surely suck at training your staff. You completely ruined an important day of my life, wasted my time and energy.You completely lost a good reviewer and anyone I know as clients. Bye bye.', 'I really wanted to be able to give North Pond a glowing review, but overall I was pretty disappointed with the whole experience. My boyfriend and I went for dinner to celebrate our anniversary. North Pond has been on my must try for a special occasion list for a long time and I was really excited for a phenomenal meal. But it was just ok. On the whole, I thought most of my food was over-salted. I had the Sweet Shrimp with Parmesan Consume that basically tasted like salt. And my halibut dish was undercooked and heavily salted. The best part of the meal was the dessert. It was a blueberry pastry with different ice creams and sour cream on top. It was complex, creative and unique - I wish everything else had lived up to the dessert. The service also left much to be desired. Our waiter never checked back to see how the food was and it took a long time to order. And don get me wrong, we weren in a hurry at all. I can fully appreciate the beauty of slow food but there a difference between enjoying your food and neglect. Plus he got my order totally wrong and brought out a completely different dish than what I had ordered. They did take my boyfriend dinner back to be warmed while they made mine, but he said it tasted better when they brought it out the first time. The atmosphere and location are very lovely. I consider going back for brunch and giving it a try, but if I going to spend that much money on dinner, I want it to be amazing.', Sublime, amazing and unbelievable this could be the best restaurant in Chicago. Chef Sherman combines unique, fresh produce with other distinct ingredients to make flavors come alive. He does things to beets which could be illegal they taste so sinfully good. The service is great and I have not had a bad meal yet. Go for brunch if you want to try the menu but save a few bucks. If you want to splurge for the seasonal tasting menu with the wine pairings. It's well worth it., I had brunch here the other weekend. It was SO good!!!! It was a 4 course brunch/lunch and we got a nice seat near the window. I had a blueberry tart, french toast with bacon, frittata, and chocolate Mouse. The price was a fixed 35 dollar deal but for a fancy lunch, not too bad at all. I think it's a great place to celebrate your birthday or anniversary., we just returned home from such a wonderful sunday brunch experience here. it is a three course menu, $32, not including drinks. each of the courses offers four selections. for starters, i ordered a bloody mary, which was o.k., and the hub ordered a blueberry vodka concoction, which i didn't care for, its vanilla taste threw me.but the food courses!! first, they tease your palate with the smallest square of moist blueberry breakfast cake before they bring on the big guns. hub's french toast with berries and bacon and my poached egg on a bed of creamy seafood, with a dice of green and yellow beans and squash, accented with caviar, were both luscious, each in their own sweet/savory way. my second course of salmon on polenta with squash and red pepper/tomato garnish, and his of steak with potatoes, corn, and tiny onion rings, were spot on, and the third course desserts, his, a chocolate mousse layered with raspberry and mine, a nectarine blueberry tart with blueberry sorbet, offered a perfect amen. and the coffee is served up aromatic, dark, and strong, like we like it.i like that the flavors are so distinct, the fact that i know the vegetables used are as fresh as can be, and that the portions are just the right size to fill you up, but not overly so. the server was really pleasant, and the rest of the serving staff slip in and out, silently, like food ninjas.the interior offers up different environments, depending on where you're placed. we were in the outer dining area, light, with floor to ceiling windows, with the park and lagoon serving as a perfect backdrop on a gorgeous day. the interior room, by contrast, was dimly lit, one of those places where you can't be quite sure of the time of day. it's a cloistered environment, one i imagine would feel really cozy in the winter time. the wooden appointments throughout are beautifully rendered in an arts and crafts motif. upended wooden parasols serve as light fixtures, the ceiling is layered screenwork offering up interesting moire patterns that mimic the grain of the wood in the walls and trim. a really beautiful place to let your eyes wander and appreciate. it's especially impressive considering how it used to exist years ago when we'd frequent it as a skating shelter!all in all, a great dining treat., Certain events combine to create the perfect evening. Our visit on August 30th fits into that category; great food, perfect weather, great table, great friends, and cool bartenders. We got there 45 minutes early to enjoy the great bar and the great view. Tom and Shannon were extremely good mixologists. Great discussions about certain kinds of gin and vodka. Free samples of certain items offered up. And the wives got to flirt a little with them since they were so nice and cute.From start (Farm Egg with Bacon) to middle (Guinea Hen with Peas) to the dessert (oops, I forgot). Everything had the 'oh my god' affect on you as you tasted it.We ended up dropping about $250 a couple, which set a personal record, but was truly worth it. I imagine under different circumstances a couple could do the evening for 1/2 that amount, if you forego the expensive bottle of wine and desserts. This ranks up there with the best meals ever in Chicago. We will go back as soon as my bank account recovers., So we hit up North Pond on a Saturday night and I must say, it did not disappoint. Reading previous reviews about the service, I had a keen eye out for any lapses. None to be seen! The host was nice and our server was very friendly and attentive, but not too much. First course, I went for the corn chowder w/ trout....extremely smooth and delicious. I was close to licking the bowl. My wife had the beet and goat cheese salad. This consisted of 5 different kinds of beets and a mint flavored goat cheese. She loved it...though, she also loves beets! She thought the goat cheese was a great balance to the different flavored and textured beets. We then split the foie gras. By itself, it was foie gras...but with everything combined-foie gras, french toast, plums, sauteed onion and granola it was an explosion of taste!The bass with mushrooms was excellent. It had a medley of sweet corn, new potatoes, bacon and this great green chive cream. The wife loved her pork loin w/ apricots, which was done perfectly. Wish I could tell you about dessert, but we were stuffed! Highly recommend this place for a cozy escape from the city. I always feel like we're at a fancy hunting/fishing lodge up north when visiting this spot., Absolutely fantastic, unusual, creative, wonderful food. Great setting, and terrific service. Fun to watch the operations in the open kitchen. And, as far as I'm concerned, the only reason to revisit Chicago. Arctic Char was sublime, lettuce/radish salad with some macaroon thing out of this world, and the desserts exquisite., If you enjoy fine dining but don't enjoy the giant credit card bill afterwards, this place is for you. The cuisine and service are top notch and the menu is changed four times throughout the year (one for each season).The decor and view are great. Nice wood interior with a great view of the, you guessed it, north pond. If you attend on a special occasion they'll print a special menu for you. Definitely worth a trip for any food lover., 'Arts and crafts era decor makes for a comfortably elegant experience.Simple yet decadent.I had the grass-fed steak, smelt (a tasty first for me), and tried an ice wine (late harvest), among other things.Our waitress was exuberantly knowledgeable about the menu and the courses were prompt, not rushed. In sum, it was an adventurous night for my taste buds.', We came across this place while out walking. Sundays we take the red line north then walk back to the city for fun, yes really! Anyway this time we got off a bit further and came across North Pond which looked like a great place to eat especially for the architecture, view and location.The Sunday brunch didn't start well. I hate to be kept waiting. We got there about 9:45 I think and it didn't open till 10am or something like that. Anyway we got there before it opened which isn't a biggie so we walked around for a bit then walked in when the time came.Now if you say you are open at time X then I expect to be in and seated and perusing the menu within a minute or two of that time. They kept us sitting in the bloody lobby for 20-25 minutes which is totally unacceptable. I mean it's not as if their opening time varies you open and should be ready at that time not piss off customers who are hungry. At minimum they should have served complimentary coffee of something.Anyway we got sat down about 30 minutes after we arrived and I noticed then that the dress code was relaxed for brunch. This sucks and they should state on their outside menu that the no jeans policy does not apply for brunch. Luckily I had cords on so no biggie but it would have seriously annoyed me if I turned up all posh to find other types in jeans. Things got better after we sat down although it still took us a good 10 minutes before our server came over but once the orders started things started to get better. I didn't know what to expect so I didn't realise the brunch was a 3 course set price affair at about $35. I didn't see their brunch menu on the window when I walked past so this was a bit of a surprise. Ultimately it was worth it though as it was a lovely experiece and the food was great. Lots of interesting flavours, textures and intensities spread out over an hour or so. Of course we couldn't get a glass of champagne till after 11am, its kind of a stupid law to be honest, I mean I can see why perhaps you might have a law like that in liquor stores but not a restaurant. I would have given them 5/5 but they lose a star for messing me about when I arrived. I would recommend this place and they also take reservations for Brunch, we didn't have reservations but were the first people there. It was quite empty till 11:15-11:30 so dont feel you need to get there at 10 when we arrived., 'I really do enjoy this place - from the interior to the food.....The interior is very Frank Lloyd Wright-esque, and is spacious but manages to feel very homey as well. There are comfy booths, fireplaces, tables, and a slate-tiled bathroom which is as pretty as it is warm (nice on a cold day). The view of the pond is spectacular, and its proximity to said pond makes sense since the restaurant used to be a warming shelter for ice-skaters back in the early 1900s.The food is made using produce from local farmers, and the menu is seasonal, changing about four times a year. You will never have a meal that isn fresh, with all of the ingredients harvested at the most opportune time of the year.My most recent experience began with a charismatic waiter who was as thorough as he was charming. Since I can (gasp) be a bit of a picky eater, the fact he didn make as much fun of me as the rest of my table was much appreciated. The waiter was knowledgeable about every dish on the menu, as well as all of the drinks, what would taste good with each course, etc.We all started with salads and soups - I had the Kampachi & apple salad, and the rest of the table had the fennel and grapes salad and two bowls of scallop and squash soup. For the main courses, I had the root vegetables & figs, which was correctly described by the server as about 100 tastes in one. It was great! In addition, we had swordfish & suncake, which was mouth-watering, squab & huckleberry (squab described as tasting similar to beef), and lobster & chicken.To discuss the deliciousness of the food seems kind of unnecessary, because it all was wonderful. By dessert, we were all full, but all managed to order just one more thing each. I had the grapes & yogurt, which was absolutely amazing and melt-in-your mouth. I don usually like desserts, but couldn help myself - I wanted to lick my bowl clean. Also outstanding - the pumpkin & ginger, the fig & corn (ordered to taste what cornbread ice cream was like), and the chocolate & pine nut.If you appreciate good food and want a great experience, this is a must-visit.', 'My husband took me to North Pond last Friday for my birthday and it was a truly special treat. I am from the San Francisco Bay Area, home to Alice Waters and Chez Panisse, French Laundry, etc. So I have a particularly critical palette. I was totally impressed by each dish. My main dish was called Goat, Squash and paired the most amazing meat with sweet maple butternut squash cubes and golden raisins. Also on the plate was goat shank on a bed of green herbs - very Springy. The service was attentive and respectful and the atmosphere is beautiful. Bravo! This is the perfect spot for a celebration.', I went here about a year and a half ago and haven't had a better meal before or since. The ambience is incredibly peaceful and romantic and the wait-staff is unparalleled in their timing and professionalism. I can't remember our server's name but she was the most knowledgeable and caring server I've ever had. She was so personally invested in us having a great first-wedding-anniversary that we felt like she was having us over to her home rather than a restaurant., When my Dad and stepmom (who's a foodie) came to town I knew North Pond would be the perfect place to take them. This was my first time there. The atmosphere is rustic chic and very welcoming. The bar is great (albeit too warm in there) and the front room has a fireplace and overlooked a pond and had a nice view of the city. The restaurant showcases high-end spirits and a great wine list. The food is expertly prepared. I started with the the fennel salad with quince. It was outstanding. Then I moved on to the grass-fed beef with beets as my main dish. The beef was okay but the beets were the most delicious ones I have ever had. The rutabaga was yummy as well. What makes North Pond special is the unique combination of flavors they have in their food. Clearly, it's a well thought-out menu that is all about showcasing food and promoting food appreciation / enjoyment.I wish I could say the service was excellent but it wasn't. The woman who waited on us (ponytail, glasses) took 10 minutes to show up to our table from the time we sat down. I was surprised that it took her that long. And when she did show up at the table she only handed us the menus and walked off. No welcome, no nothing. I wish I could say she was friendly but she had an attitude. The other waitstaff was extremely attentive (water guy and the guy who brought the amuse-bouche). If I go back I will specifically request not to sit in her section.The night we were there it was pouring down rain. Since the restaurant is set back from the road, I thought it would be a nice touch for the restaurant to have someone standing at the street with an umbrella to welcome diners or at least escort them to the front door of the restaurant. I think it would be a nice touch if they would offer this., 'My boyfriend took me here over a year ago for my birthday, Ie never noticed this place before until that day. It has a beautiful view of the city and overlooks a. . . pond (I suppose). The inside is very rustic and fits the whole game theme that goes with their menu. Speaking of menu - mine had Happy Birthday Mildred at the top of it :)The food was delicious, I honestly don remember what I had and I can find the menu. I have never come across a restaurant with these flavors and selection. They had the best dessert ie ever had - which was a pumpkin/pomagranate combination (who would have thought!). And the chef also sent an extra dish to us on the house. If I had more money, I would definitely come here more often. The service wasn great and the rest of the crowd was kinda looking our way a lot. I think we were the youngest people (and least dressed up people - i mean we were in business casual attire) who dined there that night. the person who takes away our plates was angry or something and when we said thank you he would just stare at us.', I've been to North Pond twice. The first time I went, I thought it was pretty good. I remembered thinking it was really cute that the berries on my plate came from the tree right outside the window, and I liked that we were able to bring our own wine for dinner. All-in-all, a good dinner. However, the second time we came I was so disappointed. When I made the reservation I asked to be seated at a nice table since we were celebrating my first wedding anniversary and father's day simultaneously, but we got the worst table ever. It was really cramped and in a really busy area and so my chair kept getting hit whenever anyone walked by. It was such a tight squeeze that even the waitstaff had trouble maneuvering around the table. The food was also not very good and was totally unmemorable. The only thing I remember was that many dishes were bland and off in texture. So, from my own experiences I would say that North Pond is very inconsistent and that there is an equal possibility of having a good dinner or a bad dinner.|1
39|octavia-san-francisco|'Fabulous creative menu and a wine program that is diverse, eclectic and inclusive of both old and new world selections. Ambiance is lovely and unrecognizable from its former incarnations. We were here for a soft-opening dinner and were blown away. We started with aromatic vermouth-based drinks which were delicate and refreshing. Big fans of Frances, we weren surprised that chef Melissa Perello has pulled off a superb selection/curation of dishes including a deviled egg like no other with Fresno chile and Marash pepper, mushrooms a la Grecque with grilled levain which were fantastic, spring vegetable salad with both dill and cilantro accents, grilled asparagus with miso and burnt shallot, and quail with roasted spring onions. There were other very tempting dishes but we will have to return soon to experience them!As long time SF residents from a different part of town, Octavia is definitely is a great reason for us to return to Pac Heights.', Custom earthy plates, curated Chinese desserty utensils, & legally haunted #melvinbelli tables?

This place takes not just its own addy but the whole moctafoctan street. After my experience, I can see why., 'Day 3 I think and ... wow ... The food was stellar and we tried about 60% of the menu. The food: same same and a little different than Frances. As with her i think the stars are the smaller dishes, soup wizardry and desserts. Wine is fantastic. The vibe: warm and cozy with the same great attention to detail as Frances. The space is completely transformed in a good way. Not as cramped...Loved the open kitchen. A couple of familiar faces. All in all I feel fortunate to look forward to being a regular here. Well done!!', Octavia is Frances' younger sister. The food is just like Frances but I would have to give the ambiance to Octavia. I love that they have ginger beer. Her soup is magic as always and her starters are most delicious. Overall it is an excellent experience. And, I am glad that it's only less than a mile from my house., Wow, I am SO happy this place has opened and is MUCH closer to where I live than Frances! There was a great selection of vegetarian starters for the hubby and we ended up trying most of them. We loved how the veggies were so fresh and tasty - loved the peas in the avocado dish, the mushrooms had great flavor, the house made ricotta was heavenly, and asparagus was so juicy! I also had the beef tongue that just melted in my mouth. I stuck with the beef theme and ordered the rib eye that was just decadent. They made a pasta dish with spring veggies for the hubby which he LOVED. The ONLY complaint is that I wish they had a dedicated vegetarian entree, which would have made deciding how to order a little easier.The crumb pudding with rhubarb was the perfect way to end the meal. We'll be back!, Excellent - the restaurant was a little warm for us on a Saturday night, reservation at 9:30. Ordered several small starters as well as a pasta and a dry aged ribeye. Wine program had a number of affordable selections and prices by the glass were reasonable as well. Server allowed us a taste of a wine which was good, but we preferred something else, and that wasn't a problem.After I ordered, the table next to us was delivered their ribeye and they raved about it for 20 minutes. Once our ribeye arrived, we found it exceptional as well. We asked, and were told it was dry aged for 50 days. Delicious. Desserts were solid and excellent coffee service. A little too much time between courses but that was probably some of our impatience to receive the next course.Will return often., 'Who doesn love date night?Pick a great restaurant that serves wonderfully delicious food and youe almost guaranteed an awesome night. Throw in some booze and some oysters, and youe guaranteed an even better night. *Wink Wink*Opening on Thursday, April 16th, comes Octavia, Francessister restaurant in the old Baker and Banker space. Having a been to Frances several times, I knew we were in for a treat with Octavia. The New American menu is comprised with seven bites/small apps ($3.50 - $8), four small plates ($9-$13), four entrees ($24-$48), and five desserts ($8-$9). Wine and beer only but they do have a house loophole cocktail and a good variety of vermouth available. Wines by the glass were $10-$22+ (house wine is $15/glass). Like every new restaurant that has been popping up, portions are small so expect to spend around $80-$100 a person for a full meal with wine. Reservations are highly recommended as we saw several parties turned away. Do note, that you need to provide a credit card to secure reservations and there a 48 hour cancellation policy. If they can reseat your table, you will be charged $25 per person and the credit will be applied on your next visit. ~ * ~ D R I N K S ~ * ~*House Cocktail: Lillet blanc, vermouth, petal, thorn ($10): bit.ly/1JZeaXV*Domaine de Galouchey - Bordeaux - Vin de Jardin - 2011 ($22/glass): bit.ly/1DtiJ7kI a hard booze girl so getting things started with a cocktail was a must. Usually not a fan of loophole cocktails because they tend to be overly sweet but the house cocktail was good. I asked for a red wine to pair with the ribeye and was brought the most expensive one at $22/glass.

We were requested the steak rare-plus and was told the kitchen tends to undercook their steaks, and that medium rare should be sufficient. It arrived medium. *sad pouty lip* Other than that, the rib eye was deliciously tender and flavorful from the 60 dry aging process. Additionally like another reviewer had commented, I wish the steak had charred crust.

As it was opening week, there were some kinks but that to be expected with any new restaurant. For example, there was a 30+ minute lag before receiving our steak entrd9e.

The food is reasonably priced, inventive, and healthy without compromising flavor. We had the Oysters, Brokaw Avocado Salad, Kale Salad, Mushrooms A La Grecque, Onion Soubise (perfection!), and the Halibut. The level of service is impressive, and the atmosphere is relaxed and inviting. Getting a reservation might be challenging at this point but they do save a few tables for walk-ins.', Had a reservation for 7pm Saturday night we arrived a little early and were seated within minutes . What a great ambience and decor just love the look ! Ok now to the food - we basically got 3 of the small plates which are about two or 3 bites if you share with someone else we got the black ink pasta , asparagus and artichoke to start wow what bursts of flavor and god that's delicious and of course with the divine Josey baker bread you can't go wrong. Then we chose a vegetable entree and the tasty salt cod pasta both delicious and just the right amount of seasoning. For dessert we had the warm chocolate something with salted caramel ice cream and strawberries with panna cotta - heavenly !! Drinks seem a little pricey but overall a great experience, excellent food and definitely a new restaurant favorite for me ! Ps price was reasonable too, Awesome all around. For a restaurant that recently opened, they've got their stuff together. The top part of the menu are the small bites - for 2 people, we ordered about 4 small dishes and it was plenty and we split the ribeye which was a huge portion and was cooked so nicely. everything was yummy and delicious. We did the carafe of the house wine both in white and red and they were both very good for house wine., 'We happened upon Octavia and were delighted with our experience. The ambience, the wine and especially the cuisine. We had a bunch of small plates, oysters, the squid ink pasta, paccheri and cod, beef tongue, soubise and mushrooms, and for dessert the stand outs were the panna cotta and the chocolate souffld9 and ice-cream. The lovely people next to us had the halibut and squab and they were very enthusiastic in their appraisal. The chef, in a word, is excellent.The service was exceptional - our waiter, rodolfo, was wonderful as were all the rest of the staff.', Sunday date night to check out our new neighborhood gem Octavia on 4/27. The space that once housed Quince and Baker and Banker has transformed into the lovely and rustic Octavia. The restaurant has barely been open a couple weeks but we thought it was running smoothly. No one seemed to be waiting on reservations and most of the tables were filled. The room is casually elegant yet intimate. The dishware is custom made for Octavia and complement the feel of the room. We ordered the squid ink pasta, hen of the wood mushrooms, grilled asparagus and beef tongue as our small plates. The beef tongue was so delicately savory and the squid ink noodles brought the perfect mix of salt, tang and heat. For entrees, we tried the quail and pacherri with cod. The quail was the meatiest and moistest quail we've every tasted and packed a lot of flavor. The pacherri had great sauce that I wish I had more of. For dessert the standout dish was the chocolate souffld9 tart. It is like a molten chocolate cake encased in a chocolate crumb crust and presented on a bed of warm caramel and caramel ice cream. We also tried the honeycrumb pudding which had more of a rustic cake consistency but it just couldn't complete with the chocolate. Overall a solid meal. We didn't feel engorged or hungry. Just happy and excited to return when the menu has picked up new dishes., 'The food here was so damn good that I could almost ignore the fact that it was so noisy I couldn hear my dining companion and that they are still working out some service issues.TL:DR review-delicious homey but classy food served in a very noisy setting with entrees in the 20 and starter in the 10. Plan at least 30-50 a person without drinks. Plan on screaming to hear your dining companions. Plan on this place being very popular.The food is not the most radical but that was some of the best beef tongue Ie had in SF in a while outside of a Mexican restaurant.The smaller plates were the standouts for us. The beef tongue with broccolini and a delicious broth was pure heaven with melt in your mouth tongue. The deviled egg was just one soft boiled egg in a spicy sauce, I would have loved something with a contrasting texture and $5 for one egg still kills me. The mushroom and green garlic soup was also incredibly good, it reminded me of soup in France where it has the right balance of being rich while still maintaining a lightness and airiness to the creamy soup. The Mushrooms a la Grecque was probably my least favorite dish although the portion was more condiment or snack size than starter or app size. It was not like what is common in France where the dish comes from or at least that name does but the French Spouse liked it well enough.The French Spouse enjoyed their pasta with salt cod which they said they could make in two portion size. My quail was cooked well but it lacked salt and seasoning within the bird and on the skin. The morel and jus that came with it were the real stars but alas there was not enough of either.We finished with a comped Panna Cotta which was delicious but a bit loose for my liking and a poppy seed angel food cake which I found quite fascinating with the crisp outside, not as sweet as most angel food cake and delightful with the berries and really good ice cream.The non-alcoholic drinks are limited to bottled sodas, teas, espresso drinks and water.Decor: What is with restauranteurs spending money on designed and then not doing anything about sound design or accessibility? That is whack and I am seeing it more and more in places that are charging over 25 a plate. When did being cool mean being noisy and unaccessible or perhaps it just the market they going after. There were many many tech guys in jeans (not guessing, I literally recognized people) with skinny girls in stilletos and perfectly straighten hair as well as old fashioned older WASPs. The bathrooms and door are not wheelchair accessible. The light is poor and the sound is even worse than Alta CA.Service: There were issues, not surprising for a place that has only been open a couple of weeks. There is no front host stand so there was confusion as to whether anyone had helped the people at the front door. Our server wanted to take our order without asking if we had questions or even explaining the menu which is odd since for 99 percent of the diners it was a new restaurant. There was also long gaps between course which the tables on either side of us did not experience. I will admit I was thrilled to look in a kitchen it not be all bearded bros. It amazing how few woman are running kitchens in SF and it would be great if that changed considering how many excellent female chefs there are.', Happy days for all of us who love Frances, but had a hard time getting in. Chef Melissa Perello has opened a sister restaurant, Octavia, at long last. The new place is on the site of the recently closed Baker and Banker but has been given a remodel. The room is light and airy, tables are well-spaced, and there is an open kitchen so it is possible to see the magic as it is getting prepared. And the new place has that most essential of all things, Chef Perello. Simply put, she has a deft touch with food; her plates are all well-considered and come together beautifully.I started with a small plate of chilled squid ink noodles with bottarga, lemon oil and green garlic. I can't say how many times squid ink noodles have disappointed, generally because the taste of squid ink just wasn't there. Here, the noodles tasted of squid ink and the dish was complex and assertive with the addition of the other components. Lovely food.Next, a gift from the chef: morel mushrooms over toast. Here is a quick review: Yum and thank you chef.A salad of little gems with blue cheese, grilled red onion, ramps and buttermilk was complex although the taste of the little gems was a bit overwhelmed by everything else. I think the onions were a bit much for the greens.Finally, a main of halibut with bintje potatoes, ramps and green garlic fumet was perfection. Halibut is so easy to ruin, but here the seafood was perfectly cooked but not overcooked. The potatoes were a revelation and the broth in which the seafood was nestled brought everything together.I would be remiss if I failed to mention that the pricing for this wonderful meal was modest. A bargain meal in San Francisco., 'Octavia is a beautiful restaurant: open, airy, friendly, and cozy. The staff is attentive and friendly, and we loved our meal. My friend and I shared two starters, a salad and an entree and were deliciously full at the end.Crispy artichokes - out of this world. If they brought me this in a bucket, I would have had it all and called it a day.Grilled asparagus - I don LOVE asparagus, but this dish was fantastic.Spinach salad - again, for something that could be just so-so, it was delicious.Ribeye with charred radishes and (more) asparagus - In small places like this, sometimes you have to lower your expectations for how the steak will turn out. No need here at Octavia - this was incredible meat, perfectly cooked and seasoned. I was blown away. As a young restaurant, there are two small things I noted that I sure they can work out: Timing - the pacing of our meal seemed slower than it should have been. Maybe it was deliberate, but if so they need to find a better balance between not rushing our meal and not making us wait too long between dishes. Bread service - we saw the bread basket being offered up to some tables, but never to us. We were actually fine with that, but at the end of the meal were curious why. Our waiter informed us that, like water, bread is available upon request. That made sense to us both...but unlike the water shortage, there isn a bread shortage that everyone is aware of. Considering Octavia prints up fresh menus every day, Bread upon request could certainly be added at the bottom.', 'I have to say the entire experience, from the moment I stepped inside, was a complete delight. Ie been a huge fan of Frances, and somehow Chef Melissa Perello has managed to surpass all expectations with Octavia.The restaurant was full when we arrived, and yet, while busy, the energy was far from frenetic or stressful --I would describe it as more of an upbeat, harmonious vibe, which I later attributed to the incredible way the staff just worked together; like so well, that I needed to note that. I also learned, from talking with our waiter, that Chef Perello own style in the kitchen seems to be rather zen, which made complete sense as the atmosphere in the dining area as well as the food preparation and presentation was, to me, just flawless.As for the food itself... I running out of amazing adjectives here; I was just dumbfounded. The flavors and textures were so amazingly well thought-out... and clever! My friend and I tried quite a few dishes. The beef tongue in marrow broth (and anyone turned off by eating tongue will thank me if they get over it just once to try this dish) was so tender you could cut into it with a spoon. The soubise was a frothy, creamy onion soup with maitaki mushrooms and a pistachio pesto, and I don think Ie ever had a more delightful soup. The deviled egg (in quotes because it not the conventional deviled egg) was a perfectly done, peeled, soft-boiled egg with chile relish and spices --and while I not much for spicy, the flavors Chef Perello chose just worked so well together.Yet after all that, the highlight for me was my quail entrd9e, with morel mushrooms and spinach. I getting a little teary-eyed because I loved this so much! My friend ordered the halibut, and that too was extremely well-prepared.The one downside to the evening was our own doing: we left literally no room for dessert. As it was my birthday, someone on staff decided that would not do, and we were brought out two chocolate biscuits topped with sea salt, and it was just perfection.The decor was a simple country rustic, borrowing from what I knew from Frances, but perhaps up a notch. I absolutely loved everything about Octavia, and would go here again in a heartbeat.', Excellent and definitely worth checking out!It didn't feel quite as intimate as I had hoped due to how packed the tables are., 'Officially my new last meal on earth: beef tongue from Octavia.', Every small plate/appetizer we had was unbelievable. I'd happily go back and eat just those! Best asparagus dish ever, a super delicious pickled mushroom number, loved the squid ink noodles, deviled egg - all amazing. I also loved how various folks from the kitchen delivered dishes to our table with a short & sweet explanation - very approachable vibe. For mains we did the ribeye (delicious!) & a halibut (I think? Can't remember - under other circumstances, delicious, but compared to everything else that graced our table, meh).Since we visited in the first ~3 weeks of opening, we dealt with some minor bumps (slow service, multiple waiters juggling our table, forgetting drinks/parts of our order, favoring other tables who I assume were critics). Will 100% be back in a few months when those kinks are hopefully worked out., 'The food is very delicious. It says the reservation needs 2 weeks in advance! fortunately my friends and I got reservation long time ago. No waiting is needed.', Tried to make a reservation but being a new restaurant they were booked of course. Walked in and we're lucky enough to get a table right away. The food was fantastic. Ordered the spring veggies, fried artichokes and the pacheri with baccala to start. Everything was delicious! Had the salmon and ribeye to share. Both cooked perfectly and seasoned so well. The service was outstanding. But the timing from last appetizer to entree lagged about 30 minutes which we didn't mind because it gave us time to digest since we were feeling full already. The desserts were amazing. I loved the honey crumb pudding. The flavored were so good together. The chocolate souffld9 tart was very good too but was a little too sweet for me. They have a great selection of wines and cocktails. And the restaurant is decorated very well for such a small space. By the way the bathroom is unmarked looks like you're walking into a closet lolThe restaurant is only 3 blocks from my house which is convenient for me but is located in very residential area, so parking will be difficult. There are no other businesses around for a few blocks which kind of has the feel like you are having dinner in someone's home. Highly recommend !!, 'Nice location. We asked for and got the table in the corner with a nice view of the surrounding residential neighborhood. Sunday night, but restaurant was packed. Good service, waiter knowledgeable and with nice style. Only a few dishes on the menu. We had beef tongue and pasta dish for appetizer, beef tongue was particularly good. Quail and veggie dish for main course were also very good. Beer selection is limited and a bit odd.', 'The food is delicious. The service is excellent. Our group had a combination of starters and entrees and nothing was disappointing. The beef tongue despite my wariness was so tasty and I really enjoyed the smoked mussels and potatoes. We shared all the desserts and they were all amazing. My favorite was the poppy seed angel cake with blueberry sorbet but they were all so good it was a hard choice.', 'I just found my new favorite restaurant in San Francisco. From food to decor, everything is done thoughtfully, without being too fussy. We particularly liked the deviled egg and warm bintje potatoes, the salmon and the panade. But I suspect we would have been equally happy with pretty much anything on the menu based on the dishes I saw being placed on surrounding tables.', 'i love frances.naturally, i was excited to try octavia and we lucked out on a table for two right when they opened at 5pm on a friday.started with 3 oysters in fennel mignonette. very plump and fresh. great way to start the meal.second, the grilled asparagus. thick stalks of asparagus in warm miso brown butter with shallots and herbs. the asparagus still had some crunch to it, which i love. so delicious.the deviled egg. a soft-boiled egg dredged in a few types of chilies. definitely spicy. would be good with a piece of levain, maybe, to soak up the runny yolk.beef tongue. wow. i was expecting this one to be tough, but it couldn have been more tender. (maybe beef tongue is always tender? what do i know.) flaked off at the slightest prod from my fork. the marrow broth and charred broccoli were perfect together.we wanted to end our meal on a lighter note, so we finished with the pot of mushrooms with levain and the romaine hearts. both were fantastic.il definitely be back.', Food was more of a 3.5 but service push this review to a 4. This is very on par with restaurants like stones throw or 1760. But I prefer those two over Octavia. I came to dinner with high hopes which quickly diminished. Everything tasted OK, but there wasn't a stand out dish amongst what we order...and we ordered a lot.Oh well...c'est la vie!, Delicious! We took our parents here who are in town visiting and decided to check out this gem, creating quite the buzz after only two weeks. Standout dishes were the fried artichokes small plate, the ribeye, pasta with salted cod, halibut, and chocolate souffld9 tart.The small plates are quite small, but very flavorful. The fried artichokes especially were cooked amazingly well - best artichokes I've ever had. The dry aged ribeye was also extremely tasty - huge portion (we split among four of us), cooked to perfection, honestly the best steak I've had in a really long time. Everything else was also delicious, and the service was great! Everyone was very friendly and happy to offer us recommendations when we were crippled by all of the options. It also had a wonderful ambience.Loved this place and will definitely be back!, Overall 3.5 Stars4 stars - Lovely restaurant with very good wait staff3 stars for food...here is break down2.5 stars - oysters - fresh but I felt the mignonette need more acid. It really didn't taste like anything to me2.5 stars - Squid Ink NOODLES - ok but for me not memorable3 stars - DEVILED EGG - good egg and sauce was quite interesting but for me not especially memorable4 stars - BEEF TONGUE - yummm!4 stars - Salt Cod - another yummm!3.5 stars - RIB-EYE - delicious but it needed a touch more Horseradish to punch it upWould definitely return to hit up the beef tongue and salt cod. Looking forward to trying other items on menu., Beautifully designed place with good service. It's definitely high end without feeling stuffy. Food was good overall though some dishes were great and others were only okay. My top picks were the beef tongue and the butter bean garlic soup. Those were amazing. The soup in particular was mind blowing.The salt cod pasta was interesting and the pasta was really well done but it just didn't come together well enough that I'd get it again. The quail was a nice size and light but just wasn't amazing. I think it's reasonably priced for the quality you're getting here., Amazing experience. Made a reservation to come back at the end of my meal. Spring onion soup was the best soup I've ever had. Heavenly. Service was a bit inattentive, but not terribly so. The steak was enormous., Great food. We started with some salads, had the risotto and rib-eye and finished with the chocolate souffle. All excellent, no complaints. However, I was disappointed that the menu appears to be exactly the same as Frances. I'd like to see some differentiation, then we'd have an excuse to visit both more often.The seating is too cramped. This causes it to be too noisy and you're in the middle of other peoples' conversations. Even worse, we were stuck between two other two tops and the servers had a hard time waiting on us. The service was also a bit slow (maybe due to the cramped issue), even getting some bread took forever.Rearrange the tables or delete a few seats and be more original with the menu and you'll move up to 5 star status. As it is now, we both agreed that we'd rather eat at Frances even though we live much closer to Octavia., I'm a total fan. Everything was amazing start to finish. Food delicious. Service attentive and thoughtful but not overbearing. Our waiter found out we were celebrating an anniversary and he quickly added 2 candles to 2 of our desserts - classy touch.Starters: chilled squid ink noodles, Cortez bottarga, fennel, lemon oil - small dish, very tasty.Main dish: red snapper, potatoes, capers, creme fraiche, dill, green beans - cooked and seasoned to perfectionMain dish: Chicken roulade - perfectly cooked and vegetables were fresh and deliciousDessert - Toasted almond Profiteroles, noyaux ice cream - deliciousDessert - Summer berry Eton Mess - perfect way to celebrate in-season berriesDessert- Wild flower honey crumb pudding - little savory, warm and my fav dessertOne note, they have bread but will only bring it upon request. Definitely get the bread, it's warm and so so good!Hats off to the interior designers. They did a fantastic job with the space. It feels spacious and cozy while at the same time elegant. Love the huge windows which bring in all the light.I'm definitely coming back when the menu changes!, 'Text message from my sister: Want to eat dinner on Wednesday?Me: Yes. Where?Sister: OctaviaI have never been to Frances before but Octavia was a great mid-week treat. Their bread was amazing. We had 3 slices each, haha.To share- the beef tongue, really tender! We gobbled it up. ($8)Sister had the Chicken Roulade which she had at Frances previously. Delicious with sausage stuffed in the middle. Super moist and yummy! ($27)I had the Rib-Eye. Medium rare with some root veggies and greens atop. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. ($38)For dessert we opted for the Warm Chocolate Souffle Tart with Salted Caramel ice cream. INHALED. ($9)Service was EH...pretty inattentive and lackluster. The napkins were linty and got little lint bits over my black dress. The table next to us was offered black napkins which we were not. Inconsistent in service standards. Anyways, food is good but I say don expect much from the staff.', Dare I say that Octavia is better than Frances. Yeah and I totally did during the entire meal. Repeatedly. A lot. And probably enough to annoy my husband but what do I care - he is married to me and stuck with me. I'll be as bold to say it's the best restaurant right now in SF (and totally better than the overhyped State Bird Provisions - which is good but not GREAT).We tried to recap what we liked the most, so here it is in the order of MY favorites (different than my husband's):Beef tongue: Apparently beef tongue is fatty, delicate, and pulled-pork like in its consistency. It's not at all chewy. This stuff just melted in your mouth. I had no idea that beef tongue was so delicious. I was always grossed out by the concept, but this dish totally converted me into a beef tongue fiend. Forget the steaks. Cut off all their tongues and give me their milk. Also, I now have a mental note to go to fancy butcher shops and buy a lot of beef tongues to cook.Chocolate torte (dessert): I thought this would be a standard fare but was feeling the idea of having dessert. I was delightfully wrong. I went to Liholiho for their baked Hawaiian (which is EXCELLENT) but this actually outdid it. It was chocolate HEAVEN. Best of all, the salted caramel melted into the hot torte... and then there were crunchy chunks of dark chocolate around it (yay for food texture!). I kept making awful jokes to my husband (that were pretty serious in nature) that I wanted to kidnap the baker and bring him/her home with us. Then lock them in a room with an oven and cocoa.Romano beans: Had thought of not getting it. So glad we got it. Flash fried so it was very lightly crispy and then there were small fried onion bits on top of it. Second favorite starter.Halibut crudo: My husband's favorite. For sushi and tartare lovers. Halibut was raw and silky, avocados were buttery and firm, and the crisps were (duh) crispy. Saffron tonarelli: Tomatoes were fresh and acidic. Saffron was present but not overwhelming. Dish had just enough oil. So good.Butter beans and garlic with mushroom soup: Buttery. Creamy. Delicious.Deviled egg: Poached egg with melty yolk and a lot of hot spicy stuff. Very good. Surprised it wasn't my favorite dish - the egg specials are usually my favorite at every restaurant I go to. Goes to show the caliber of Octavia. Soooo good. This probably would have been my favorite at any other restaurant.Chilled squid ink noodles: Excellent but not as memorable as the other dishes. Oysters: Good.Also the complimentary bread was served perfectly warm, the butter was fresh and light. Everything was perfect. Wine was excellent (I think it was the Tenuta 2010). Service was attentive and on pointe. Really have nothing bad to say about the restaurant. Ranking the dishes was incredibly hard. Please take all my money., My friend treated me to dinner for my birthday. It was magnificent in every way!I love Frances so I was very excited to try Octavia. It exceeded my expectations.I appreciate the great selections offered in their wine list. The food was phenomenal...every dish was outstanding!The two of us tried: Crudo - Umami in your mouth! Deviled Eggs - I almost skipped on this until the server explained that it was a soft boiled egg. It was silky smooth and divine. Chilled squid ink noodles - perfect texture and flavors, it was actually refreshing and not heavy Pork chops - Juicy, tender, deliciuos Steak - Generously portioned, perfectly cooked and very rich in flavor. It was the one dish we couldn't finish..and as a left overs it was just as amazing. It was a terrific meal and I look forward to repeat visits., 'I am not sure what the fuss is about. The food was only ok. The deviled eggs were soft and warm however the seasonings and spices were not very complimentary. The quail was rather bland. The rib eye was average as was the service and the space. With so many great choices in SF to spend your money I would go somewhere else.', Love the variety of fresh, local ingredients, all prepared with expert, delicate care. I'm in love with any of Chef Perello's fresh pasta dishes, soups, and unique treats (like the beef tongue, yum!). But, I was BLOWN away with the Ribeye! And I rarely save room for desert, but that souffld9 is incredible. Will be back soon, and often!, i came here for dinner last night w/ my friend and it was great. i had been to the same space for both quince and baker and banker, and it is not unrecognizable! the restaurants before were a more dark and fancy, and it is now super light and airy w/ an open kitchen. love the new space!for food, we tried a bunch of stuff. we couldn't decide, so we had our server help us out. we ended up w/ the chilled squid ink noodles, marinated mushrooms w/ grilled bread, hamachi crudo, corn soup, and the ricotta dumplings. i am usually not into ricotta dumplings, but we saw our neighbor eating it, and it looked great, so we got it. omg, it was so delicious! it was definitely on the heavier side, so sharing the dish w/ my friend was perfect.for dessert, we got the summer berry eton mess, which was the perfect way to end the evening. can't wait to go back!, Oh man! No disappointment from appetizers to dessert! Excellent service. I had to agree with other Yelpers that the beef tongue is to die for! Super tender and juicy! I loved how our server divided our corn soup into two portions, so we could each have our own bowl. Don't forget to try their summer berry dessert!This will be one of my favorite restaurants in the city :), A fantastic dining experience in line with the high expectations that San Francisco foodies have. We went there for our anniversary dinner. Great decor, blending SF charm and modern chic. A really good wine selection that will satisfy the most sophisticated of taste. The menu and food was creative and diverse. All of our appetizers were perfectly constructed, with complex flavors and textures. The entrees were equally as good and of special note the pork was perhaps the most amazing I've ever had (this coming from a pork connoisseur). Of special note I'd like to personally thank Gina, she really made our dining experience extraordinary. From making us feeling very welcome, to her professionalism and suggestions on food. She rocks! Good job Octavia, for delivering at the highest standards., Just go, it's worth it.Highlights:Pork ChopDumplingsDevil EggBread, Have come in here a couple of times by myself or with husband for a quick snack and glass before our 6pm apt across the street. Nice menu and by the glass options. Some aps more hits than others. Came in today to an almost empty restaurant and without a look of recognition or even a hint of a smile to matre'd tells me he is fully booked and had only a few tables reserved for walk ins. Ummm that's what I am... I told him I've come in here before and that I was planning on a quick bite and would be on my way in about twenty. He tells me he's sorry. Flat faced. So in my opinion a feeding establishment should be accommodating within reason, inviting and friendly in addition to good food. If you fail the first three the last is pretty much moot., 'My wife and I are fans of Frances, Octavia definitely did not disappoint. At some restaurants, some dishes are great, some are so so...We liked everything we tried at Octavia, the food across the menu is consistently delicious and they have a nice selection of wine as well. The beef tongue was outstanding, and the preparation of the oysters was unique and complimentary to the flavors of the oyster.', 'The old Baker and Banker spot. Opened in mid-April. Came across an early dinner reservation on a Sunday night and couldn pass it up since this is hot and new. Ie been to the sister restaurant Frances a long time ago and wasn that impressed, but was ready to give this new place a try. Food/drinks- chilled squid ink noodles: delicious, a fancy pasta salad; mushroom  la creque lots of mushroom flavor and came with toast; beef tongue and marrow broth: good, but a bit disappointed especially after reading yelpersreviews saying it amazing; turnip greens and rapini salad: very refreshing, enjoyed a lot: king salmon: beautifully cooked medium rare with classic components, summer berry Eton mess: amazing dessert, refreshing yet creative in terms of flavors and textures, would order again; bread: read some yelp reviews saying bread is available upon request though not written anywhere on the menu, but our waitress kindly asked us if we wanted any bread without us asking, it was really good seeds/nut bread; had a glass of Chardonnay which was niceAmbiance/Decor- clean, modern and sleek with open kitchen. I couldn tell that much things were different compared to the former restaurant that was here, but I sure there were. I liked the tables and chairs, bench seating available at one corner of the restaurant. Service/Staff- friendly and attentive. Seated immediately at our table when we arrived on time for our reservation. Our waitress wore cowboy boots, how cute. There were white (fabric) napkins on the table already but the waitress brought over a black one especially for me after we ordered our food/drinks because I was wearing black pants. I very much appreciated that since it is a pain to have white lint sticking to black pants, which happened to me before! The items we ordered were all correct and other staff were attentive to take away/replace plates and refill water etc. throughout our meal. Tips- there is no sign to or on the restroom door so I almost went into the kitchen side door thinking it was the restroom! Restroom is located at the back, left of the kitchen; it door looks like a closer and is grey/white color. Make reservations, drop ins are difficult, at least during this time when the restaurant is still fairly new. We saw Brett Cooper, the ex-chef of Outerlands/current chef at Aster came in to dine. Very interesting to see the chef circle interact and so that was cool. I sure he got to taste everything on the menu!Overall a solid restaurant that I actually enjoyed much more compared to Frances. Most things were prepared in a fairly classic way, but I think that Melissa style. Food and wine was delicious, everything was executed well, service was awesome, and the place is nice. I was content.', What a surprise! I think Melissa has outdone Francis. Everything we had was excellent. The beef tongue melts in your mouth. The green beans were prefectly cooked. The highlight of the entire meal was the corn chowder. Both my wife and I thought it was the best corn soup we have ever tried. We had the salomon entre which I wasn't crazt about. Not that it wasnt good, because it was perfectly cooked. It's just that it is something you can prepare at home without too much fuss. The service was spot on. Our server was previously at Quince and then at Francis for 5 years and was asked to move to Octavia. Melissa was wise to pull vetran staff from Francis to open this restaruant. Their professionalism shows well for a new venture. For dessert we had the chocolate souffle with caramel which was very good. Their wine list is very nice and quite extensive including dessert wines. This is a super replacement for Baker and Banker and should become even more successful as time passes. The decor is very pleasant and gave a nice feeling of calmness. I would highly recommed this restaruant., 'What a phenomenal place! We loved everything we ordered, and only wished we had bigger stomachs to eat everything on the menu. Our favorites were the beef tongue and almond puff with basil ice cream! The beef tongue melted in my mouth and the basil ice cream was so refreshing! The wait staff was very attentive and paid close attention to everything. My only compliant was the wait time for the main entree. It took more than 30 mins for the entree to come after everything else was perfectly on the spot.', 'Award winning chef Melissa Perello is at it again! Octavia is an elegant restaurant that happens to be named after the street it lies on...Octavia! HahaMy girlfriend and I dined here on a Friday around 6pm. Surprising we got seats without a wait, though the restaurant was at capacity throughout our time here. Starters:Chilled Squid Ink Noodles: This was cooked to perfection and had just the right amount of lemon oil added to it. Beef Tongue: The accompanying ingredients were roasted garlic and a marrow broth. In my opinion this was the best dish offered. I could have ordered this over and over again. 5 stars!!Local Halibut: 4 stars. I felt as if I was having sashimi thought the avocado and chips gave it a good western feelingWhite Corn Soup: 4 stars. I have a thing for anything that contains or is made from corn. This was a great soup though it was a tad bit too creamy for my liking. Snapper: My girlfriend ordered this and thoroughly enjoyed. She said it was cooked well and the fish melted in her mouth. All in a all a very good experience. Octavia is relatively new and word of mouth is getting around regarding how good it is so get a reservation if you can! If not dine here earlier during the week :)', 'Thoroughly enjoyed everything about this restaurant! Had a 5PM reservation and wanted to never leave..Firstly, our server Kim was amazing in every way possible. Tried the following dishes - and all were excellent:DEVILED EGG (warning spicy hot)Mushrooms A LA GRECQUEHALIBUT CrudoWhite CORN SOUPGEM Lettuce SaladKing SALMON andand various wines, too Even with so many good places to eat in SF - this one is a real standout representing greatness - in food and service and ambiance.Will definitely be back.Kudos!', 'I can comfortably upgrade my review to 5 stars now! Just went back to Octavia a few nights ago and had a great experience. The food was amazing from top to bottom. Some of the highlights:Deviled Egg - Great, similar to my experience from last time. The pepper on the top has the right amount of kick but is not super spicy.Beef Tongue - Not tough and chewy at all, which was what I was expecting from beef tongue. Velvety, soft beef with a great beef jus that was both rich and subtle.Corn Soup - Chef Perello always makes a great soup. This is no exception. Extremely smooth, buttery corn soup with a great addition of creme fraiche.Pork Chop - Well-cooked, juicy and tender medium-rare.House red by the carafe was pretty light and complemented most of the dishes well. We had a great time and will be back again! Hard to split time between Frances and Octavia now.', 'overrated. The dishes LOOK as fancy as interior design. Some of the cuisines are freaking salted!', Cute restaurant located on the corner of Bush and Octavia. Basic menu, not too fussy but done very well. Fish, pasta, beef and pork selections for entrees and smaller plates that felt in time with the season. Our table ordered a rib eye and it was cooked perfectly. We also enjoyed the pork chop with peaches that was a good portion and nicely done, a ricotta dumpling that was freshly made and a halibut crudo (was fantastic! By far best thing we ordered ). The dessert menu had a choice for just about any type of sweet- tooth. We ordered a chocolate cake and profiterole dessert, it was good and what you'd expect. The bar menu was pretty creative, the wine list was a bit all over tho. I spyed a few known name bottles with a hefty markup.... you may want go off the grid here and try something new. My only other knock on this place, outside of the wine, was how difficult it is to park. It's located on a busy street and there are apartments nearby...we circled for some time. We were coming from out of town so could not cab/walk there. I would say tho, Id frequent the restaurant again if in the area and would definitely recommend it to others. Check it out!, 'We had a wonderful meal at Octavia last week, sampling dishes from every part of the menu. While not typically a fan of eggplant, our server spoke very highly of the miso eggplant dish, and it was excellent (or was it eggcelent?). We also had the hallibut crudo. The eggplant was very comforting and warm, and the hallibut was incredibly refreshing. We couldn pick a favorite becuase they were both so delicious! We then shared the tonnarelli pasta and the corn chowder soup. Again, both were executed wonderfully. The tonnarelli was just the right amount of food for an in between course. The soup was a lot of food! I have a feeling I will crave it on any cold day--it was comforting and well executed. For the main course, we had ricotta dumplings and the ribeye. Again, both were great, but both were larger than we anticipated! The ribeye was probably the most disappointing part of the entire meal, but only because it was a good steak that didn stand out among all of the other dishes. We ended with the chocolate tart, which our server insisted that we have. I am glad he did! It was really delicious. Overall, the entire experience was great. The food was wonderful, the ambiance was warm, and the service was fantastic.', I had mixed feelings about posting a review of Octavia. The appetizers and desserts were outstanding but the entrees were uninspired (salmon, chicken, steak, vegetarian risotto). In fact, both my friend and I decided (for the first time ever) to forgo ordering entrees because they all sounded so pedestrian. Staff was wonderful, great ambiance, and I'd like to support neighborhood restaurants. I just wish they had at least one stand out entree and more old world wines by the glass., 'I came here on opening night, and these guys already had there stuff on point.The decor is gorgeous, cozy, and unpretentious.The food is creative, inspired, and versatile.The staff is friendly and smart.The bread is to die for :)', It was definitely a five star dinner for me!! Starting from the bread, which was amazing !!! My friends and I Shared the chilled squid ink noodles, it was a great way to start our meal, followed by the beef tongue in a bone marrow broth which just melted in our mouths, we also tried the corn soup, simple and delicious, you could really taste the sweetness of the corn, from the entree section we had the rib eye, perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned just the way a steak should be. And to finish we had the nectarine float which was definitely one of the best floats I've had! The lavender added an amazing touch! And the wildflower honey crumb pudding, perfect way to end a delicious dinner. Service was very attentive and on top of every detail., It was hands down the worst dining experience I had at a SF restaurant. Service was lackluster at best, and most of the food was unpalatable. The seasonal menu looked promising with bold dish offerings such as beef tongue and squid ink noodles with botargo. Our enthusiasm waned as our wait time for the remaining meal stretched frustratingly long. The chilled tomato soup lacked the sweet flavors of tomato now in season. The pork chop was overcooked. The gnocchi dish was outright inedible. Instead of pillows of softness, think meatball-sized dough balls with bland mushroom (it lacked any mushroom flavors). We were also promised bread but didn't get a slice until we were finished with our first courses. The table behind us came in later and ordered later were given bread, butter, and plates a good 10 minutes prior. The server also plonked down the bread that it almost dropped out of my plate. Never once did we get an apology for poor and careless service.It took almost 2 hours for us to get 2 first courses, a bowl of soup, and 2 entrees. We left feeling irritated and disappointed, vowing never to return. EVER., 'My boyfriend and I came here for our 1 year anniversary, and were impressed with the attentive yet unobtrusive service and food that was to die for. We started with the deviled egg, a soft boiled egg with the most delicious pepper sauce and deviled spices and the squid ink noodles. Both were incredibly flavorful, and rich enough that a few bites was the perfect amount to enjoy without being overwhelming. Following that we shared the tomato soup, which was creamy and sweet and just perfect for a summer evening. The tomatoes were allowed to speak for themselves, something I really appreciate about well done summer soups. For our entrees we had the salmon on a bed of farro and purslane and the pork chop with roasted nectarines. They were both phenomenal and cooked to perfection. For dessert we had the lemon poppyseed angel cake with berry sorbet and the mission fig crumble. Neither were overwhelmingly sweet, and the fruit balanced the baked goods of each dessert perfectly. Overall it was an awesome dining experience that I look forward to repeating!', Good food. Service could be better.Appetizers: we had the squid ink pasta, the deviled egg, and the eggplant. All were very rich in flavor and I was left wanting more. I don't even like eggplant, but this dish left me wanting more! For about $7 a plate, I was expecting more, and these were literally all ONE BITE worth of food. Entrees: I had the rib eye and is was perfection. Came with a side of peppers and kale. Flavors were amazing and it was perfectly cooked to my liking (medium rare). Good portion and it definitely left me full!The bread was delicious (you don't even need the butter), but we only were served that midway through our entree (and we had to ask for it). Had to hunt down my waitress for more water. Will definitely go back for the food, but won't be holding my breath for the service., My friend and I came here to catch up over drinks and dinner. Loved the interior - the open kitchen was nice. While it's a relatively small space, it still feels very airy.Service was great. We ordered the oysters; flavorful and creamy. The deviled egg was nice, mainly impressed by the sauce. We also got the squid ink noodles and the mushrooms with levain. I would suggest the squid ink noodles over the mushrooms, but both were very tasty.We shared the pork chop - cooked perfectly. Very moist and also crisp! Overall a good experience! I would go back; would probably just get small plates to share and skip the main dishes., I've been here twice now and tried a few different things. All on my just ok list: deviled egg, chilled squid ink noodles (hoping it'd be better!), mushroom starter, beef tongue, rib eye, Ricotta dumplings were better then ok. Their best thing on the menu is the corn soup! I might've tried a couple of the desserts - they were delicious but I can't remember what they were. Great ambiance and service.|1
40|per-se-new-york|This is Thomas Keller's new resturant in New York. A must if you can get a reservation., 'A fantastic experience. The food was as superb as French Laundry. The service is the best I have ever had, with remarkable attention to every request or dietary restriction. You can chose either a selection of 5 courses or a preselected list of 9 courses, which can be modified to suit your tastes. Reservations need to be made 2 months in advance, since there are only 16 tables and 2 seatings. Quite expensive, but absolutely worth it.', 'For $700 for two people, I expected to see more. The food was of course superb, the atmosphere fantastic and the experience ideal...but for $700 you can have an equally good meal at Daniel and buy a digital camera or some other $300-400 toy!', Ok, for close to $2000 for our dinner party of four, well it damn well better get five stars! Seriously, the service is impeccable, and the food and wine pairings are, at least for me, impossible to explain in words except to say heavenly. I had heard so much about Thomas Keller's French Laundry, all I have to say that it surpasses the hype. Extraordinary experience all around, definitely my pick for last meal on earth., 'Impeccable service with attentive staff that made us feel comfortable - they entertained our fun and quirky questions and the sommelier introduced us to a fantastic wine that was unavailable due to popularity when I requested it at French Laundry 2 weeks later. The menu changes, as with most top restaurants - but I was lucky enough to eat there during white truffle season - had the most amazing white truffle risotto. Their signature salmon cones amuse bouche was equally good as at FL. Ambiance was great - and the food kept coming!!! I ate so much I could hardly move - truly a gastronomical experience!', 'Very lovely, very gracious service and attention to detail. I had things which I had never tasted before and which were both fabulous and memorable. However, this remains an expense account place for me. Were I to use my own funds, I would probably go elsewhere.Definiately worth trying at least once to be able to formulate your own opinion. You will find value in some element.', We went for lunch which I'd recommend since it is a lengthy meal and quite filling. Lovely setting- wonderful and interesting materials. Food- a couple of courses in the beginning were not very exciting but it did get better towards the end. I don' t eat lamb so they made a special pasta course for me and loaded it with freshly sliced truffles. It was great. All in all I think there was too much butter and oil used and not enough fresh, clean, crisp offerings. Maybe it is better in summer/ fall? We were there in February. Staff was excellent and very friendly, as they should be at this level. I wouldn't go back., 'My fiancee brought me here as a surprise shortly before our trip to San Francisco (and a reservation at the French Laundry). I think the reviews posted thus far speak to the level of service you should expect. The wine sommelier makes you feel like a champ even if you know little-to-nothing about wine and he knows the dishes as if he created them himself. Ie read some comments elsewhere how people have left hungry. If you select the nine-course menu you have to be Fat Bastard to leave hungry. Just when you think youe done with everything, you get a tiered presentation of petits fours and a little goodie bag of macaroons to go. You may pooh-pooh the idea of going to the mall for a fancy meal but when youe floating (or rolling) down to street level afterward you won notice the difference. The only reservation left is for 5:30 PM? Not a problem - youl finish your meal in about four hours and still have time to party, if you can still move after all that food. The problem I have with nine course tasting menus is that it hard to remember everything I eat. I left mostly with the sensation of the overall experience, which is one of wonderment and awe. However, several dishes stand out. The cornets (salmon tartare with sweet red onion creme fraiche) are wonderful, but what remains engraved in my memory is oysters and pearls - two pearl-sized oysters floating on a tapioca sabayon and garnished with osetra caviar. Anyone who eats this in two bites should be summarily ejected from the premises. When we were served this dish again at the French Laundry, it was all I could do to keep myself from fist-pumping and yelling. Another dish I remember is a pasta with truffles dish that was served when I requested a substitution. Heavenly. The bowl was angled steeply along the edges sort of like a wine glass, with just enough space for you to just drop your head in and eat sans fork. The Deconstructed Snickers (photo attached) sparked a debate over whether Thomas Keller had to request permission to use the name or if Mars begged him for the publicity. The composed cheese course is one cheese with several accompaniments so you can explore the various facets of the cheese in detail. If you order coffee, the milk will be warmed. If youe dying to eat here and can get through the reservations line in the morning rush, call back later in the day and ask to be put on the waiting list. Youl be allowed to pick several days, and if there a cancellation theyl call you. Just be prepared to move on a moment notice. Guys - jacket is required, but Ie had a curious experience with that policy. The first time we went, I didn know where we were going so I had a dress shirt but no jacket. They didn turn us away. In fact, no one said anything. On our second visit, it was June and hot, so I had my jacket on my arm. Before the hostess escorted us into the restaurant, she smiled and discreetly motioned for me to put on my jacket. I took it off again promptly after seating - no injury, no penalty. I haven been back since the mandatory service charge was added. When youe done with your meal, be sure to ask for a tour of the kitchen. Youl also be taken inside the wine vault. If you want to remember what you ate, you can always ask for a copy of the menu on your way out... but I don think they deliver.', Either you're going to love it or you're going to feel like it was too expensive. Focus on the experience and come here if you want to have one.DATE ALERT!! This is a great place for a date if you like talking to the person you are spending time with. If he/she isn't intelligent/entertaining enough to carry on a conversation for 3 hours I'd suggest somewhere with dimmer lights, stronger drinks, and louder music.BUSINESS?Sitting down for a meal at Per Se means that you are committing at least 3 or 4 hours of your evening to this experience. Hopefully at the end everyone at the table is happy.EXPECTATIONS:Out of the courses we had only 2-3 of them stood out in my mind. Was a bit disappointed. Overall I would have to give this restaurant 3.5 stars but bumped it up because they really are trying to do great work. It is quite an experience. However if you're visiting from out of town and not a big foodie you might find it to be a bit too much.On the positive side the little goodie bag with the cookies was a nice touch at the end of our meal and even better the next afternoon.WOULD I GO BACK? It would have to be an appropriate occasion.Romance Factor: 7Hobnob Potential: 1Destination Rating: 6Note: Tiny portions in abundance will leave you full., 'Thoughtful dishes and tasty food. If price was weighed more here, I would give it a four and a half stars. I actually like Jean Georges and Picasso better. My wife likes Per Se better than Jean Georges, but we both agree Picasso kicks both their butts.', 'i was lucky enough to have dinner here with 3 lovely ladies, and we had such a great experience - everyone who worked there was incredibly friendly and attentive, the restaurant was beautiful and the food was just as good as youe heard. the only downside is that with nine courses, and lots of extra mini-courses in between, by the time we reached the meat courses we were already feeling pretty full. (actual quote from my friend: every time i see a waiter walk by with a plate, i get so scared that he coming to our table!) but that being said, every plate that did come to our table was absolutely delicious!another great option is to just drop in for a drink. you can walk right in, and you are treated to the ambience of the restaurant, plus some gorgeous views of columbus circle and the park. the gin and tonic is excellent, and they serve it with dishes of roasted peanuts and truffle oil-infused popcorn - yum!', 'Without a doubt the best dining experience in NYC. Had the tasting menu and everything was a winner except the sous vide lobster was a little rubbery. Oysters and pearls....OH MY GOD!! Poetry in your mouth. There was so much food I can barely remember all of it. The service is CHOREOGRAPHED!!! But not fussy.', A superlative experience -- the food was wonderful, the view is great and the service made me feel like royalty. Why only 4 stars then? Maybe it's just me but I don't think I have as much an appreciation for fine food as this requires. For $570, my partner and I had the chef's tasting menu for lunch (same price lunch or dinner) plus one glass of champagne (house) and one glass of wine each. As an experience, I'm glad I did it but fortunately I had a $350 gift certificate to cushion the blow to my wallet.A foodies (foody's? - how do you make this possesive? it is definitely possesive) paradise but not for the faint of palate., Okay okay... I know what you're going to say... 3 Stars??? It is a little low - I'll say 3.5. Here's the reason but first I must suck up: I love you Thomas Keller - you have brought happiness to millions of foodies the world over, but when I visited your lovely restaurant in New York, your staff was a little uptight. I dined a year after the restaurant first opened. March 2005. It was almost a little stressful the staff's unease. At the French Laundry, when I have been, the ease and causal elegance of the staff and their service enhanced the experience. The menus are very simular at these two restaurants, and French Laundry which gets a five was so much more enjoyable an experience. It wasn't the company, it wasn't the food - it was the staff. I am a super fan of all things Keller - I hope to dine a per se in the near future, and if the staff has relaxed a bit I'm sure all will be well once again and I will up my stars., Per Se definitely met expectations. We had lunch reservations so the view overlooking Central Park and the city during the day was quite awe inspiring and complemented the overall experience. The food was prepared and presented with such finesse and precision, it was hard to even dig in for that first bite upon laying my sights on the dish as it first arrives. Our wait staff were extremely polite and welcoming. I was actually expecting a really rigid and smothering waiter but he was quite entertaining and offered up every tidbit of knowledge he had pertaining to everything from the olive oil they were so carefully drizzling on top of our dish to the origins and methods of preparation of our wagyu beef. The only odd thing I did notice was that he didn't make too much eye contact, rather allowing his gaze to peer outside through the glass looking right past my friends. I'm ok with that though, I rather be on the receiving end of a more passive glance than an all too intense stare, expecially if I'm eating. Don't forget to try their signature Per Se cocktail which they pour at the table for you. A little on the strong side but quite tasty. Excellent food and atmosphere and overall delightful experience., I went here with my girlfriend during our trip to NYC, let me mention that one of the big reasons we went on that trip was to visit this particular restaurant. I'm in the industry and have worked with a few people of the Keller alumni, such as the current chef at Masa's in SF, so I had to see what it was all about.The atmosphere--stuffy, but I guess all restaurants of this caliber are. The food however was divine, everything I ate felt as if it were dancing in my mouth. The combinations were perfect and the service was spectacular. Everyone knew exactly what they were talking about as if they themselves prepared the food from scratch. I'd definitely go back if I could afford to. :P, 'After all the hype, Per Se is just OK. After trying to make reservations once, we were advised that we had to call exactly two months prior to our desired date at 10am (when they start taking appointments). The woman who took our call was very nice and recommended that if we wanted to select a premium time we should call a bit earlier at around 9:50am. Get ready for a very long meal with a lot of food (3.5-4 hours). The dishes are small, but it was just too much for me. So I advise that if you do not eat too much, then take it easy early so you can taste the entire meal.The food was very good, but I don think it justified the hype. I know the menu changes often, so it just might be a case where we went on an off-day.There were some ridiculous things that made me feel like I was being made fun of (hidden camera anywhere?) like the waiters making a big deal of asparagus that came directly from France. I swear that it tasted just like good l Californian asparagus. At least an A+ for effort in the presentation.Our bill for four people was about $3500 (including wine), and after the meal, I really didn feel like it was worth it.', Per Se is a special experience, with excellent haute cuisine food and excellent service in a great location. It's probably the most creative meal, as well as the most over-the-top and refined meal, I've ever had in NYC. So the crux of a Per Se review comes down to these simple questions: Should I go there? Is it worth the money? Does it deserve five stars? The answer to the first question is yes. If you're prepared to call exactly at 10am on the right date, and prepared to wait 15-30 minutes on the phone, you will get a table. It's no worse than reserving at Babbo. Second, is it worth the money? Again, the answer is yes, presuming you have the money or you're letting someone else pay. However, if you are on a budget, try to steer clear of the sommelier because you will end up spending more on wine than you planned. Third, does it deserve five stars? Compared to almost every other restaurant in NYC, the answer is yes. But compared to the standard it sets for itself, I have to say no. The reason I say no is that dining at Per Se is work. It is not relaxing. You need to be on your best sophisticated behavior. You need to acknowledge that you understand and appreciate what jurassic salt is. You need to converse knowledgeably with the wait staff and be prepared to have each ingredient explained to you for all of the 9 or so courses you are served. All of that can be educational and entertaining, but I also found it to be an effort, a form of work that detracted from my sense of relaxation. I felt like true pleasure shouldn't require so much effort. The other reason I only give it 4 stars is because I felt the decor was kind of sterile, like eating in the lobby of a Ritz-Carlton in Singapore, or in a very stylish airport lounge. That doesn't mean the decor isn't nice, it just means that measured against what Per Se aims to be, which is the ultimate dining experience in NYC, I felt the decor came up a bit short. It made me long for the rustic apple basket that the old Bouley used to have. But when a place aims for perfection, it can almost never measure up, so maybe I'm being too harsh, because in the end it was a great experience and I hope to go back again sometimes, say in 5 or 10 years after I finish digesting the several desserts, petits fours, cookies and chocolates that were served at the end of the meal., I agree with other reviewers who note that it's all about the details while dining at Per Se. Oysters & tapioca...yum. Texas toast served wtih my foie gras...always perfectly buttered & toasted & served warm. I swear to god there is some guy back in the kitchen whose sole basis for employment is the Texas toast. (Ok, it probably has a fancy French name, but really, it's just Texas toast!) The elaborate storytelling surrounding the butter's origins...a bit crazy but totally entertaining. These guys take themselves very seriously. Especially the chocolate truffle guy at the end. Whatever you do, do NOT try to pick out your own chocolate. Let him carefully select the perfect truffle, pick it up with his handy dandy truffle paper between his fingers, and plop it gently onto y our awaiting silver tray. I made the mistake of grabbing my own and you should have heard the gasps of horror. Eesh.I think it was well worth the $250 I paid for the full tasting menu. There is PLENTY of food. However, try to make your rich & famous friends make a reservation for you so you can avoid the ridiculous call 2 months in advance hassle., Quite possibly the best restaurant in New York. Honestly it's hard to even review this...I could describe every course of both of my visits but it's worthless because the menu is always changing and everything is far beyond anything you'd expect. I don't think the $1k pricetag for a dinner for two is too much to ask for. Honestly, call at 10am and reserve a table now for 2 months from now and it'll be worth it. Guaranteed., BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE (not yet fortunate enough to try French Laundry), aka Meal of Death. We're talking 4-5 hours here of gastronomic heaven -- so be prepared for an event. The Foie Gras (x2 actually; terrine and seared) was phenomenal, and the Oyster and Pearl (served with an real mother-of-pearl spoon) was perfection. I loved every moment of it., It was a blur. A gorgeous, gastronomical blur. A perfect Sunday afternoon (their brunch menu is the same as their normal menu)... No but seriously, would I do this regularly? No. I'd be fat. And broke. And did I say fat? Given what I've read in all of his cookbooks, I was actually expecting the portions to be much smaller. Instead I got barraged with wave after wave of innovative perfection on a plate. What truly makes Thomas Keller the man is how he combines his flavors. I mean cauliflower pannacotta with caviar? How would you think of that? And yet it was amazing! The sommelier was truly knowledgeable and very nice. Per se has a great selection of half bottles so you can have white or something light with your fish at the beginning and then revel in a red with your meat later.Aaaahh... now if only he would open a Bouchon Bistro (not bakery) in New York...., Wow. This place is crazy. The view of Central Park, the absolutely flawless service, and the food.I would suggest before going to an event place like this, go out and buy the French Laundry cookbook. You will recognize a lot of what's on the menu, and appreciate how much work and attention to detail goes into the food.A few things to note: This meal will take a long time. Don't have other plans for the night. Also, if you are hungry after the tasting menu, there is probably something wrong with you. Seek medical attention.I'm a bit at a loss of words for this place. Probably because my stomach is growling thinking about it., My (ex)boyfriend brought me here for my birthday last year. I'm a big fan of good food that isnt pretentious and a huge believer that good food should be accessible to everyone. So the idea of Per Se sort of rubbed me a little bit the wrong way. I imagined a stuffy room, silence and old people gasping when I would inevitably drop my fork. And for godsake, its in a MALL. But, all the hype that both my (ex)boyfriend and the internet had built up around it, i'll admit: i was intrigued. Theres no option for the menu here. The only thing to get, is obviously the chef's tasting menu. All. Nine. Courses. And a hint: the menu says 9 courses. it doesn't list that desert is 3 freaking courses (uh after eating 9 full courses) and little amuse bouches inbetween your actual courses. So, don't eat for a week (you'll need the money anyway) and opt in for 9 courses. I can't even go through all the courses here. Theres not even anything to say about them, except that they are completely, ridiculously, delicious. This is FOOD, the way it was MEANT to taste. Every single bite was an experience. Man do i love to complain and i cant find something to bitch about here. And me, being afraid it'd be too stuffy? Nah, its not so bad. Sure, everyone is dressed all sorta fancy but mostly people are there for occasions so it doesnt feel awkward. The staff is extremely knowledgable and if i had dropped my fork i wouldn't have even noticed because they probably would have picked it up and replaced it before i even noticed. They're not snooty at all and very very nice. I guess my only complaint is the 2 month waiting list and price. Worth it though, if you want to go through the trouble.Also remember to grab some cash for a cab home. You won't be able to walk.PS-- Tour of the kitchen is awesome if you get lucky-- which we got! Its SPOTLESS and there really IS a tv with a live stream linking the kitchen in California to the one in NY! Cool!, 'A truly amazing experience, which I highly recommend to anyone who indulges in all their faculties and on a brazenly, ostentatious level.  I do not mean to sound too pretentious, but this is what conjured, once ushered into this habitat. I will not even attempt an explanation once inside this establishment, you must simply experience this on your own. I will say this, it is a form of entertainment that is comparable to say, a shark attack or a sex act. You just can take your eyes off of what happening in front of you.  I know, I know...Ie heard that it tuff nut to crack. What, with the hassle of scoring reservations. But if you are tenacious enough, it really ends up being well worth it. I swear, just hang in there and someone will answer your call. As for this steep price of dining that makes everyone a wee bit tetchy. This is what I do to solve this problem. I put about $2.00 away every day for about a year. By the end of this year, I have about $700.00 saved and if I go over budget, (it happens) it doesn hurt as much.  It not like you are going to dine at this restaurant on a weekly basis. It almost like going to the circus or the ballet, once a year is enough. It loses it pizzazz when frequented more than this and that makes you jaded, which is thoroughly pretentious.', Call me a philistine, but I'm not a rabid fan of Keller's food. Not that it was bad, but I didn't think it was so much more inventive or better executed than, say, Bouley, or another place that maybe doesn't cost you a month's rent (hey, I live in the TL, rent is cheap).Yes, the service is good. My dinner companion was suffering from a hangover and voila! The waiter presents him with two pills on a silver tray. The dishes came out at the perfect temperature, timing was good, the atmosphere was understated luxury, they send you home w/ a cute little package of macaroons, as duly noted by enthusiastic fans everywhere. :P You can read a ton of detailed reviews on chowhound. Unfortunately for me, I could care less that the foie gras came from a duck specially fattened on human milk in the highest mountains of Tibet, or that I was partaking of caviar hand harvested by twenty blind nuns. The food was on the salty side and nothing really wowed my crude taste buds. Oh, except for the desserts -- the truffles, the chocolate, the sorbet, even the candies were all very good. But again, not so much more so than what you'd find at any good restaurant in NYC. Oh well. I've only been once, so this review is not to be taken seriously. In my not-so-humble opinion, I think you should go for the theater of the meal, not necessarily the food itself. Or better yet, just pay your rent on time this month. :), 'There is no denying that this is NYC best restaurant. Granted I have only been to a few but I cannot imagine a better experience. And that is the best way to summarize Per Se, an experience.I am a vegetarian and I am used to eating pretty bad food, at otherwise fantastic restaurants. The vegetarian tasting menu was beyond this world. I was even tempted by my wife carnivore menu. But there was so much food coming that I barely had time to look at what she was getting.The service was impeccable. The presentation was outstanding. The food was worth the cost.There was a lot of giggling throughout the meal because we could not believe the ingredients. White truffles, followed by black truffles. But wait before we serve you those truffles, let us make a show of the presentation.I see some people here were put off by the oppulence and by the stuffiness. Get over it! You are paying good money, enjoy the show!Wel be going back....but first we will have to save some money!', How amazing can it get? This is it people.Truly an experience. and the best part other than the food of course was service and atmosphere. It was NOT stuffy at all. Everyone was so nice, not snobby like some other places. And what a great view. I think my review will be too long if I get into each course. But man, this was my first time having caviar (pearls and Oysters) so delicious and also foie gras. I've had a little taste here and there of my husband's because I was always so scared to order it at other restaurants but man, it was SOOOoo delicious here. So rich and delicate and just explodes in your mouth good. I kept thinking about it days after having dinner here.Course after course was spectacular from oysters, foie gras, scallops, tuna, duck, rib eye, and desserts.Definitely worth going once in your life. You will never see food the same way again.Also go with someone really special and make it an event =)One more thing. great thing is service is included!, 'I went to Per Se for my birthday this year, and it was on the short list of restaurants we had to try before we left New York, and I glad we went.The price? This is a lot like one of those if you have to ask how much a yacht costs things. It expensive. And would you get a better investment by eating at Howard Johnson 20 times versus eating here once? If youe the kind of person who needs to think that through, save your money. I not trying to be a snob, but if you can just take the hit for the big experience, youe going to overthink things.The food? I have to admit, I am an Indiana-raised, meat-and-potatoes guy. I don eat caviar. I don like raw fish. My only experience with stinky cheese is throwing out year-old Velveeta I forgot about. So I didn go into this thinking wow, this is going to be the most appetizing meal since the Bacon Double Cheeseburger! The food was weird. It was amazing, stunning, bizarre, interesting, and questionable. I was given eating utensils I never seen in my life. And everything was just a couple of bites, so I tried everything, and sucked it up if it was something so bizarre I couldn tell what it was.The service is so over the top it ridiculous. Imagine the number of people that would be in an operating theater during a brain transplant, double that, and that the number of front-of-house people that are attending to your party of two. Seriously. Everyone was ultra-nice, answered all of my dumb questions with extreme interest, and before you even thought that something was missing or needed to be topped off, it was.Was this my best meal ever? Probably not, at least in comparing food to food. Was it one of the most interesting experiences of my life? Definitely.', Yes, it was me who had the temerity to give Chef Keller's French Laundry only four stars.I didn't do it to piss people off or to be different (that was a bonus).I didn't do it because I'm a jaded food snob.I did it because Per Se is what my French Laundry experience should have been... and if that wasn't THE most highbrow, fussbudget, and uppity sentence ever uttered, I don't know what is.Like French Laundry, the food is top-notch... not even I will argue that. What made this experience was the service and ambiance. If I'm gonna spend some serious dough, I wanna see/feel/taste/smell where my hard-earned money's going. Everything about the Per Se experience builds up to the inevitable conclusion that big things are about to happen:-It starts with walking into the Time Warner Center, a monolithic edifice for the glamorous and moneyed.-You step on to the escalator and make your way to the 4th floor, rising slowly as if you are ascending to heaven itself.-When you reach the restaurant, you must cross a small garden. A freakin' garden in the middle of the Time Warner Center!!! Did I just smell lilac???-The Star Trek glass doors slide aside whisper quiet to welcome you into another world.The interior is everything you'd expect and more. You get the white linens, the ultramodern decor, and an outrageous view of Columbus Circle and Central Park. Yep, you know where the money's going.What happened to wifey and me for the next 4 hours was obscene. Absolutely filthy, debaucherous, and outright pornographic. We're not proud of it, but Chef Keller had his way with us and we're now his bitches forever., We had an amazing, perfect, unbelievable, unforgettable night at Per Se.The food was out of this world: perfectly prepared, exciting to the eyes, the nose, and the palette. Every dish was delicious, plated well, served at the right temperature, and beautifully presented.The service was phenomenal, maybe the best we've ever had. The staff were courteous, extremely flexible, unfailingly polite, going out of their way to please us. But they were not overbearing, rushing, or aggressive in any way.You would expect this level of food and service for the price you pay, but at Per Se you actually get it., BEST MEAL EVER. I've had a lot of unbelievable dining experiences in my life, in some pretty amazing places in this world, but this experience I gotta say was by far the best. I spent 9 years in San Francisco and never once got around to eating Thomas Keller's food. But last March I finally popped my cherry at Per Se in celebration of writing the New York bar exam. We had an 11:30 reservation for lunch on a Saturday. We walked out of there at 4:30. Such a fantastic afternoon! We ate we drank we laughed and we were rendered speechless more than once by the genius that is Thomas Keller. From the moment we walked in, we felt like royalty. The service was impeccable, the food orgasmic and the entire experience well worth the $500 a head we paid. The room itself is so simple and elegant. Two story ceilings with a view of Columbus Circle and Central Park from just above the trees. There's a gorgeous fireplace and I imagine that at night, with a fire going and that view- the room must be absolutely magical! Hell, even the bathrooms were sexy! I wish I had written down everything we ate that day- I can no longer remember the details, but I do remember I ordered the foie gras upgrade. And in the middle of that course, they replenished my brioche toasts with a fresh warm batch and took away the stuff that had cooled off. Now that's service! We also went with the wine pairings which I highly recommend. Really- if you're going to do it, you gotta do it right! Go big or go home, my friend! Every pairing was perfect. Of course we started with a bottle of champagne first- it went perfectly with our complimentary caviar course. And for all you vegetarians out there that think it's a waste of money to drop $200 on an all-vegetable prix fixe menu, I say GO TO PER SE!!! One of my friends ordered the vegetarian menu and we were all stunned! Every course was absolutely brilliant! Some of them were even better than the carnivore version. Who would have thought one could do so many incredible things with vegetables!!! The man is pure genius, I tell you!This is really an experience to be had at least once in your life! I'd go back in a heartbeat, if only I had a job..., 'Everyone should eat here at least once in their life. $300 to feel like royalty and get waited on hand and foot is not a bad idea considering two hours in the Mandarin Hotel VIP suite is $1k plus. The thing about per se is, you have to be curious and talkative. If youe read about a dish, say Keller donuts and coffee, and it not on the menu. Ask the waiter about it and they will bring it to you. Ask about the silverware and plates, and theyl bring you a catalogue and tell you where you can buy it in nyc. Tell them it your birthday and theyl print Happy Birthday your name  on the menu. Can finish all the candies and truffles at the end of dinner, ask if you can take it home and they will happily oblige. Everything you want, they will provide so don be shy. As for the food, everything is prepared perfectly but whether it will wow you depends on what you want. I personally like to experience new flavors and combinations, so with the exception of the oyster and pearls and the white truffle risotto, everything was familiar, although elevated in taste.Compare this with another restaurant of this caliber, Pierre Gagnaire, I prefer PG. But to each own.', OK, I hate to be the voice of dissent, but I really don't like this place. Maybe it was because my mom and I showed up without reservation but we were not treated well by the staff. We were seated immediately, but it took our waiter 15 minutes to even approach us and ask us what we wanted to drink. When we finally got our appetizers they were cold and our entrees were rubbery and not good. When we tried to talk to management about it, we were brushed off. NOT a good experience, especially for the price., This wasn't just dinner, it was an experience. All of the dishes were very good, and a few were dishes that I'll remember for the rest of my life (oysters and pearls, the wagyu beef, coffee and donuts).The service was impeccable - the wait staff was charming and accommodating. At the end of our meal, the host gave us a tour of the kitchen., 'Number 100. It a big deal, no?As some of you already know, my cardinal rule about Yelping is that I don do it until Ie visited at least twice, or if the experience was, say, once in a lifetime.This would apply to the former.-----Having come from the Bay Area I noticed immediately that this place was a callback to the French Laundry: the blue door, the lantern markings, the table settings, the warmth and hospitality of the staff. It the same restaurant in spirit but the translation of it into a metropolitan space is what made it so exciting. Not to mention the view of Central Park South while you enjoy cocktails -- could you ask for a more relaxing way to start an evening?Once you sit down it an entirely different ball game. Smiles and drinks and menus, it all seems to happen so fast. But by the time your meal begins to appear in front of you, you forget the fuss; you forget everything else and you see the big picture. This is a three-star Michelin restaurant for a reason. This is the epitome of you get what you pay for.And it really the little things that add up about this place, from never having to worry about your water or wine, to never having to worry about your food being sub-par, to never having to... well, never having to do anything except for stuff your face. And as you merrily go along accomplishing that task of nine courses you see about thirty different people on the floor doing something: folding a napkin for someone who got up; taking off the cloche from a plate to reveal caviar; pouring wine into a decanter; presenting truffles in a box or hundred-year-old aged balsamic vinegar; lines of people carrying food and plates to and from the kitchen.It a scene right out of the Michelin reviewer dream as they nosh ever so sinfully on lobster gussied up as acaroni and cheeseand play with their canapes when they get presented with what is essentially salmon tartare in a cone.The first time was just as good as the second, and hearkens back to my first foray into ridiculously fine dining from the French Laundry. Clean flavors equal clean plates. Good wine equals good times. And good company in a good space makes the sum greater than the parts.For a restaurant to be so thoughtful about the little things makes one realize that the time put into the big things was just as awesome to their devotion over the little ones. From coat check to receiving the check, you aren in New York City. Youe at Per Se. Youe in and of yourself, contained in contentment, happy to be detached from the hubbub. Do it when you can. It worth it every time.', 'Ok, here the deal. Most human beings will NEVER be able to afford to go to Per Se. Now, don let this fact embitter you. I had heard about how stuffy and insanely priced this place was, and decided I wouldn go there until I won the lottery.Well, I didn win the lottery, but I was however given an unexpected opportunity to go here on someone else dime--and I didn even have to put out (it was my friend boyfriend who wanted to impress his new girlfriend influential and judgemental friend). Given the chance again, I wouldn pick any other restaurant.Let just say, I approved of my friend boyfriend wholeheartedly after being taken to Per Se. And this guy could not have been more wrong for her. It was criminal how wrong.But for a few hours, he seemed like Zeus, whispering to the waiters, motioning with his hand this way and that way.Little round puffs of pastry bursting like a gusher candy with warm gooey creaminess--just pop em right in your mouth.Plenty of big spoonfuls of large egg caviar. Whatever is the most expensive kind you can imagine. THIS was the first time I actually have tasted caviar and liked it.A beautiful nest of fettuccine made by magical pasta elves just minutes before hand. Then a captain with a grater and a big black truffle shaved, dusted, and sprinkled for what seemed like days, a thick black snowblanket of truffle as far as the eye could see. A black winter wonderland. Mouthgasm. Just had one. Cheese from a farm where there are only SEVEN cows (I not kidding on this one)Teeny tiny little savory ice cream cones with a dollop of salmon tartar and creme fraiche--delightful!Too many desserts to count--but really--can one have too many desserts? I think NOT...I don remember all the details of the other 5 courses. I was pretty much already drunk since every course had it its own wine or champaign pairing--and where I come from--if it on the table--you drink it. I felt a tad out of place I must admit, but in a couple years theyl know my face well...The waiters are a bit like the guards at Buckingham--they will NOT laugh at your jokes whatsoever. But it certainly fun to try to mess with them.When I go to heaven, er, if, lunch will be catered by Per Se every other Wednesday.', 'This is a nice dining experience in N.Y. for discerning foodies like myself, it would get a five if the reservation is a little easier though. Ask your hotel concierge to help, it worked out beautifully.', Look, there's already plenty of gushing about the food, so you should get the general idea - and the food does in fact live up to any gushing you've heard - so I'll talk about the booze.First a disclaimer that my recollections are hazy - no, not from the booze- because the whole experience was like (and here I wish I could think of a more masculine equivalent to this analogy) Cinderella at the ball (dude, stop snickering - they talk about cinderalla during march madness all the time- it's totally butch). so there may be a tiny bit of exaggeration on some of the numbers.As we waited for our table (I think the earliest reservation we could get was like 10pm? 11pm? 1am?) a waiter came over to take our cocktail order. He recited the menu and it was like Hogwarts meets grown up drinking - gold infused champagne with grenadine huckleberry and sasparilla root, vodka with northpole snow garnish? I skipped over the home made goldschlager and ordered a Gin and Tonic with home made tonic - yup, they made their own bicarbonate of soda or whatever it is that one does for tonic. It was surreal -good surreal. really good.When we sat down for dinner and went to order a bottle of wine, I had a moment of pause. As a married dude, it's my socially prescribed role to order a bottle of wine - and do it with elan. or without embarassing every one at the table. I'm not a wine geek, but I can usually accomplish this duty without a big fuss and with decent results.But, I was a little daunted by the prices and the sheer number of pages. I asked the waiter for a recommendation and it was like having Charlie Rose as your personal shopper - he asked a few questions, didn't snort at my price range, and had that Rose way of making the guest seem like the most interesting, savvy intelligent human since Copernicus. Most importantly, he picked a $65 bottle of wine that was out of sight, and totally to our tastes.somewhere around 3 AM we got through the third dessert course - i know it's a seven course tasting menu, but I swear it was like 15 - they arrived with our take home goody bags (desert #4, course 19) Any way, I'd give it like 49 hundred stars, if only Yelp would let me be fuzzy on that number too., i went to per se with my family last friday for a belated lunar new year celebration. the outside garden was tastefully done, more so than the interior. i didn't quite get the mix of red tulips and white roses as a centerpiece which i'm sure was a remnant from v-day. thankfully the 10 course chef's tasting menu out did the decor. almost every course from the goat cheese puffs to the smooth goose foie-gras to the intricate rabbit ribs was delectable. our waiter was extremely attentive and a fine sommelier. my only ever so slight criticism was the ultra heavy chocolate gateau (my sweet tooth is tres petit n'est-ce pas?) and the regret that i missed the chance of dining at french laundry due to final exam during college., Exceptional. Fine dining and fine service. Worth every penny (although, truth be told, I didn't pay.) Only downside (not enough to lose a star, though) is that you have to go through a mall to get to it. Escalators and fine dining for me don't typically go hand in hand, but if Chef Keller wants me to ride an escalator under white light to get to him, so be it., Incredible experience. I went with my (now) ex-colleague and we both enjoyed the food and the setting. We are both foodies who love and live the SATC life (wink, wink).Having grown up in London, French food is not entirely new to me, but this was ethereal. We had an incredible table, best suited for couples, with straight views of Central Park. Arguably the most romatic place in the city!I will return soon. I owe my neighbors a fancy dinner, and Per Se is definitely on my shortlist of places to take them, on my expense account. And when I take my friends out for dinner, the 1995 Petrus will flow liberally, and I would buy them the best that money can offer. I mean, Per Se!p.s. my charming neighbour and friend (Srini) wrote this review on my behalf...and as you can tell he is very SATC too (and high maintenance....1995 Petrus says it all)...but that's not to say that I wouldn't induldge in VCP La Grande Dame on special occasions! ;), 'Like a beautifully choreographed ballet, this dining experience is worth every penny of the BIG CHUNK OF CASH you have to part with in dining here. Our tasting menu including extraordinary options such as a Caviar and Oyster Tapioca (sounds gross but was amazing); a Shirley Temple Sorbet and a Salmon Tartar that was out of this world. The portions aren large but the full factor sneaks up on you. Go hungry!', Very nice experience. All the exceptional reviews this restaurant received were well justified. Per se set the bar for fine dining in New York. I don't care to reiterate how fabulous this place is. Problems I have: 1. Portions are too small and too desert heavy. I was slight unsatisfied at the end of the regular tasting menu, until the servers started to bring out ridiculous amount of sweet treats. It felt like the deserts were there for over compensation.  2. Wine pairing would work perfectly with the tasting menu, which they do not offer. In order to have wines to compliment all courses, you may need at least 3 varietals. Not thoughtful. 3. It's inferior to French Laundry. I expected more., april fooooools lol!I'm sure you are 5 stars Per Se and hope one day to eat at you., Full disclaimer: I'm obsessed with Thomas Keller. Well, maybe not in a weird, clinical-diagnosis-kind-of-way, but I'm sure you, kind reader, will understand how life can be influenced simply by what you eat.I reserved a table two years ago with my then-girlfriend (now my wife), and the memory of that meal is more significant than anything else that I try to recall. It's one of those places that's a little bit larger than life, and you really need to go with someone you love or at least a set of really really good friends to simply enjoy yourselves. Each course that night was so pleasant; a fluid ballet of tastes and textures, witticisms and pragmatism, and conveying a genuine sense of care and luxuriousness.I could go on about the courses, but many other reviewers have touched upon them already, so I'll just give this one tip about the tables: Make a late reservation (I know, it's already daunting enough to get a darn table as it is, much less set your own time!) because I just thought it was so cool when they gave us a tour of the kitchen, the expediting area, and the wine room since we were the only ones left!, One place that should not be missed, if you can afford it! Super pricey but totally worth it once in your lifetime. My husband and I ate here on our honeymoon back in September 2006. Located in the Time Warner building, on the 3rd or 4th floor, huge picture windows look out at the south west corner of Central Park.We had the regular prix fix menu, as opposed to the vegetarian menu. My husband also opted for the additional fee for the fois gras (his favourite!). The food was exceptionally prepared, as one would expect. The wait staff were very attentive and the view was beautiful.We've also eaten at Thomas Keller's French Laundry in Napa Valley, CA and we found Per Se much tastier and more memorable.Be aware that it is pretty difficult to get reservations. We had to call exactly 2 months prior to the date that we wanted to eat there, first thing in the morning, which is pretty early since will live in OC and they are on east coast time. We still couldn't get dinner reservations because they were all booked up so we ended up with the first seating which was 11:30. The menu is very extensive and we were there for 3 hours, we may have been super slow, but at 11 dishes, including the amuse bouches, that's alot of food in the middle of the day., 'Soooo, I thinking about writing a book about my dining experience at Per Se. It will be titled 101 Ways to Describe Per(Se)fection. I was truly blown away. I found myself complimenting every single aspect of my meal there--the food, the service, the ambiance, the presentation and the little things they do to make you feel special. Everything was absolutely perfect. Calling the food Delicious felt like an understatement. Nice would have been such a plain description. McDonald can be described as nice and to call Per Se the same would just be downright offensive. To describe the food with such mediocre terms, I would be a disgrace to fellow Foodies the world over.So back to the book, itl be formatted with one word per page. It will and should be brought to Per Se for a meal. As every course is brought out, the reader/diner will open the book to a random page and the word will accurately describe their dish. Think like The Book of Answers except adjectives to describe your experience.So far there are 15 words -- Perfect. Execellent. Phenomenal. Astounding. Amazing. Awesome. Divine. Incredible. Outstanding. Terrific. Fantastic. Wonderful. Fabulous. Superb. Heavenly. Of course therel be slang words! Tight. Legit. Money. Legal. ill. Shiznit (ie. This Salmon with Creme Fraiche amuse bouche is the shiznit!)I still taking submissions for words. After all the words therel be mini chapters such as.. If you ask nicely, they will give it to you to describe the service and how much they go out of their way to please you (ie. asking for a second helping of amuse bouches and a second round of chocolate) if you tell them that youe there for a special occasion, they print personalized menus for you and your dining party. Another important chapter will be dedicated to the difference between spring and fall flavors. With the Fall flavors being all about truffles, risotto, heavier sauces and meats and the Spring being lighter with a lot of fish and poultry. (Though of course this definitely could change as Per Se menu changes daily, to be covered in the chapter called It different every time.)I haven yet decided if therel be a section for medicore words like Nice, Delicious and Good. I might put it in for the people that were unimpressed by the food. If this chapter will be in my book though, itl be all the way in the back as the spotlight of the book is how truly amazing Per Se is. All book proceeds will go to my Per Se dining fund.Thank you.', 'Perfect in every way. Having dined here 5 or 6 times now, I have yet to be disappointed. Last night was the capper. After having planned a special dinner there for a friend 40th for the last several months, my wife came down with a horrible flu. This weekend all the way across the country had been planned for 4 months. The email traffic with the restaurant numbered into the 20s making sure all the details were set. And now the flu. We couldn go. The dinner went on of course for our friends, but the restaurant actually had a messenger delivery a bag of goodies to our hotel across town with a nice get well note included. Having dined at many of the best restaurants in the country, I can loudly proclaim that the service here and at the mother ship in Yountville is at a level I have yet to see ANYWHERE else. Perfect service before arrival, perfect service while in the dining room, and a new one to us. Perfect service even when we couldn make it.Thomas Keller and his staff are true super stars. They make everyone feel special and this one topped it off for us.A truly special place', 'Per Se - Thomas Keller - Gourmet CuisineThese words seem to go together quite well. I ate here recently with a small group of family.Lets start with decor and ambiance. The Time Warner building is visually stunning. The restaurant just fits here. The tables are well spaced - so even a more noisy group will not ruin that special evening for someone else. True to form the waitstaff is impeccably dressed and the apertif list is robust.The prix fixe menu has some subtle and tasty combinations. What draws me to taste at the country top restaurants is a chef innovation with cuisine - the combination of seemingly odd ingredients to combine flavors (the combination - or symbosis) of which is something completely new and different - and utterly enjoyable. My very favorite technique is to combine the familiar with the exotic. Thomas Keller does this well. The food was quite good. I will end it there. The supplements (foie gras and white truffle risotto) were very over priced and very mediocre. The dishes were good sized - for that setting, but the flavors were often too subtle to enjoy and the accompanying sauces to sparse to fully savor. The wine pairings were also not to my liking. Although I am sure this is a function of taste. The gewurtztraminer we started with was too sweet for its food pairing - a subtle scallop dish (although this often works when scallops are seared quite well) and what irritated me most was the Syrah pairing with the Lamb (although the lamb was quite good). Where as the first wine was too strong this was - by its very character - too weak. All the intermezzo were very nice and well done - maybe even my favorite part of the event.Dessert was fantastic as was the port we had with it (Grahams 88 - I believe).In summation: This restaurant is very, very good. It is also ridiculously expensive. Neither the obsequiousness of the waitstaff nor the notoriety of Mr. Keller surpass that hurdle of dollars and cents. I have not had the opportunity to dine at French Laundry - but have heard it is better (although quite different).My recommendation would be to bypass this NYC classic and head straight to Cafe Gray (in the same building) which is the best meal I have ever had in NYC.', Went here with the family and had a great time. I can't even remember how many courses came out, but they were all delicious and presented perfectly. Not having to pay makes it even that much better, ha ha ha., We went as a larger group. The food was good but not great but the service was excellent. However, for what you are paying the food should be perfect too. I am happy that I went but I won't go back., Had to review this place!Got a reservation for the same night due to a cancellation! We were SO excited and and everything turned out AAAMAZING! We ordered some fantastic wines too, so it was all veeery expensive, but totally worth it even if I can't eat out for the next 3 months!Taste: 9/10Presentation: 5/5Creativity: 4/5Wine selection: 5/5Total 23/25, 'By far the best meal (and best service) of my life. And trust me- I eat a lot of good food at a lot of amazing restaurants.It was a little weird walking through a mall and going up escalators to get to such an upscale restaurant, but as soon as we walked through the doors we nearly forgot that we were even in Manhattan. Everything about the decor is pristine and invokes relaxation. When we were seated, I was completely breathless due to the beautiful view of the park. So much so that i sort of gasped out a little yes, please when our server asked if it was ok if he put my purse on a little footstool (how thoughtful! I always irritated when I have to put my expensive bags on the floors of restaurants).So, the food. Man, where do I start? We had the chef tasting menu (the longest of the options). after ordering we were brought the little salmon tartar cones of French Laundry fame. They were perfect (as was everything). To drink I had dry vodka martinis (which turned out to be a great choice, as they were wonderful cocktails and they didn interfere with the food at all) however, they do have an amazing wine list.Everything we ate was amazing, but the standouts in my memory are:Foie Gras-best foie gras Ie ever had. it was served with spring onions a little drizzle of olive oil and sea salt and warm brioche bread. the serving was quite large and I took my sweet time enjoying it. when I was halfway done, a server brought me new bread because my other slice had gotten cold!Poached Nova Scotia Lobster-perfectly prepared, super flavorful, beautiful. Saddle of rabbit-delicious (no surprise)Desserts-I lost count of the desserts they brought us, but they were all stunning. I got to a point where I was so full it hurt to eat, but everything was so good, i couldn stop eating. That what I call beautiful agony.It wasn cheap, but it was worth every penny. Eating at Per Se was the highlight of my week in NYC.', I don't know how he did it, but he managed to get a reservation here for 8pm tonight. And we didn't even decide to come here until this afternoon. But once I knew, the expectations started to build; after all, this is a Thomas Keller Michelin Guide 3-star restaurant.Well, despite the lofty expectations, this place still completely blew me away.The restaurant is on the top floor of the Warner Center, with a gorgeous view of the trees within Central Park as well as the NY skyscrapers in the background. The modern decor is understated but extremely elegant - simply gorgeous. The tables are situated far enough apart that each table's conversation is kept private.I had the Tasting Menu, substituting a few items from the Vegetarian Menu. Each item was presented beautifully, tasted delicious, all with dreamy texture. But the Nova Scotia Lobster was especially memorable. The lobster was presented whole, with incredible texture and tasted so sweet that I actually closed my eyes to savor each bite. And the truffle mushrooms... ohhhh... they tasted like perfectly cooked abalone. I can go on and on.The service, just as everyone has said, was absolutely impeccable. Attentive without being over-bearing.Finally, we were escorted into the kitchen for a tour of the operation, from where the courses were being prepared, to the preparation room, the pastry room, the special private dining room kitchen, the bakery, the chocolate room, etc. There was even a flat panel screen where you can see the kitchen at The French Laundry. What an incredible treat.This was certainly an evening that I will not forget., 'Per Se vs. French Laundry(Latin: By Itself)Definitely a restaurant in a class by itself. Both Per se and French Laundry are run by Thomas Keller.', So good, it really is the kind of experience that must be treasured only once every few years. Be prepared for the meal to take three hours, and those of us that do not possess limitless appetites must pace ourselves. For the first five or six courses, I would recommend only eating a fraction of the serving ... otherwise, it is hard to really enjoy the meat and dessert courses. Dessert was the weakest of all of the courses (we had a peach sorbet served with a pink peppercorn meringue, and a chocolate dessert served with a salty peanut cream), although the chocolates that were served as a post script were delicious. The service was perfect; three hours later, the madctre d' remembered my boyfriend's name and wished him goodnight personally on our way out. One of the waitstaff, Chris, presented us with ten different chocolates at the end of our meal ... I asked him what the most popular flavor was, which he took to mean that I did not spot one of my favorites in the bunch (which really was not at all how I meant my question). When he asked me what my dream flavors would be, my boyfriend and I suggested mint, peanut butter and hazelnut. Three minutes later, he presented us with those exact chocolates! The venue is as good as could be expected for being on the fourth floor of what is essentially a shopping mall. Those who want a truly amazing view of Central Park from the Time Warner Center should get a drink upstairs on the 35th Floor at the Lobby Lounge (part of the Mandarin Oriental, which is part of the complex.) I will be digesting this meal for the days to come, but the memories of the experience will literally last a lifetime., As usual they did it again! I had the best experience ever! I called and was wait listed for a table for two on a Saturday Afternoon. They were able to get us in at the last minute and still had time to specially engrave a dinner menu for our special occasion!The service was beyond exceptional! They added on a few more menu items that we mentioned in passing that we were dreaming about from our french laundry experience! It was a miracle that in 10 minutes they could create the Mexican Donut extravaganza!!!! I love Thomas Keller and his whole staff! They toured us all around Per Se....and I never wanted to leave! i can't wait to go again., 'The ultimate. Other people will write better, more thorough reviews, but I just had to add that this the *ultimate*! Definitively better than French Laundry and Joel Robuchon (Vegas). So many aspects that were superlative, but what gets me really tingly was the house-made tonic served with the gin and tonic I had. I mean the attention to detail from start to finish makes you think you have died and gone to heaven.', 'I am a little embarrassed to tell friends how much we have spent on a meal here, but it is worth every penny. We spent nearly 5 hours there and I would have gone back the next night if I could. As others have said, it is the definition of perfection in every aspect of a culinary experience...creativity, execution, presentation, service, atmosphere and the intangible sense that you are the most special guest they have in their restaurant that night. Per se and French Laundry are the peaks against which I judge other fine dining restaurants. So far, no others compare.'|3
41|quince-san-francisco|Go here and go here now. This restaurant is awesome. The home made pastas are insane. The setting is old world in an old 1800's pharmacy and its worth it just to see the inside. The service is great. It can be a bit noisy and its a bit expensive but i loved it. Great date place.update: 1/22/07the food got better..i cant believe it..butternut squash ravioli, sirloin steak..amazing..maybe one of the best meals i have ever had, It's embarrasing to recommend, because this restaurant is the newest it place in the country. Featured in every gourmet magazine last year... But it's good! And the atmosphere is bay area chill. You know, everyone is uber-cool but they try and deflect it with their nerdy glasses and witty t-shirts. I highly recommend getting someone with lots of money to take you there. You'll like them so much more afterwards., 'Otherworldly house made pasta, wonderful service, and a romantic room. Delicious', 'Perfect for an intimate date of multiple courses! The housemade pasta is amazing, as is everything else. The husband/wife team is very welcoming. This is a definite must!!!', I can't think of anything negative to say about Quince and that shocks me. Try the lardo - perfect ribbons of pork fat to smear on crostini like butter. And if you are waiting for a table, you can hop over to Cafe Majestic for an aperitif., Seriously, it was good, but not that great, especially for the money. I've had such better food in the city for far less. Plumpjack, Gary Danko and Jack Falstaff all put it to shame in my opinion., I had dinner there tonight before the ballet. Perhaps I was dreading the ballet or maybe I wasn't used to dining out as early as 6:30pm...The atmosphere in the restaurant was quite stuffy... I was split on the first course---the Frito Misto Halibut Cheeks was excellent!!! But the White Asparagus and Fried Egg Yolk was quite scary..it came with two slices of burned bacon floating in grease. The second and third course were middle of the road. They did provide excellent service by its full staff including the friendly owner who personally checked in on every table., Excellent food, with an italian influence, in a very warm and comforting setting. Chef Michael Tusk, who has experience with Chez Pannise's Alice Waters, prepares dishes with tremendous variety. And with a 3 course menu, you have a lot of options. Although my girlfriend and I each had 2 courses and shared a 3rd pasta course. Note that reservations are needed a few weeks in advance, so plan ahead., 'To sum it up: MOMONEY, MOMONEY, MOMONEY!! If youe lucky enough to have gotten a reservation a month or two prior, this is how your evening might be. You arrive at Quince front door and the valet are ready to take your car (better be a Euro import!) to get you onto your fairytale dining experience. Interior is conservative yet tasteful: lights dimmed low but can still see the food, hanging photos or paintings of fruit (if I recall correctly), plush seating etc., all very clubby. Patrons are very Thurston Howell the 3rd!! The wait staff is tactically efficient, yet distant. Wine list is good (MOONEY!!). You have a composed salad for starters and then Halibut or maybe Risotto, which will be tasty (MOMONEY!!). Ambiance will be good, youl be able to talk with your dining companion without having to yell. Total dining experience: better have your black AmEx ready. Sum it up: There are better Italian restaurants in the city with less ude. For the money you can do better than this Chez Panisse wannabe! In fact, just go to Chez Panisse. UPDATE: Ok so yes this place should be renamed SNOOTY JOE, but it better than Chez Panisse. Went to Chez Panisse cafe and was horribly disappointed. MORT! Though I respect the tradition and histoire de Chez Panisse, it time they reinvented their soon to be square wheel.', 'One of the best new restaurants SF has seen in several years. Very well thought of wine list and the food is meticulously prepared, pairing wonderful flavors and the space is very homey. Wish it was a bit easier getting a reservation, though.', 'Ah! What a treat. Amazing service. Each morsel was delicious. The venue was beautiful. Wine list is great. Enjoy!!', Gotta feel like this is one of those Emperor's new clothes sort of places where people get overly excited bout the one or two good things the place does and makes it out to be the most amazing thing since pre-fab frappucinos. Yes, the pasta is absolutely extraordinary. Yes, the service is impeccable and exceedingly gracious. Yes its difficult to procure a rezzie. Yes, the wine list, though small, rocks mightily. Still, the meat dishes were just barely acceptable, and the much vaunted stinging nettle custard (while ok tasty) looked as if the kitchen had plated up the sort of thing my golden retriever yarfs up from time to time. Is it an excellent restaurant--yes, you'll have a very nice time here, it's romantic, the food is pretty damn good. But is it amazing? Can't say it is. I'll make it a point to drop in every once in a long while, but this just doesn't make my list of all-time faves in this great city of ours., My husband celebrated our anniversary dinner at Quice last year and it was good. The nettle sformato was excellent, as were the pastas: bigoli with goose, and tortelloni with porcini mushrooms. The duck entree was cold and we sent it back. Was ok, tasted too much like Thanksgiving with cabbage and pumpkin. Cheese plate was delicious. Service attentive. They have a chef's table which is great for private parties or special meals.I know Michael Tusk brought over the Chez Panisse heritage but I wasn't overwhelmed. Will have to go back and see if my opinion changes next visit., 'So much hype, such overcooked food. The ambiance was beautiful, but how does anyone screw up sea bass?', 'Ridiculous food. They have something for everyone (meat, fish, pasta, cheese, poultry, vegetables) and it all tastes good. Sauces are rich but not too oily, the meats were perfectly cooked. Great wine list as well with choices by the glass, half-bottle, and full bottle. Service was outstanding: waters were refilled quickly, when our candle blew out it was relit, and the wait staff was unobtrusive. It is expensive but perfect for a special meal.', Went here with three girlfriends. We didn't get shushed by anyone and they let us stay way pretty late despite a line at the door. Ambiance is good. Parking is a pain, but doable. Food is excellent, but not five-stars excellent. There was nothing memorable about the food experience. The wait staff does seem unengaged with the dining experience. I'd go back, but there's other places I'd go first., 'This is a very intimate fine dining resturant. the menu changes daily. we went with a party of six and each person was very happy with everything that they ordered-three courses and dessert. the waiter was very good and well informed w/ regard to the menu. for a nice night where your main event is dinner - this is a great choice.', Literally down the block from my house. The absolute best food I have ever had in my life. Must have reservations. This isn't your stop by and hope for a table. It's always full to capacity. Only downside is that if you want to sit at the chef's table you need to make your reservation exactly 30 days in advance (when they open up the list). I've tried to get that table a couple of times and always failed., This place is AMAZING. It is only a block from my house and I wish I could afford to eat there everynight ( and be famous enough to get a reservation every night). It is always booked so call at least 3 weeks in advance if not more. I came here for my birthday ( the max in the dining room is 6 people) and we all tried different things off the 3 course menu. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! The menu changes daily so I can't wait to try new stuff the next time I am fortunate enough to go back. It is a very small european feeling restaurant and I have a hard time believing anyone will leave unsatisfied., Quince offers a gracious, competent, and upretentionus staff, quietly elegant decor, and nice food. But is any resturaunt in the world worth a four month wait ? It may have been worth it just to watch my incredibly stubborn date unhinged in a weighty philosophical battle with one of his good friends. I had the good but unremarkable chick pea soup, a tender and yummy sea bass, and a very sweet baked alaska for dessert. The consensus at our table of four mirored my own take - Quince is good, and we'd eat here again, but it's but not the kind of place we'd fall in love with. In fact, the best thing we tasted all night was the sliver of candied fruit the house serves after the meal is all done., 'Came here about 7 months after it opened to celebrate surviving my first year of law school. I especially loved the nettle sformato (yep, had to look that up) and the housemade ice creams. One star off for the difficulty of getting a reservation. Must come up with something to celebrate so I can go back. :)', I'd always wondered about this place down the street from my place. I went there a week ago and was very impressed. Tiny restaurant but a great atmosphere. Definitely a great place for an intimate occasion like an anniversary. The service was absolutely incredible, even when my friend knocked her water all over the table and they immediately swooped in with a fresh tablecloth.The food was really excellent (try the artichoke starter if they have it). But I must admit that, for the price, I'd rather go somewhere less expensive and get the same food with slightly less service, or spend the extra $40 a head and go somewhere spectacular (ie Danko or Michael Mina). That said, it's definitely among the best restaurants I've been to in SF.Would get five stars if it weren't so hard to get in and it weren't quite so expensive., 'Update 5/25: Just had another ridiculously amazing dinner, and paired with the most incredible wines. Top-notch all the way. Some highlights: foie gras terrine (melts in your mouth), pigs feet (deboned, wrapped with morels and asparagus, shaped into medallions), agnolotti (their signature delicate little pasta pillows with veal, pork & ?: scrumptious), cornmeal stradette pasta with braised leeks (love the taste & texture), bluefish baked on fig leaf (fig leaf does it!). And a huge handfull of other delectable dishes. I love quince!!! First post: They sometimes have room for small-party walk-ins earlier or later, which is nice to get a dish or two on a whim. All locally-sourced ingredients, half-bottles of wine to pair, and meticulously-prepared everything. (John, it reminds you of Chez Panisse because Tusk used to work there as well as Oliveto.)', '4.5 Stars.. Went with my man for his birthday and it was very romantic and the food superb. The pasta was so good, that it had us wanting to go back to try more.. If you go, you should definitely not miss out on the pasta as it is their specialty.. Maybe get an extra pasta dish instead of a meat course.. And that means a lot coming from a major Carnivore like myself..', I'll start by saying that Quince has got game. And that's not a good thing for me. I don't like game-y meats, nor do I like eating baby animals, so this was not a great option. I probably should have researched the menu a bit more before going... but sadly, I did not. Overall, for the amount of money I spent, I thought the service was on point, but the food was not. First course was okay, nothing really remarkable. The second course of homemade pastas was GREAT! Although, unless you are fluent in Italian, you'll need your server to decipher. There were about 6-7 different types of pastas, and we sampled the Tagliatelle w/squash and that was EXCELLENT. I was not that impressed with the main course - we ordered the grassfed beef and it was very red and raw and not that flavorful for being so raw. And lastly, we went for the fancy McDonald's Apple Pie and were dismally disappointed (warm apple wrapped in puff pastry). We would have done better by going to McD's and getting their pie., It's been six months since I visited Quince, so unfortunately I don't remember exactly what we had, save that all of it was amazing and exquisite (and I'm pretty sure we had an appetizer, and two pastas, and a meat course). The pastas are the main draw here. When I return, I might skip the third course altogether and just pick from the appetizer and pasta courses (the menu is organized by courses). Now I don't think I'm that picky, but I'm not frequently impressed by restaurants, so for me to rave about Quince means quite a lot. I'll just say GO... try it for yourself. Make a reservation in advance, definitely try the pastas (handmade in-house and you can SO tell!), and save room for dessert! I tried panna cotta here for the first time and it was a revelation. It's on the expensive side, but worth it for a splurge every once in a while. It's very romantic, and service was excellent. I'm hoping to return for my birthday, which is coming up in the spring. But I know I can count on Quince to help soothe the sting of getting older..., This restaurant is quaint and romantic... and a definite splurge. The crowd's a bit older and definitely has money. I really liked the decor. It's cozy and feels like a dining room in someone's home. The service was attentive although more formal than is necessary. The food is R-I-C-H! Cheese, butter, and more butter. I was pretty disappointed. The Dungeness crab first plate was great though, while the day boat scallops with chanterelles was swimming in a creamy sauce. My striped bass was good, but not fantastic. You might need a glossary to decipher all the veggies, pastas, and sauces. Unfortunately, Quince didn't live up to my expectations, but it is worth a try., 'An amazing birthday meal sitting next to the ex-Mayor? What isn there to love. Yes, if you want to come here, be prepared. It hard to get a reservation and it a meal that will take hours of time and hundreds of dollars to be done properly. However, if this isn an issue, read on. When I called two weeks ago to make a reservation for my wife birthday, the best they could do for a Saturday night was 10pm - which isn really a problem as wee night owls anyway. When they asked if it was for a special occasion, I mentioned it was my wife birthday, and that was that. This afternoon, the restaurant called to ask if we wanted an earlier seating - which we jumped at. 10pm is fine, but 7:30 is better as we would be able to relax through the meal. The service was amazing. As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by name, coats were taken and we were seated. It was then that we were presented with special menus that simply said Happy Birthday Janet on the top. No big spectacle, just a nice touch showing that they remembered it was a special night. These small touches ran the whole night - our water and wine glasses never ran dry, and the service was transparent - never intrusive or invasive. When the dessert menu was presented, we were asked if we were having a celebratory dessert or just coffee - a small but genuine touch that finished with a single candle in my wife gelato. The food was expertly prepared Alto Adige style cuisine. I started with two sea scallops with pureed sunchokes and black chanterelles, followed by a polpette with German bacon (speck), and finally a trio of pork preparations: belly, house made sausage and loin. Janet had a beet salad followed by a maccheroni with foie gras sauce and a perfect petrale sole. The unexpected highlights were the beverages. From the champagne we started with to a hidden find of a 1994 white Rioja to the Quince ESB - a beer that was more Belgian than bitter - made by one of the chefs. As we left, they presented my wife with one of her menus, rolled and tied with a bow. Walking past Willie Brown who had just been seated next to us, we were happy to have had the experience. A perfect place for a celebratory Italian meal.', 'Ok, so you feel like you just stepped into a print ad for Pottery Barn ~ Apothecary. The interior is rather bland in a tasteful and stately kind of way, and the average dinner guest is, hmmm, I imagine, republican, new-money pretending to be old money, or charm-bracelet looking for an arm to latch onto. But, if what you want is a great eating experience (of the omniovre kind) and youe always searched for an existential place to be alone with your honey(s) (among a sea of unaccustomed otherliness, of the kind Ie mentioned above), this would be it.The food is fantastic. The menu changes, so hard to say what good. An appetizer, of pork medallions wrapped in bacon was indulgent and savory, substantial but not heavy. As a main, I had the Saffron Squash Ravioli in Creme Sauce, and it was next to godliness, nirvana, orgasm or pleasure point of your choice. The flavor was effusively subtle, if that makes any sense - slow uptake, building climax. The rack of lamb my friend had was tender with just enough searing to make that gristle glisten and sparkle in your mouth. Too full, we shared a Chocolate Torte: rich, a little dense and dry but very good.The proportions are a little sheepish by American standards for the price. A place to go for an occasional treat rather than a daily meal. Waitstaff is attentive, formal but not stuffy. Great for conservative parents who you can take to places like Cafe Gratitude (from someone else review).A 4-star experience, if it weren for the general ambiance.DECONSTRUCTION ADDENDUM: Went there again last night. Ah....it the all-beigeness of the restaurant color palate: walls,trim, light fixtures, flowers, accessories (and clientele) that makes it somewhat blah. But the food remains supreme. Don bother without a reservation (at least 2 weeks in advance for prime sittings). Also speak up when seated in the round window corner. It acoustically tricky; the waitstaff have a hard time hearing (all 6 of us). And yes, conservative parents do in fact love it here (no complaints whatsoever).', 'Definitely one of my top three restaurants in the City, if not number one! My co-worker told me once that the pasta at Quince made her want to cry because it was so delicious. I didn cry, but I understand her sentiment. The pasta dishes were light, fresh and flavorful. I had the lobster ravioli; the only pasta that I had that was comparable was at a 3-star restaurant in Paris called Ledoyen. Nothing was over-sauced or over-done. The portions are a very good size, especially since everything is so rich and yummy. Price is not bad either. People were nice... not stuffy. The service was great. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly. My boyfriend must have mentioned to her earlier in the evening that we arrived by cab because as soon as we were ready to leave, they had a cab called for us. Highly recommend for a nice night out.', 'Most definitely one of the best restaurants in the city.The pasta dishes are insanely delicious, and that goes for just about everything else. They follow the formula of Chez Panisse: Super high quality ingredient + superb cooking = extremely satisfied eaters who will come back again and again. The dining room is elegant, but small and too noisy for my taste.', Holy shit this was good. I took clients to dinner here last night. We quite literally sat in the kitchen with the chef as he prepared a ten course meal for us. This is the most coveted table in the restaurant, and right now, one of the most difficult to reserve in the city. We never had to order food - just the chef's tasting menu - and the food just kept coming and coming. Small and perfect portions. Amazing wine pairings (we went through 8 bottles...and there were 8 people). The food was creative, fantasticly flavorful and the service was impecable (we had eight people, and eight servers who surrounded the table and dropped the plates in front of each guest at the exact same time). When you asked where the bathroom was, they didn't point or describe, they took you there. When I retrieved the cigarettes out of my purse and stood to go outside and smoke, the waiter found my jacket in the coat check and brought it to me without me saying a word. It was just a wonderful meal. We were there from 7:30 until 11:30. I enjoyed every minute, every sip, every bite. One of the best dining experiences I have ever had., I agree with the other reviews, this restaurant is amazing. I read about it on a recent list of Best Restaurants in the World in one of the travel magazines - and I believe it! By the looks of their website you would think it to be more European flavor, but I would describe it as more New American - a mixture of both. I don't remember exactly what I ate because this down-home Southern girl needed a little translation with all three courses, but the home made pastas melted in my mouth like buttah! And the staff was very helpful. The bill was over $100 for two, but well worth it., Outstanding. It's hard to get a reservation here but since my parents were treating I wasn't going to complain about eating so early (5:30). Great wine list and great wait staff, the only hitch in the service was having my pronounciation of a pasta dish corrected incorrectly by a server. When I explained that my family was from Italy she looked a little embarrassed. The food is fantastic, especially the pasta. I'm not really a dessert person so I ordered another pasta dish while the others had dessert. The chef was so impressed by that that he comped the second pasta dish. Very highly recommended!, 'Okay, maybe a restaurant should only get five stars if you actually go home with the cute curly hair waiter-in-training whose hands shake a little as he clears off the bread crumbs. Speaking of which, how much butter did they drown the delicious bread muffins in? Open-water rowers have to use lard to pull and release--they could also just rub one of these delectable and oily buns on their buns. Do you think the waiter-in-training rows in the ocean? The appetizers were pretty good. We got some tasty asparagus with parmesan on top and some other appetizer that is forgettable. (I straining to remember but there was so much to watch--the overly inebriated socialte talking to the chubby man with the birthday wife. The socialite veterinarian husband was much more dashing, the birthday wife and he were left out in the cold. Our secondi pastas were remarkable. Eight large ravioli (all the pasta is handmade), each with a different filling: beets, peas, spinach, potato, etc. YUM. And then a cheesy twist-tie pasta that also has some sort of hint of caramel. For the main course, Gus and I split duck, which was very tasty, indeed. Our dessert was tasty but not quite as memorable as the pasta or the duck. We nearly closed them down. I might point out that there was a Ghost Hunt tour going on just outside the street. And if you promise to spend $800, you can eat in the kitchen with your group of six. That a great ambiance, I suspect. And it gives you a big picture window to keep an eye on the ghost hunters.', My friends and I (a trifle underdressed for the occassion) were able to sneak into Quince last night sans reservation. The food (particularly the pasta dish) and the bottle of Rioja we ordered were excellent, the overall atmosphere pleasant (if not a bit stuffy - I left my sports coat and slacks at home!) and the service friendly. With that in mind, If I were to go back, I think I'd prefer eating in the dining area downstairs, located next to the kitchen. The mood (down there) definitely appeared more upbeat ..., 'Great place for a business dinner or when you are willing to plunk down for a special meal. Classy environment. Difficult to get reservations, must be good, right? Ate in the coveted kitchen for a friend birthday, which makes for a more lively dinner than the main dining room. Everyone tried a variety of dishes and everyone shared stuff so was able to get a good taste of the more popular items. The pasta is certainly the standout, but everything was pretty good. Service was excellent, good wine. It isn the best food that Ie had in SF - I think places like Fifth Floor have a slight edge up on them, but they are definitely in that top tier. $8 for valet parking is pretty reasonable by City standards. Total tab was about $2k for 8 people.', I had high expectations of this place knowing where the chef is from. First off, we had reservations for 3 people at 8:30 on Friday night. We didn't get seated until 8:50. Not impressed. If I'm going to be paying at least $100 per person...i expect to wait at the most 5 min. The wait staff was nice. The ambience was warm...a bit on the stuffy side- you're def in pac heights. They was another couple that looked cool but everybody else was or seemed really rich and boring. It was loud in there too. Bring your blazers and cashmere shawls. Now the food...this is an italian restaurant. The menu is traditional- first, second, and third course just like in Italy. The scallops were amazing and the dungeness crab was great too. We had various pasta for secondi. The pasta was top notch...perfect. Fresh and light. I had duck for my 3rd. It was good but not fantastic. I wasn't impressed and I'm a big duck fan. The sea bass was very delish. The rabbit was good too but I didn't see why it was great. I can't remember the dessert. The food is good but Delfina is still my fav italian restaurant. I'm not sure if I come back again. It was a bit pricey. If you want nice pricey restaurants, go to Aqua, A16, Chez Spencer, Boulevard, and Fleur de Lys., We came here for my birthday last year and they wrote happy birthday to me on the menu. They also gave us a great little table in the corner. It's a small, intimate setting, good ambiance, great food, and the service was really friendly, 'unique atmosphere. great food, but come hungry so you can at least go for three or four courses. the pastas were my favorite. dinner for two w/ wine= $170', 'Where, oh where, to begin? We arrived a few minutes before our 8pm reservation, and were asked to wait... in the doorway. The hostess apologized multiple times (to the point where I finally told her to stop) and brought us a wine list. But still, wee standing in the doorway -- there no bar, no waiting area, not even a chair to perch on. We ended up getting seated about 15 minutes after 8, and summarily ignored by our server for another 10 minutes. Adding to all the fun, we were seated millimeters away from a boistrous table of two couples in their late 40s, bragging about their european second homes and the new-college-grad offspring they were intent upon supporting because there no need to torture them with hourly-wage work. (roll eyes) The food was... well, not up to the hype. There were a lot of pristine ingredients, and a lot of pretty plating techniques, but not a whole lot of interesting tastes happening. First courses: The asparagus and deep-fried egg starter was lovely, but nothing that anyone with access to good produce couldn accomplish at home. And frankly, it needed salt. My husband pig-foot salad was more like two mini crabcakes with a garnish of leaves around the band of the plate -- it had nothing of the lip-smacking, porky, gelatinous beauty of the trotter about it, and the sauce was underwhelming. (And no, I don mean subtle.) And, I sorry -- I appreciate the idea of variations on a theme -- but something described as a salad on the menu should have some vegetable matter on the plate other than parsley. Pasta course: My spaghetti amatriciana was my favorite part of the dinner, but it was so sloppily presented -- especially compared to our first courses and other plates I seen go by -- that I couldn help but wonder how it got smacked into the bowl. Served on a lukewarm plate, slightly undercooked and tepid spaghetti was topped with a lovely sauce of tomato, guanciale and red peppers... it made me want nothing more than a real bowl full of it, with a side of bread and a big jug of chianti. My husband papardelle with quail was also too al dente, and oversalted to the point of being practically inedible (and we love salt, trust me). For my main, I had a hard time choosing something that sounded appealing. There were no pork options, and no beef, either. Not wanting to wimp out and order the chicken, and not liking the sound of any of the seafood, I opted for the rack of veal. It arrived pre-sliced (arrrrgh!), slopped onto the plate looking like someone leftovers, and garnished with one raggedy bone from the rack! And, once again, cold plate, lukewarm food. It was also noticably -under- salted, just like my appetizer. (Can someone figure out how to season back there??) The accompanying potato gratinata was closer to the mark, but rather grainy and chalky. My husband sweetbreads were overdone, and nothing to write home about. By the time we got to dessert, there was a pileup of people waiting to be seated, at least a dozen people crammed into the doorway and hovering over the short glass partition in front of our table. Some of them had been waiting for 30-45 minutes by the time they took their seats, and were visibly peeved. Making people wait? OK. Making people wait without a place to sit or stay out of the way? Possible...but borderline. Making people wait for 45 minutes without a place to sit at a high-end place? Unforgivable! Oh, and did I mention that it SO LOUD in there that we literally couldn hear one another across a very small two-top? Not really satisfied by our dinners, we glanced at the dessert menu. I opted for the meyer lemon tartlet with raspberries, and my husband ordered the profiteroles. My dessert looked lovely, but featured an inedibly bitter and burnt crust, amatuerish lemon curd, and disgustigly underripe berries. (I spit out the first bite into my napkin, and nobody ever asked me if anything was amiss.) Mr. C profiteroles came with a layered terrine slice of three gelati -- a delightful cacao-nib flavor and two other forgettable riffs on chocolate. Unfortunately, the profiteroles themselves were no great shakes, and the cherries were so flacid that they weren worth eating. Service was bizarre, starting with the hyper-apologetic hostess, and continuing through the nervous-tic rearranging of glasses and silver by the manager (stop touching my tableware!), and our server spokesmodel-like flourishes when presenting wine bottles for approval. Price for all this was $320 (including tax and tip) for 4 courses, plus 2 stems of prosecco, a half bottle of french Rose and another half of Merry Edwards Pinot Noir. The food was generally tasty, and the level of execution would have been fine -- even remarkable -- at a neighborhood restaurant. But at these prices, food should be uniformly lovely, interestingly prepared, and properly seasoned. We definitely won be going back for another round.', 'hella good. the best pasta that I have had outside of Italy, especially hard to make good stuff like gnocci (or however the hell you spell it). the desserts I have had there are not the best. the little bread thingys they give you before you eat are so good too. I love this restaurant.', Some of the best pasta I've ever had. If you have a decent sized group, do yourself a favor and order several different pasta dishes to share. The chef came from Chez Panisse, and it shows: he keeps things simple, letting the ingredients speak for themselves. The Pappardelle with Liberty Duck and the Garganellis with tomato, pancetta and pecorino stood out, but everything was terrific., Quince-tessential dining!!! Went here for the first time. Cute, intimate dining. Sensational food: blossomed squash, Maine lobster salad, pastas, and lamb three ways. WOW...bursting with flavors!!!!Immaculate service!!! Great wine selection. Definetly a place to treat yourself once in a while. (or you'll go broke), 'my fiancee and i had an excellent birthday dinner here recently. we started by sharing the tuna tartare, which came with some yummy, crispy fried green beans. the gnocchi were perfect, and my lamb three ways was twice excellent and once merely okay (the grilled slices were too well done for my taste, but the rest was superb). the service was adequate, but our waitress was not as helpful as she could have been. when i asked her about the portion sizes of the courses, her answer was, some people eat three courses by themselves, and some people share. uh, thanks. we also had to wait a few minutes past the time of our reservation, which is always awkward in sf restaurants, where there is rarely room to stand. the hostess did bring us a wine list while we waited, which was nice.overall, we had an excellent dinner. my gripes are minor, but when a place is this expensive, i expect perfection. that why ie given quince four stars instead of five.', I love this place. Great for a date if you want to drop some bucks. The pasta is amazing here. It's very close to the way it is in Italy. I haven't been here in about a year so I can't quote the dishes I had. Make sure you make a reservation ahead of time. Great for expense accounts too., A friend invited us for dinner here. This was her favorite here in the city. It's a small and cozy place. My fried tomatoes topped with small shrimp was excellent. My wife of course enjoyed her seared Foie Gras. We splitted the fetticine with porcini mushrooms. Nice light sauce. I had the Red snapped which was very good. My wife enjoyed her lamb but felt it wasn't outstanding. Service was impeccable. One of the best I've expereniced. Only thing missing might be the dark or black napkins (like Seasons at the Four Seasons) for those of us who are wearing dark pants or dresses. Hard to get reservations but worth the try!, Terrible, overrated, stuffy. I've been to nearly every top restaurant in SF, and this by far was one of the most overrated meals I have ever had. Snooty, almost robotic, service. Also, NO COCKTAILS?! A class-A restaurant should have a full bar. Food presenatation was nice, but flavors were lacking. There are many other restarauts in the city that exceed the quality found here. Also, the squab I ordered, though quite delicious, came with its feet and head on the platter. Fine with me but would scare the heck out of any dates., I enjoyed everything about this restaurant except the bill. But even that I took in stride because I've never had such amazing and tender pasta in my life. The entrees were very good, but paled in comparison to the middle pasta dishes. The decor is clean, elegant and satisfying if not inspiring. The service staff was friendly, knowledgeable and had good intuitive skills. I had no problem finding a perfect wine match for the meal on both of my visits (who needs to pay rent anyway?). Quince is one of a few restaurants that should be greeted as an experience or occasion. It's worth a few moments of clearing your head before you go. If you're like me and like a drink for this exercise, you'll want to stop at your favorite lounge before heading over for dinner as they don't appear to serve liquor., Want to eat and get treated like old money? Quince is your spot. It's classy, intimate and tasty. All the qualities of a 5-star restaurant in a Bistro-sized setting. When I visited for the first time with my husband and another couple, everything was top-notch, but the housemade pasta (second course) stole the show. Next time you have cause for celebration, have a little extra dough to spend or -- in our case, have a babysitter for the WHOLE evening -- head to Quince. The attentive, yet-invisible-somehow, waitstaff will assure you're not disappointed., Michael Tusk from Oliveto's in Oakland is a superbly talented chef -- he has all the technical skill needed to operate an upscale restaurant in San Francisco. The food technically well prepared. I was un-awed by this experience. The wine list dull -- overly dependent on Italian wine-- I think his cuisine could easily taken on all French and Spanish wines. The environment is UPTIGHT. I cannot imagine a more sterile decor- white is about the only colour allowed. The service was pleasant but he this is in the Pac Heights world so only the establishment would ever eat here--- and by all means I am not part of 'the establishment' i wouldn't go back., 'If I could give it 10 stars I would. Quince is by far my favorite and in my opinion the best restaurant in San Francisco. Quince has managed to capture a casual state of elegance which transcends not only the food but the visual aesthetic of the room, service, lighting, flower arrangements, etc. From the moment you step into the warm and welcoming room of Quince you feel comfortable but are aware that the experience you are about to part take in will be special. The food is stellar. Plan to eat very thoughtfully prepared homemade pastas. The menu changes daily and always has plenty of delightful choices. The servers are very knowledgeable and not in the least bit snotty. They clearly love food and wine and appreciate where they are. I will go back to Quince again and again.', Ahh finally after a third time at Quince I get around to writing a review. If you are looking for a meal this place fits the profile, but if you are looking for a true dinning experience then this place surpasses all expectations. Sure it's pricey, but worth it. This place runs like a well oiled machine. Everything is done in synchronized fashion it's unbelievable. My first time to Quince about five months ago and I didn't know what to expect. To my surprise, since that time I've had the best lobster salad with cucumber granite, freshly made pasta like gnocchi stuffed with eggplant and mozzarella, seared sea scallops and more... Since the menu changes daily you can eat there multiple times and have difference experiences. If you have a birthday they even print your birthday on the menu and send over a nicely wrapped scroll menu when you go. For anyone who is worried that this place might be pretentious- take it from me they do an amazing job at making the restaurant like a small neighborhood joint. Service is impeccable. I look forward to going back again next month., 'Oh my goodness, how have I not reviewed Quince yet? Once again, not much can be said that hasn been said already in all the previous reviews. However, have I ever passed up a chance to rant & rave? Never! Quince is my idea of the perfect restaurant. And as far as I concerned (next to Chez Panisse) is the best that San Francisco has to offer. First off, the location is perfection. Situated on the corner of Octavia/Bush (in Pac Heights), this is the perfect place for an unassuming little restaurant. Not to mention, it one of the few really great places to eat in this area (which frankly surprises me). The valet parking upon arrival is wonderful (especially when youe running late). And the hostesses have always been nothing but sweet, accommodating and helpful when trying to make reservations (which can be hard to come by on short notice). Secondary to the food, the service is the highlight of my trips to Quince. The waiters are always aware of the dishes, the ingredients, where they get the ingredients from, the wines, food/wine pairing, etc. It really feels that they hand select the waitstaff, which is really the only reason that I will pay the otherwise outrageous prices for their food. Ahhhh, speaking of the food. Impeccable in every way. Presentation is stellar. The ingredients are all fresh (in that everything is organic/sustainable/Alice Waters kind of way). The menu is creative without being too over the top. I always go for the artichoke appetizer and/or salad along with any of their pasta dishes, followed by a fish main course (their halibut is always delicious). Don event get me started on the desserts. I try to save room for them, but end up either taking one home or sharing with my dining buddies. Either way, theye a treat - don leave without one! The restaurant itself is quaint, clean and modern without feeling stuffy. It does get rather loud since the space is so small, but I would still consider this a very nice, romantic place to go for a date, anniversary, birthday, etc. In fact, I would come here for ANY occasion. Yes, this is an expensive restaurant, but I don think you can dock the place stars for being expensive...it worth every penny.', Update 5/05/08, it just gets better and better every month at Quince. Truly an amazing place, with a chef and staff that continue to ask more of themselves in creating a great experience for their customers. GREAT place. Simply the best in the city. The diverse, ever-changing menu, unassuming presence, but excellent service make it a delight to go every time. The Food, though, is the reason to go. Truly amazing. Having eaten at Gary Danko, Masa's, Michael Minna, Myth...this is a BIG step up. In the same vein as french laundry as a wholistic, great place., I've been wanting to dine here for over a year, but I rarely plan anything more than a few days in advance. Finally made a commitement six weeks in advance and that only got me a 6pm Friday table. Luckily, our friends have a bun in the oven, so an early table was fine.I was a huge fan of the Meetinghouse (food & decor), but the minor upgrades to the room make it feel much more open and comfortable.Service was impeccable from start to finish. Actually, some of the most discrete, well-timed, and knowledgable dinner service I've seen in SF in quite awhile specially after a recent nightmare at Fleur de Lys.Food was simply great. Classic flavors, well-seasoned, with reasonable portions. The only clunker was the sformato and that was mainly because the other dishes were so fantastic. It just couldn't compete. Poached veal was exquisite. I could have eatten a bucket full of the rabbit ravioli. I didn't want my pork loin main course to ever end. Each dish left me wanting to go back the next night and eat it again and if I had, I would probably still want to go back again.The wine list was fairly expensive. I rarely drink California wine, so I was looking at French and Italian reds. I did find the 2002 La Chapelle de la Mission Haut-Brion for $70 and it was amazing! The house white (a French Chardonnay) is also remarkable. Didn't catch the name.Overall, dinner for four with two bottles of wine ran a little over $500. If the food, wine, and service had been so absolutely impeccable it would have seemed over-priced, but Quince manages to pull it off. Expensive? Yes. Worth the visit? Definitely., So some of my girlfriends and I work in Food for a pretty well-known company from the Sonoma area. We figured it our duty to dine there (and I do mean Dine -- not Eat) when one of our colleagues, who used to be a chef at Danko, said that it was his absolute favorite restaurant in the city.Strangely enough, the night before we were going for dinner, one of our party happened to be at A16 and met a sommelier who recently started at Quince. This was the icing on the cake, as we knew we would be treated to some amazing wines. We made an early reservation (6:00pm -- Straight from work), and got there only very slightly early. The door was opened for us, our table was ready right away and our chairs were pulled out for us. You don't even notice the wait staff. They sort of breeze by, and appear at the side of your table ready to help you with the menu. We ordered a bottle of white. Amazing. Noise level increased throughout the night, which was a great disguise to our constant laughter and dirty jokes.... Delicious cheese bread balls appeared on table, and didn't stop coming throughout the whole meal, without a word ever being spoken. Being accustomed to tastings, the four of us decided to share everything. We order 4 starters. 3 Pastas. And 1 Main. - Tomato and Bread Soup- Sea Scallops and Shrimp wrapped in Squash Flower- Fried Petrale Sole with Aioli- A Gorgonzola and Egg Tart with Beets and Yellow Haricot VertYumm, Yummy, Yumm.- Nettle gnocchi with Pork Cheek - Little pasta (for lack of the Italian term) filled with creamy cauliflower- Popes Hats filled with rabbit, veal and porkWowsa. Another bottle of wine. Red. Delicious.- Black Sea Bass with PeppersYes! We like it.Then there was dessert....- Chocolate Cinnamon Pot De Creme with Orange Caramel Bon Bons.- Strawberry Tartlett with Purple Basil Ice Cream. Oh yea. Bring it home. Fine dining at it's most pristine, romantic and best. This small dining room is near impossible to get a reservation for, so call in advance. Way in advance. Don't skip a course. They are each amazing. The menu changes daily, and will have you swimming in cream, aged vinegars and amazing cheeses. Our meal took just under 3 hours. So go prepared to lavish in your food's glory for awhile.Not 5 Stars just cause. It's pretty delicious, but it puts a sizable dent in your wallet. Have someone with more money than you take you. And then start with champagne and order 3 bottles of wine. It might have been 5 stars if we were drunker when we left., Quince is an almost-perfect restaurant. Intimate and elegant room, caring servers, sublimely simple, utmostly seasonal food. It is my favorite restaurant in the city, and will be yours if you follow a few guidelines: Don't pass up the starters. They are perfect distillations of the flavors they represent. A tomato will be a perfect tomato. A white bean will be the white bean by which to judge all others. Etc. Order way more pasta than you think you can handle. My date and I once knocked back five courses. This pasta is transcendent. Standouts are the ephemeral ricotta raviolo with brown butter (always on the menu - use the bread to sop up the sauce) and anything filled.  You will be pretty full from all of this crazy delicious pasta. So order one fish entree to split. Fish dishes are consistently excellent. Meat dishes are not. The meat entrees just read better than they taste - I've had overdone, dry, salty. Stick with the fish and you will be wowed. Pass on dessert. Again, they read better than they taste, and are meager. Dessert should be lavish and indulgent! These are not.One more standout thing about Quince is that the menu changes constantly. You can tell that the chef cares about what's best right this minute. There is real love in the food here. Enjoy., After finally dining at Quince last night, I left a little disappointed. While I had no major complaints with the meal, the experience wasn't quite as transcendent as I had expected. The scallop starter with chanterelles was light and a great way to begin the meal. My second course, the bucatini all'amatriciana, was perfectly done and I highly recommend it. For the third course, I had the lamb three ways, which was a little disappointing. None of the flavors really stood out and 2 of the 3 preparations tasted pretty similar. For dessert, I shared a concoction made of chocolate gelati, some kind of cheese (I want to say mascarpone but am not positive) and some other stuff. The wait staff was very attentive and in general the service was great. The room itself is very intimate and seemed to be a good spot for celebrating anniversaries (I counted 3 while I was there) with dim lighting, etc. However, the tables are pretty close together and the chairs aren't very comfortable. I can see why many Yelpers would give the place 5 stars, but I'm pretty stingy with them with regards to higher-end restaurants. I would consider going back for a romantic occasion., Plates and tastes were delicate and charming. The wine recommendation was spot on. We had the early seating so no troubles with waiting around for someone to finish. I really liked all the windows to look out but I would have chosen a different interior decorator. Would've garnered 5 stars if the food were bolder (I like contrasts) and if the prices seemed commensurate with the cost of the plate. (I think they're cashing in on their cool while they can.)|2
42|saison-san-francisco|What a wonderfully unique and amazing experience this evening - 19-July 2009 - on opening night at Saison. The staff was attentive, personable, knowledgeable, and accommodating. Special thanks to Kris, Mark and Josh for making tonight's second-seating such a special occasion.Brut was generously served prior to being seated in the charming main room. After a tasty serving of sourdough bread and European style Straus butter, we were introduced to an impressionable culinary experience with delicious amuse-bouche, containing fine caviar and local ingredients. Next, the heirloom melons with vadouvan spices, bellwether ricotta and wild herbs provided for a robust flavor burst with every bite.Local halibut was served with a shellfish bouillon and enough lobster to impress any skeptic requiring particular adornment in such a dish. The suckling goat was quite interesting - in a good way - and was accompanied by cracked hominy, white corn milk, natural jus and thyme. All seemed to blend nicely in the dish without much need to compete for attention.The evening finished with Lucero Farm strawberries served with crd2me fradcche, followed promptly by mignardises and coffee and tea service.The wine pairing was just perfect. Clearly, our hosts knew exactly which wines to feature with each course.I understand that Saison is booked every Sunday (currently only open one night each week) through the end of August. I will secure another reservation at the next possible availability., You just can't seem to move for new and fabulous restaurants in the Mission these days. This place piqued our interest when we heard it was about to open, so we gave it a try on the opening night.The experience begins before you even show up at the restaurant with a booking process that includes some interesting quirks. It's not on OpenTable, so reservations are requested/confirmed either by phone or through an online booking form. And the menu is fixed - a four course format with wine pairings, and - interestingly - no money is accepted onsite, so everything has to be paid for in advance via PayPal. Once the arrangements are in place one feels less like a restaurant customer and more like a guest at a private event.And the event experience continues when you arrive: the restaurant is located at the end of a driveway that leads from the entrance on Folsom St. At the end of the driveway one of the friendly servers greets you with a handshake and a glass of fizz, and then takes you to your table, via the (brand new) kitchen. All very personal and convivial. From the kitchen you enter the dining room, which is a converted stable and has been created as a small art gallery. Interesting pieces of art adorn the walls of a room which is dominated by a large communal table, with smaller tables dotted alongside the paintings.But on a nice evening - and we were blessed with a nice evening - the stable doors are wide open giving an al fresco feel to the room, and expanding the restaurant to include some tables on the terrace. The restaurant seats about 35 covers in total and it's a lovely space - particularly the terrace with a large orange tree in the middle, framed by enormous and vivid bougainvilleas on the back wall.And then the meal begins. Well keep in mind that this is a joint venture between chef Joshua Skenes and sommelier Mark Bright (both formerly of Michael Mina, amongst other noted establishments), so the attention to the detail of the menu - which changes every night and is based on locally-sourced produce - and the wine pairings dominate the gastronomic experience. A balanced opening-night menu started with an amuse-bouche of lobster carpaccio, and moved on to a wonderful heirloom melon salad with ricotta, sensitively fragranced with trendy seasoning du jour, Vadouvan spices (ie those Franco-Indian spices that hail from Pondicherry in Southern India). Next a delicious piece of local halibut with lobster and a shellfish bouillon, an interesting meat course of suckling goat, with cracked hominy and white corn milk, and a refreshing dessert of strawberries with a muscat sabayon and hibiscus granite rounded out the menu. The balance, ingredients and presentation of all of the dishes was first-class. The opening-night service was still finding its feet, meaning that the wait between courses was a little dragged out, but the prevailing, friendly attitude of the staff, and the generous pouring of wines filled the gaps between courses. And the wines were noteworthy - Mark Bright was pouring the wines himself and had clearly enjoyed complementing the menu with a selection sourced from a base of sustainable producers around the world. Fizz from Alsace, a German Reisling, white Burgundy, a Sonoma Shiraz and a fine Austrian dessert wine accompanied the courses, providing real variety and a nice counterpoint to each of the dishes.One word of warning: it gets chilly on the terrace - two heat lamps get fired up as the sun goes down, but they aren't quite enough to cover the space, so avoid wearing shorts and keep an extra layer to hand. But all in all the pleasant, intimate surroundings, fine food and wine and the attentive service make Saison look like a keeper., Best new restaurant in town! Fresh, local, organic food paired with impressive wine selection.Interesting concept (1x/week with only 1 prix-fixe menu) at a super charming venue (namely a stable with orange tree that will only sits 25 people max)Service: AFood: A+Wine Pairing: ADecor: ADessert: A+Highlights:- Heirloom melons with ricotta and herbs are amazingly addictive. To your surprise, there're a few chunks of water melon underneath the melon. And this is coming from a person who hates melon. - Halibut with crispy skin is soaked in seafood bouillion. A few chunks of lobsters were added to swim around the already-perfect textured halibut and strengthened the flavoring of the bouillon. - Strawberries with muscat sabayon (italian custard) and hibiscus granite is very refreshing and serves as a great ending of the meal- Wine paring $ initially looks pretty steep but the pairings have been extremely well thought of for every item in the meny. Note:Now... one thing that disappoints me a little bit is the goat dish. I know everyone loves the dish and the pairing of the goat + corn milk + arugula salad. However, the menu stated sucking goat - which should have different texture than regular goat. This led me to a slight disappointment that is resolvable by eating more of the muscat sabayon in hibiscus granite,Congratulations to Chef Skenes and Mark Bright., 'I bought into the hype: a restaurant only open Sunday nights with an extremely limited seating. This rarity reminded me of the curiosity and determination I had as a kid in finding secret levels and quests in video games. Tucked away in the far reaches of Mission, I almost missed the entrance had I not written down the address. The kitchen seems larger than the dining room and there were almost more staff (mostly in the kitchen) than patrons... a ratio that hints youe in for a palatial voyage!Amuse-Bouche: My bouche was definitely amused! A single, tiny peeled tomato surrounded by miniature melon balls previewed how fresh the produce to come would be. The basil seeds added a fuzzy texture... good thing they were limited. There were some sort of herbs and flowers that added an anisette flavor to give a kick to the otherwise familiar produce sampling.Sonoma Farm Egg: By far my favorite dish! A single hen egg (Isn that redundant? I mean roosters don lay eggs.) was hollowed out and then filled with layers of goodness. There was caviar, foam froth from asparagus, runny egg and sea urchin. You were supposed to dig to the bottom so you could get all the layers at once, but the tiny spoon hardly caught all the flavors and textures in a single tasting. I enjoyed that though because each spoonful was like a potluck of pleasure.Raw Spot Prawn (surprise course): The concept of a surprise course really excites a foodie like myself. It a chance to experience some quirky experiment from the chef workshop. The raw spot prawn was chopped in 5-6 pieces and bathed in Meyer lemon juice. At first taste, my mouth thinks ceviche. Then comes the smoky pepper powder on top, something that breaks any associations to that fish dish from the non-English speaking portion of the Americas. It a really hard to describe and all I can come up with is raw BBQ, in a good way.Spot Prawn Ravioli: The ravioli was more like a dumpling/mandu/gyoza/momo floating in a light, subtle shellfish broth. The large lobster bits beside their prawn friends were spot on, because who doesn like lobster? This dish was a mingling of well established favorite seafood tastes and textures, proving that sometimes you don need fancy foam to be a tasty course.Marin Suns Chicken: This dish is called chicken, but the star is the chard. Well actually, it not the chard but what inside: foie gras and leg meat! This cigar shaped roll took foie gras to an unexplored realm for me. Normally that tasty fowl liver resides on a subtle brioche causing each bite to melt away in your mouth. The chard and dark meat make the experience chewy which causes you to cherish the fatty foie gras for more bites-per-forkful. The chicken breast was pleasant with a coating of cinnamon almonds (kinda like from a nut vendor). The skin was a little too limp for my taste, but the foie gras chard clouded my mind so I barely noticed.Strawberry & Pistachio Tart: It so rare to find pistachio outside of a phyllo wrapped Middle Eastern dessert. I was pleasantly surprised to find pistachios paired with super fresh strawberries on top of a buttery tart shell. Then add on acacia honey ice cream for a little remembrance of that sappy coating which often engulfs pistachio treats from those desert lands. My biggest disappointment about this dish was that there was no wine pairing... a missed opportunity to show some dessert somilier skills.Mignardises: A fancy term for cookies to go. These flaky, buttery rounds were an amazing evolution on those fatty English biscuits co-workers often bring back when they visit the London office. Spattered throughout were tiny lavender buds, a much more authentic way to get a lavender flavor than simple essence. The large salt crystals made the treat a lot more salty than sweet in some bites, but won points for helping this unique combination: buttery, sweet, salty and perfumey!', 'Overall:We went last night for the 5PM seating and really enjoyed ourselves. To me, Saison echoes the same low-key modern elegance for fine dining as Lstrance (which is now a 3-star Michelin in Paris17th Arrodissement). Refined, yet completely accessible and comfortable. I think the dishes will grow more daring and mature into more than a concept of once/week. And more into a 4-5 day operation with 4 seatings/day (lunch and dinner).First impression:From the moment we stepped off Harrison St. into well manicured landscape entrance, we were transported to a friend courtyard garden party in Europe.Note, the evening was mild, skies were blue, we were wearing layers (I didn wear heels, stuck to my Frye boots -- all the other ladies wore nice heels, since we were going to traipse around in the Mission afterward ).We saw guests had glasses of a Brut Rose (bottles were chilled on a simple makeshift bar with glasses.). Kris soon came out and greeted us and poured us some glasses, like any good host. He didn explain anything and we noticed he was spacing out how he sat folks (every other minute?) in the order in which they arrived. While we waited we saw another couple arrive. They immediately helped themselves to the Rose, while Kris was not there. I thought that was lame -- but I being snotty. Anyway, Kris was NOT snotty and greeted them when he did come back out.Why am I going on about Kris (yes, he adorable, but..)? Because he was an example of top form for service throughout the evening from all the staff we interacted with, including the young man you refilled our waters and created a splash guard of sorts with a napkin as he poured.The ambiance: Loved it. We sat along the wall, opposing the kitchen. So we had a sliced view of the kitchen and a lovely framed view of the outside where there was a citrus tree and bougainvillea? 17 People were inside and I think a few people were outside. Simple decor and artwork. The music drifted in from a Bose speaker with an iPod. We heard some Dylan and toward the end of our meal...M.I.A.! how cool is that!?Food highlights -- very protein rich, but they brought plenty of bread (Acme?):The Amuse Bouche was delightful. It was a play on fruit cocktail (shaved cherry tomato with basil, tiny beads of melon, in some sort of gelatin). Surprise dish! The soft-boiled egg with caviar! this was very French, but light. One of my favorites in outside Saison.The raw spot prawns -- great flavor. I could have used another 1/2 portion. All the ingredient melded together. The Meyer Lemon was lovely!The red sea bream. Loved it! Chef Joshua didn skimp on the sea urchin and the fish was succulent. And Mark was generous with his pourings. One particular wine stuck out for us, it was the White Burgundy that had this finish, which Mark was kind enough to elaborate on -- though I sure he was busy serving up several wines a party of 4 had brought on their own.Favorite wine pairings:The amuse bouche with PARIGOT CREMANT DE BOURGOGNE BRUT ROSE, SAVIGNY LES BEAUNE MVThe Spot PrawnsVIdfA CARTIN ALBARIdfO, RIAS BAIXAS, SPAIN 2007Lemon Thyme Panna CottaERBEN VON BEULWITZ RIESLING SPATLESE KASELER NIESHENALTE REBEN RUWER, GERMANY 2004Again, the graciousness of Mark and Kris to let people enjoy how they want to enjoy was so easy. There wasn any sort of pretense (of course why should there be in SF?) or disingeniuity. The food was creative and fresh with basic ingredients that created complex deliciousness.Ie never spent this much time reviewing things, so I want you to know I wrote this almost more to re-experience last night, than to let others know about this hidden gem in the Mission.', Mark and Kris have nailed it. Send an email, make a paypal reservation and you are on to a dining experience unlike any other. They far exceed expectations at all levels. Get there early and enjoy some champagne (a fine cremant rose when we visited). We helped ourselves but Kris will pour it for you if he's not with guests. You wait outside and are slowly escorted in by Kris - through the kitchen, very classy and very cool. Joshua and his staff will be quietly hard at work as you pass.The dining room is serene, incorporating some very nice art - the tables are spaced out ... you have room --- very nice when you think about being lined up elbow to elbow at some other fine dining restaurants.Every table is paced differently from the start - they sense if you want to move fast or slow. We went slow since we brought a number of aged white burgundies and Mark was extremely helpful in prepping the bottles and stemware and recommending what dishes would work best with each wine. The egg was spectacular, the seabream a delight and the array of flavors in the poularde main course were absolutely insane. The menu will change each weekend but it can be ensured that the lineup will be fresh, crisp, clean and pure. Do the wine pairings as everyone was enjoying them and Mark was very helpful to all who wanted to discuss the wines. But, if bringing your own wine, skew it toward minerally whites and you will not go wrong - think puligny, meursault or alsace. Best bet is put you faith in Mark and he will deliver the goods re wine. This is no place for a huge cabernet until they do shortribs (not likely but might happen this winter?). Last, don't miss out on the carefully wrapped cookies as you depart.Saison is an experience. You can't say that about many places., 'Writing this review is sum what difficult because there are two parts to the overall review. The setting of Saison is nice. With perfect weather outside, we were treated to some bubbly as we waited to be seated. The outdoor waiting area with heat lamps, which were not needed showed a concern on ensure clients were taken care of.Then we were walked through the kitchen to be seated. Interesting concept in theory, but with a personal seating on this event, we were disappointed that it was just a walk through. Kind of expected them to say this is the chef or this is what they were preparing. The room is nice with varying artwork. However, this venue is extremely loud. You could not hear the person seated across the table and it required significantly elevated speech to have any attempt at a conversation. We were then treated with a quick little app of a tomato and watermellon in tomato jelly. Nice, fresh and tasty - perfect for a warm evening. Bread was also brought to the table. We were a little disappointed here as it seems like no effort was taken on the bread. Such a simple thing like bread make a huge difference at a restaurant and yet it is frequently neglected.Next came the egg filled with caviar and covered withsome foam. Very tasty and the Spanish white wine that accompanied the dish was excellent.We were served some Sea Bream sashimi style which was also tasty. We were also treated to a cassoulet of mussels, uni, cauliflower and some other items. There were mixed reactions to this dish. Overall good, but some didnt like either the mussels or the uni. The main dish was squab. A leg, a piece of the breast and then some foie gras stuff inside some spinach I believe. Cooked extremely well and tasty. The Pinot that was served with it was excellent.Desert was also well done and enjoyed by all of us.So, what is the end verdict. I am torn. The wine and the food was good. Many tastes and everything was cooked perfectly. However, this is not an inexpensive meal and you have no choices and you pay in advance. This is really billed in a sense as an experience. Something unique with a buzz as it is only open one night a week. However, the experience just wasnt there. This ended up like a good meal at a normal restaurant. As you dont get a menu, we expected great detail to be given about the meal and the wine. We had to ask to get some extra info. Even then, because of how loud it is, we barely could hear what was being said. The final question, would I go back? Not sure. From a perspective of the food, it get 3 1/2 to 4 stars because there is no dish that left a desire for more, more, more. The wine choices we found to be excellent and we all were adding wines to our memory for future purchases and that gets 5 stars. However, again it wasnt until we engaged the staff that they told us much about the wine at all. The atmosphere was nice, but the fact that with such a small venue that the chef didnt come out to talk about a dish or that the staff barely talked about the dishes or wine left us a tad disappointed. This may be due to the fact that it was too loud for us to hear them, but still that does not allow for the 5 stars everyone else is giving.I find it interesting that all of the other reviews mention Mark and Kris. Of the six of us, I dont think one of us could tell you who they were as I dont recall anyone even giving their name.', We celebrated our 38th anniversary last night at the amazing 5-week old place called Saison. Solid 5 stars++. Sundays only, with two seatings. Cozy casual and welcoming dining room that opens to the huge kitchen. Gifted awesome chef. Impeccable delicious cutting edge foods. Perfectly paired wines. Wonderful and friendly service. Everyone knows when to do what...and what to do when.

We dined on 8/30 and the menu was the same as reviewer aL Z has... except we didn't get any cheeses. I am very impressed with the Amuse-bouche Tomato Gelee, 2nd course Summer Vegetables and 3rd course Roasted Pigeon.Service: 2 starsThey were more than 15 mins late to seat us for our 8:15pm reservation and the outdoor waiting area was undesireable (cold and windy) for a $80 meal (tax and 18% tips included). Also, it was obvious that they didn't have their efficiency nailed yet. I could tell that most of the time only 3 people were actively working even though there seem to be a big crew in the kitchen. We waited more than 25 mins in between our 2nd and 3rd course which again is not acceptable in my mind. Price: 3 starsPricey for what they offered even though food was good overall. I have had better overall experience., I look forward to going back and changing the 3*s to more. All courses were well prepared amazing food leading up to our entree. we had a milk fed pouisson that really didn't leave us with enough food to be considered an entree and unfortunatley left hungry. i guess i shouldn't have starved myself all day leading up to this meal :) the only realy downer was the timing between courses, it was clearly not their best aspect unlike nearly everything else. however they make this up with the attentive beverage service. amazing and very generous wine pairings but up to 40 minutes in between coursesI do think this experience was not the norm and would not use this as the basis of anything other than an off night from coursing from in the kitchen. I would really say that the ambiance, open kitchen, attentive service and thoutghful food are spot on amazing., 'i was here for dinner sunday, and it was good. i want to give it 3.5 stars but do not want to round up to 4.prologue:what is interesting to me was the holding pen outside where we waited for our table. it is a quaint outdoor deck with 2 heaters and a bunch of chairs. (is there a roof for when it rains? i didn notice). what is unfortunate is that is situated past the front door of the restaurant, so if you were like me and confused where to go, and you automatically head for the door since that where you would think you would go, you would be ushered over to the holding pen. i guess it not that big of a deal but the flow was off for me. the staff in the holding pen was very nice, if a tad on the relaxed side. it was lovely that they gave us champagne, but the refill service was spotty, and although i now know that there is a large spider on the back of the holding pen that our server wants to name, again, i think a little more professionalism would be a good thing. i don want stuffy, but perhaps a bit more attentive. or maybe i was just getting hungry since our reservations were for 8 and it was more like 8:30 when we sat, and we got there at 7:45. or maybe i was drunk...act Ihere we are, seated and ready to experience. the servers were very accommodating for me since i am a vegetarian and they made sure to tell me that they knew i was special when we sat down. i liked that they acknowledged me and my food preference. i think they said i was the first vegetarian they accommodated, and they were thinking of doing a vegetarian dinner menu one night a week or something like that. i would probably go back for that. so, the first amuse came out and it was probably the best dish i had all night - early girl toms in some kind of vinegar sauce in a shot glass. it was pretty and yummy. the rest of my meal was plated beautifully and passable. i just not sure it was worth the cost. my risotto was a tad hard still, but maybe that was intentional? the chanterelles in their own bouillon was good, and the dice on the green garnish was perfect, but that all there was. the three others i dined with had fish and squab and abalone. i know there are more things to do for a vegetarian than risotto and mushrooms, but perhaps that is the seasonal aspect of saison. if that is the case, where is the squash? or maybe i should wait to go again in summer...act IIdessert was ice cream with olive oil and coffee. it was great but i don like coffee. there was also lavender shortbread cookies with salt, now they were fantastic. we had tea and closed the meal. epiloguesaison does nice touches like present the food to everyone together. the service was relaxed and efficient. i was a little confused who our server was versus bus boy versus attendee versus maitre dbut i think that is just the new york in me coming out and not the SF side, so il let that slide. i didn even mind that the bathroom was outside because it was large and clean and had loads of hooks. i loved our server who sang instead of talking to me, he was fantastic. i was a total pain in the ass and asked them to write down my menu for me, which they did willingly (although the menu was dated friday and we ate on sunday). i loved how the kitchen was open and you could walk around and ask questions. i wish they would have offered to call us a cab.i guess what it comes down to was that i did not love the price for my meal, and i was even treated by a friend. and i thought we ordered the cheese option but we did not get it. maybe we had to ask for it there? not sure since you pay for everything in advance. but i thought it was paid for.the overall decor was very simple and nice, which lends itself to the atmosphere of rustic luxury (per the site). it was a nice open air environment. like i said at the top i wish i could give it 3.5 stars. it seems that other people who have reviewed saison just love it. i thought it was ok, but i am a vegetarian. sigh, i can wait for the day come when i don have to caveat that.', This is one of the coolest, tastiest, most awesome restaurants I've ever been to. It's not just a meal but an entire experience. It's fine dining without the pretentiousness and snobbery. Several things beside the food and wine selection that were wonderful:1. They do a small seating for each meal, so it's very intimate (max 20 ppl i think)2. The kitchen is completely open and you are free to ask how things are made and go up and actually see for yourself- you can even meet Joshua the exec chef3. Mark Bright the sommolier/wine dude pours you wine himself and answers all the stupid questions you have with a smile- the wine just keeps on coming4. Before you get seated, there's a cute outside patio area with an orange tree and limitless champagne from spain5. The did a great job catering to my lactose intolerance and let me bring a candle for dessert (it was a birthday surprise)6. Joshua decided to do an impromptu extra dish- HOORAY!7. We were so stuffed at the end we couldn't eat the lavender cookies and they let us doggie bag them home with even some extra ones thrown in there- AWESOMEEEE8. Dinner was 4 hours- this could be a con for some, but I LOVE long dinners Some things that were not as great before I get onto the food:1. Hard to find, and on reservation confirmation they didn't have the address2. Only one bathroom that apparently doesn't lock easily enough for some people, because I walked into an old man peeingOnto the food and drink (I will try to remember):Before seating: champagne from spainFresh baked breadGerman Reisling 2007Amuse bouche: beet on paneer cheese with walnut Slow cooked egg: with foam and caviarMore bread- with olives this timeChardonnay from Burgundy 2007 Flight of fish: 8-9 different sea-things/fishBonus plate: pan seared halibut with fresh greensPasta plate: fresh reginette in uni sauceCabernet Rhone Valley 2007Main : pork on some sort of grain with apples- the pork was to die for with delicious tenderness and crispy-ass skinDessert: yuzu tart with chantilly cream + coffee + lavender butter cookies with seasaltMy description does not do the food and drink justice. Everything was impeccable and amazingly delicious. :), We would go back for sure, even though the food was not 100%, it was probably 90% on the food score. My Poussin was not cooked, I can eat rare chicken but not raw. The lavender cookies were good but there was way too much salt on them. When i rubbed off the salt, they were awesome. All the other reviews will tell you about the detail, exquisite attention that went into the food which made that stand out. We also got an extra course which was unexpected. The food was good for 5 of the 7 courses, and for that I am docking the stars. Wine pairings were fantastic, and the generosity of the wine moved the review from a 3.5 to a 4 for my rating. The service was pleasant. The whole thing was suppose to be intimate, but the servers spoke so low I couldn't hear them explain half the menu. It was still delish though. With wine, dinner, tip, taxes etc it was $140 per person. Not cheap, but we were there for over 3 hrs and not at all rushed. Enjoyed the experience. We tried to make a reservation when they first opened but the whole reservation method was annoying, as they were so pretentious at the start. Now that they are opened more nights of the week, its not as hard to get a reservation. Would recommend to friends who like food and don't mind the price., 'When given the opportunity to attend a 7-course gourmet French dinner with wine pairings at half of the normal dinner cost (normal being $150), I have to be an idiot not to say yes. While it didn blow my socks off or make my heart stop because I finally found food nirvana, it was a fun, quite time-consuming and surprisingly tipsy experience. We arrived about 10 minutes early and our group of 12 or so mingled in the courtyard outside under space heaters and the champagne flowed freely. By 7:20 our entire party was there and we were seated for the sole seating of the evening (7pm) and all were buzzing from the endless bubbly pre-game. Amuse-bouche - a grapefruit ginger concoction in a shot glass. Some sipped, some pounded it back (guess which one I did) and it was a light refreshing start to the meal.Our Farm Egg - This was a favorite: smoke butter buillon, lightly boiled/poached egg and Osetra caviar in a gorgeous round glass.Autumn Vegetables - Another winner. Perfectly cooked root veggies in a savory jus. Red Sea Bream - I wasn crazy about this dish. It not fun picking bones out of your mouth during a meal and the flavors fell short.Marin Suns Pig - Their take on pork belly was alright, though far from the top pork belly Ie had. It was actually almost bland...Bellweather Ricotta Tartlet - They served coffee before this course came out and we were actually worried we weren going to get a dessert. The ricotta was light but I would have actually preferred something a bit richer after such a light meal (believe me, after 3.5 hours those piddly servings weren getting the job done). Lavender shortbread cookies - these were basically salt wafers. Look, I enjoy salty sweet foods but these were inedible...someone should have tasted them before allowing it out of the kitchen. Service - Incredible attention to detail. They laid the napkins on our laps, served the women first, and even provided a free car service home. The delay between courses became painful at times and we were drinking wine to stave off hunger - which only resulted in lots of drunk conversation and watch checking. The wines were all wonderful, though I would have appreciated a little explanation of what they were and why they complemented each dish. We asked the sommelier for more details and even just the name of the wines (one of them I wanted to look up later on) and he kept blurting out the name quickly and walking off importantly. I think perhaps the kitchen was a bit flustered trying to get all the dishes out simultaneously and orchestrating a meal in unison. Although there were missteps along the way, it was a fun night and we left dog-tired from too much yummy wine and hours of conversation. If youe a foodie and appreciate locally sustainable meats and veggies - and enjoy french cuisine - then I recommend going with some like-minded friends for a really long catch-up. But don go here on a first date if you don want to be stuck in small-talk hell from 7-11pm.', 'Delightfully Decadent & Unbelievably Unpretentious...Saison is a Mission Gem!I was blown away by Mission district dining experience...anyplace that welcomes you with a glass of French bubbly in courtyard & ushers you into hip zen dining space through the kitchen encouraging eager foodies to check out food prep during meal is the best, in my book!Nosy by nature (but I prefer the term curious), carte blanche kitchen access to chat with chefs, ooh & ahh over dishes & take pics was awesome!Saison has a chef table but I felt like I was in the thick of it by sitting in dining area & making MANY trips to kitchen!This unique spot is amazing & menu is locally & globally inspired.7 courses of local organic French/Nuevo cuisine were thoughtfully prepared & beautifully presented with unobtrusive food notes & lovely glass of vino to heighten the flavor & experience.Menu: Changes weekly but can not imagine it can get much better!Amuse Bouche of sorbet over longpepper jellySanta Cruz Dirtygirl Beet with Cowgirl ricottaSlow cooked egg with doshin cream & osteria caviarSweetwater oyster with Matsutake mushrooms & seaweed in bouillonFancy Fish Fllight: Thai snapper, mackerel, local scallop, Tamales Bay O Toro, blue bandit sprout, live prawn (My favorite!)Sea urchin with papperdelle and chiliSlow roasted Sonoma lamb with Vadavoun spicesCitrus soup with olive oil & tangerine sorbetShortbread cookies with lavender and chunks of sea salt (addictive!)', 'Happy to make this my first review at Yelp!I have been wanting to do this for ever now, but finally got to do it!!Had dinner with another couple on Friday at Saison and it was absolutely amazing. Really enjoyed the attention to detail and the creativity from the set up to the meal. Really recommend it, we felt like we were in NY.They had white truffle as a supplement and it was sooooo worth it!!!Good luck Saison!', Simply terrible! The only good thing about our four and half hour meal, aside from the company, was the endless supply of bread and the large, albeit necessary, wine pours. After drinking champagne for an hour and a half we finally got our first non-starch, a raw slice of clam with seaweed and radish (inedible), then came some type of foam egg which was followed by our first actual course, over two hours into the meal; a mushroom aspic. I'm still torn as to what was worse, the clam or the aspic, perhaps because I could only suffer through one bite of each. The remaining courses weren't as horrible, but they were all equally small and only slightly less bizarre. To add insult to injury the bill came out to $200 per person, plus another $10 for pizza afterwards. Avoid!, Saison's 5 steps for a 5-star review.1. Make the location hard to find, no sign, just a woman costumed as wait staff beckoning you from the sidewalk.2. Do not provide a menu, just whisper a seemingly random list of ingredients that sound like they have to eclipse anything Thomas Keller or Alice Waters dreamed of.3. Keep the glasses full of sparkling wine, even if the customer says they have had enough.4. Do not serve any food for at least 90 minutes after your guests are seated, assuring that they will be so inebriated (see 3.) they will not realize the food is simply inedible.5. Include foam in every single dish.Saison disappoints. The pretentiousness did nothing to hide the fact that nearly all the food was just plain awful. (What was that gelatinous terrine?) Service of the several course meal took nearly 5 hours. Only salvation for me was the company at my table. Don't be fooled., this place is unusual & cool, but there are problems:-portions are quite small. i'm not a big fat eater, i understand this isn't buffet family place, but i had to eat something when i got home.-lots of FOAM, very late 90's. -bread didn't blow me away. (and @ the price they charge for the experience it should)--i get the whole secret in the know restaurant thing, but to really fulfill the promise of NO SIGNAGE, pricey food, go thru the kitchen experience, the people should be warm and friendly. they were not. i hung out a bit in the kitchen during LONGdowntime in b/w courses and got perfunctory answers - no they weren't so busy, about 60% full. the woman who lead us into the kitchen from the sidewalk was all business. (good thing she was there too - i'm serious - NO SIGNAGE).when you pay over $600 for 4 people (@ a place that seats 30?), is it unreasonable to expect the chef to come out & say hi?-aside from my foam criticism, i didn't eat anything incredible. yes, the soft boiled egg w/ caviar was tasty, but only in the way warm fat and salt are together. the chicken gelee (jello to you) was way too chickeny, the agnoletti had more chicken juice all over. i'm NOT a fan of veal so i gave my portion to the husband - who liked it, esp how rare it was (gag). the lavender salt shortbread cookies were VERY YUMMY, the red walnut crispy thing w/ salt caramel ice cream dessert very tasty - EXCEPT that the texture was not crispy enough - it kind of fell apart when touched - i would view it a failure had it come out of my kitchen, but the taste was good. when food portions are kid size (@ pre crash prices) it must be unassailable. not the case here.PROS:-beautiful design. they have the details down eg: small triangle cut from corner of yellowed page of french novel placed under warm egg cup., vintage ye olde typewriter font on menu., cluster of river worn rocks in bathroom sink (BUT the bathroom garbage was overflowing), warm ochre gravel in courtyard in front of kitchen. ok, not the BEST art, but someone is paying attention.- i can't really speak to the wine, i'm not so knowledgeable, but my friends were pleased w/ the pairings. and they were generous w/ the pours.-and no rush. w/ the long wait in b/w courses, how could they? we sat @ 7.15, got out @ 11.30. and when food hit the table everyone ate - no dallying over bites, we were starving.-i don't think there's another place like this in SF.also, service was at a level to be expected for this price. yes, they folded napkins when you were away, fresh wine glasses, that sort of thing. but this is de rigueur for this price.i wouldn't go again, but would recommend w/ these caveats., 'I really enjoyed Saison...it seems like I went to a different restaurant than another reviewer!Stable Cafe is the HUGE sign outside. Just walk back through the courtyard. They seated us even though we were about 10 minutes early for our reservation.We got a menu (each) that they left on the table next to us throughout the meal. When each dish came out, they explained it to us. The food was very yummy! Especially the egg. I didn really taste the caviar, but I definitely tasted the bacon at the bottom. My glass was literally never empty--they are generous with the wine pours and it easy to lose track of how much youe had. The service was a little slapdash--two different people came by and asked us if we wanted sparkling water, and they said they would come by and talk to us about the supplement, and never did. Though there were seven courses, they were all sized down. I didn feel over-stuffed when I left. A unique and delicious experience, and I can wait til Spring to go back again.', For a local food $$$$$ restaurant, I was very disappointed by their wine pairing not that just with the pairing with the food, but the transition from one wine to the next was very unrefined. Also, They were serving wine from France --- Not sure how that is local.The food was unique but not amazing... I've had better at other local restaurants that are 1/5 the cost..., I really enjoyed my dinner at Saison. The ambiance is great, and I thought the staff was appropriately attentive. The wine pairings were poured very generously, and while I would have liked a little more information about the wine, they were all delicious. My only complaint was with the fish dish. While the Ootoro was amazing, one of the fish bites in the middle was way too gamey for my tastes. I am pretty adventurous in terms of food, but after chewing for 5 minutes, I gave up. The chef said they were going to expand their hours soon, so more people can come and check them out. Overall, I like the concept of what they're trying to do at Saison. I would love to go back and see if my second experience was as good as the first., 'Was looking forward to trying out this restaurant for weeks - fine dining in the Mission ! The whole design/concept is charming. It is located behind the Stable cafe which is a hip renovated stable. You are initially greeted in a warm inviting courtyard with a glass of champagne. Seemed as if we were in for an enchanting evening. We walked through the cold kitchen (nothing like a Per Se kitchen tour) to our table. Our table was very large which was awkward for two people, but we felt fortunate they were able to have us that evening so we made due. Never receiving a menu, we had no idea what we were in for. The first dish was a delicious red beet with some dirty girl cheese. This was yummy but things quickly went down hill again. The dinner bread was placed and it was something I could pick up at the grocery store. It must have been about 20 minutes before anyone talked to us again. No one asked if we wanted any wine. We gave up on thinking this is the quirkiness of the restaurant and realizing this place actually might be bad. The awkward truffle shavings (did not work well with the dish), cold lamb, uninspired dessert, and soapy cookies were further disappointments.This is a great concept. However for the price ($$$$ for 2 ppl)...the food, service, and atmosphere did not cut it. Some improvements can be made: heating inside, clean restrooms, attentive/consistent service. Since courses are on the smaller side, need to condense time...we were soo hungry! I hate to post a negative review especially for a restaurant I really wanted to believe in. I wouldn recommend but it was an xperience..', My experience with Saison would have to be classified as fine-dining in farm form. The preparation, ingredients and presentation of the food is what you would get in an upscale, traditional restaurant but the ambiance, dress and entire feel is very laid-back, casual and very San Franciscan-Mission-District-like. You enter through what seems like the back entrance of the restaurant where you immediately step into the kitchen and then to your seat. The room is darkly lit, the walls decorated with pretty modern pieces of art. I recall some type of 3-d insect attached to the wall--very strange! but not in a bad way! The food was very good but I want to say I've had better and the pricing is a bit steep. However, some memorable dishes with the farm egg, smoked butter and osetra caviar. There was a bit of foam on top that blended all the flavors perfectly. The terrine of cepes mushrooms with gelee as well as the abalone dish were pretty amazing as well. What impressed me was the selection of champagne and wines served and for that cheers to Saison!, 'Saison is one of the most unique food experiences in the San Francisco culinary scene. Lets get one thing out of the way: its super expensive. Its almost French Laundry expensive, but not quite. However, the experience from beginning to end was unique enough that I feel like I got my money worth and will definitely go back. I loved having a dining experience where all the choices are taken out of your hands. The menu is set. The wine parings are done. I love this, but I am the kind of eater who will go to a sushi bar and just tell the Chef to bring me whatever they want until I tell them to stop. If you are a person who is very particular, tends towards substitutions or orders dressings on the side, the experience will be lost on you. The best thing about the restaurant is that the wine just keeps on flowing so the conversation at your table never stops. I am a big drinker, so this was a real key selling point for me. They poured a Chassagne Montrachet and Oregon Pinot that were delicious. As for the food, I don have the menu, so my descriptions are rough. Of the seven or eight courses that we had, I would say that four were excellent. The amouse bouche, a warm oyster in the shell in a broth, was tasty though not as bright and light as one would expect from a classic amouse. It felt more like an appetizer. This egg dish was amazing and very subtle with wonderful layers. I wanted a second one .. The poulade was fabulous, so moist, with skin so delicate and crispy that I would have loved the skin all alone. The desert was fantastic. The beet with bone marrow was fine, though I really didn get the connection between the two components. i thought the Giant Clam lacked flavor and was under seasoned ... a bit more salt and maybe some lemon for acid would have brought that up. I was running late and the staff was just as nice as could be about it. The service was nothing short of wonderful. A++++ all around. They made you feel like you were eating in their living room.', 'an amazing experience. Took my wife there for her birthday. On top of food being unbelievably fresh and clearly prepared with immense care, the service was perfect -- accommodating and friendly. The wine pairing is a must.', 'I had a surprise birthday dinner here with some friends and had an amazing experience. When we first approached the restaurant, I was like Stable Cafe? Ie never heard of it but if it good, I there! When I found out it was Saison I was really excited! The ambience was casual and relaxed.We were greeted immediately and seated in the restaurant. Our reservations were at 5:00pm and were the first to be seated and served Chd2teau de Luld9e Crd9mant de Loire sparkling wine. Our sommelier, Mark, proceeded to serve us great wine pairings.Our tasting menu with wine pairing for the night was:sweetwater oyster, hojiblanca olive oil, meyer lemonfarm egg, smoked butter, osetra caviarcauliflower, vadouvan, yali pear & citroncarmelized shoots, leaves & flowers, roots stewed with bonitolittle beets slow-roasted with hibiscus & bone marrowpoulard, whole roasted with podi spices, foie gras, almond milk, natural juschocolat-walnut tartlet, salted caramel ice creamEvery dish was well thought out and balanced. I don normally like beets but Saison won me over....and that saying a lot.I don know much about wine and can comment on it but the Pinot was really delicious. Restaurant was rustic and bathroom was clean AND warm - they were so nice to put a heater in there to keep us from freezing!I really enjoyed my dinner here - the food was exquisite, service impeccable and most importantly, company was fabulous! Thank you dahling!', 'First off, Saison location guarantees street parking. Oh, sure, maybe your car will be broken into during dinner, but that possibility keeps the excitement level up. As soon as we stepped into the kitchen (enroute to the dining room), R noticed the table set for four about 5 feet away from the cooking prep area. It looks like fun; you are right in the middle of the action! I checked it out and agreed, yes, fun, but probably also cold, since it just a few feet from the front door. Turns out I should have lunged for the kitchen table. We sat inches away from some crazy artwork that was just a bunch of nails sticking out of a frame. Very distracting. My mother would have had Feng Shui conniptions.But then the food came. Hurray for the sonoma egg soft poached in its shell with trout roe and foamy butter. The only way this dish could have been improved is if it came with a second, backup egg. Mmmmm. Sooo good.Daikon and other tasty little roots in bonito broth was a great reminder that fat is good, but don forget about umami. I ran out of daikon and speared one from R bowl. He let me. That love. Meanwhile, the wine pairings came around like a wedding reception. No lyrical waxing over terroir, just a name and the pour. They weren very thoughtful or revelatory pairings (sorry, no OMG! I didn know whites from the Alto Adige paired well with deep fried fun-size Snickers!), but the wine never stood in the way of the food. The only miss all night (aside from sitting next to Hellraiser front door) was a bone marrow dish that accidently got some beet in it. Oh wait, it supposed to be in there? No, pls don mess up my bone marrow with all this random beet puree. Haven you made your point with the beet cubes?A few of the reviews mentioned that this place is expensive. It is. But there a very nice bonus if you can hold your booze. The lovely folks here will just come ound and keep refilling your glass with whatever is being poured during that course. Yay. Don worry, I can still remember how we got home.', Bf took me here for my birthday. Came here with high expectation since it is considered expensive from my regular dinning. I like how this is a fine dinning restaurant but at the same time you can wear casual clothes, because I don't like to dress up! Before going into the seating, bf had sparkling wine, and I had a non-alcoholic drink. Just because I need to save my alcohol tolerance for the wine pairing. I completely forgot their menu, but I found this on their facebook page (of course became a fan!)amuse-bouche - AWESOME!flight of fish - super FRESH! various fish prepared raw, flavors from japanmonterey bay abalonea plat, coastal lettuces & their saucespaine farm squabbeetroot, huckleberries, hibiscus & roasting juicescitrus soup (We can go reverse on the course and have this as the starter =P)tangerine ice cream, olive oil infused with coffeemignardisesI HEART THE dessert: definitely would go back just for that! BTW - the chef is HOT... hopefully bf is not reading this!, 'Saison is possibly the best restaurant in San Francisco right now. We went last weekend and had the set menu and wine pairing. The decor is modern, but casual and funky. The wine pours are generous and thoughtful. Service was perfect. If you love Cyrus, you will love Saison.', The best thing going for Saison is the ambiance -- it's laid-back and interesting all at once. I applaud the concept of being able to go to a nice meal without having to get dressed up. Unfortunately, the food, although good, is not at all worth the price. We had the tasting menu and wine pairing for two; it totaled about $350 (with tax and gratuity). For that sort of money, you would expect an amazing meal. Unfortunately, you won't find it at Saison. Likewise, the wine pairing are fine, but neither the wines themselves nor the way in which they were paired blew us away. One of the other reviewers suggests that Saison is similar to Cyrus. Not at all. Cyrus is in a league all its own. Saison is well back in the pack.Other points worth mentioning:1. Service: My fiance and I have a few dietary restrictions. Nothing all that unusual, particularly for the Bay Area. I don't eat meat or fowl. He doesn't eat shellfish or pork. We noted these restrictions in our reservation, which we made about 6 weeks before the dinner, and confirmed them the day of the dinner. Then, when we sat down, the first thing we were given was a chicken liver dish. When I noted that I didn't eat fowl, they took away both dishes, and never came back with any replacement. Then they served bread -- with lard (i.e. pork). The next course was an oyster dish. Their solution for my fiance was simply to serve the exact same dish, but without the oyster. Sort of misses the point. The rest of the dinner went on very much the same. Given the amount of advance notice they had (and, not to beat a dead horse, how much the meal cost), they really should have been able to do better.2. Bill: As mentioned, the food is not worth the price. But even worse, they charged us for sparkling water and a cup of coffee. Given how expensive the place is, I would have thought they could have thrown in the cup of coffee. That's the sort of thing normally included in a prix fixe meal. And, then, get this: they charge tax on the gratuity! When we asked one of the waiters about this, he explained that because the gratuity is guaranteed (at 18%), it is appropriate to charge tax on the gratuity. I don't know if that's legit or not, but it seemed bogus to me., 'Definitely not worth it. Just got back from a dinner at Saison. Yes, it has a nice ambience ... so if you like to pay close to French Laundry prices for average food and wine in a nice ambience, this is the place for you!Food was not great, not even average for fine dining, I would say. Tiny portions of pretty good stuff followed by a big portion of average chicken (something you could get at Costco for $5). The wine was below par as well, nothing which really wow-ed me. And the wine service was pretty slow - clearly trying to slow us down. Desert was delicious though ... The only thing which wow-ed me was the bill - $176 per person - for that? Are you kidding me? Definitely not worth it. Go to Goood Frikin Chicken, then to Tartine for desert and you have a better experience without forking over a pile of dough! Or, if you have the cash, try any of the fine dining places in San Francisco - but this is by far the worst in terms of bang for the buck. Stay away!', It was difficult to write this review because the food itself is very high-minded, the presentation impeccable, and the goal of shining a spotlight on a single flavor is clearly achieved. However, while the menu was certainly refined, and the technique involved in creating the intricate dishes is advanced, the subtle flavors of each dish could've been enhanced with a bit more balance and seasoning. A more detailed account of my night can be found in my Examiner article, which you can read by following the Examiner link in my profile.At the end of the day, Skene's vision of paying homage to the garden and our local markets is clear, and if you like subtle, uncomplicated food, this should absolutely be a restaurant on your list., 'Noise level: 2/5 bells (5=loudest)Ambiance: See belowYou will not find this restaurant if youe looking for a Saison sign. It is tucked behind Stables Cafe, in the middle of funky Mission neighborhood. The idea of maybe finding a gem in these living on the edge streets makes the search for it all the more exciting. As you go through the kitchen where there are 10-12 white uniformed men and gals cooking and doing the plating, you feel like youe going the wrong way. There are probably no more than 6 bare dark wooden tables with a communal rectangular table for 8 in the middle of the room, complete with wooden benches. Simple wildflowers in small glass vases adorned each tables. Right away, you get a sense for the kind of ambiance that theye trying to achieve: rustic, simple and down to earth, pottery barn meets, well, what do you know, stable/barn! Except I didn quite get the nail studded frame on the wall and a giant metal insect on the other side of the wall. Flickering light from small tea candles create a nice, intimate atmosphere. Now, about the food: simple, delicate flavors and very fresh ingredients clearly set this restaurant apart from others. I loved everything from the sweetwater oysters and wild California caviar to the fresh vitello tonnato to the very moist whole roasted poularde, again delicate flavors, no big and bold flavors to shock your senses but done very nicely. You can taste the talent and creativity with each dish. The wine pairing was well matched to the food and the pours were very generous.  Seatings are limited ( total of 5 seatings a week) as theye only open 3 nights- with 1 seating on Sundays. I would definitely go back.', 'There definitely no other fine dining experience like the one I found at Saison! Skenes (Exec Chef) and Bright (Wine Dir) have successfully managed to translate the soul of what seasonal farm fresh is all about. Saison thoughtful menu coupled with careful wine selections melded beautifully together where the flavors of each natural ingredient were evidently showcased. This was probably the cleanest (in terms of not too oily) and most well-balanced meal that Ie ever had. The wine pairings are super generous so pace yourself because you don want to be caught on dish #5 and still working with glass #3. Here was the menu during our experience:1. little leeks, sweetwater oyster jus, wild california caviar - Yea, this dish just about made me a fan of caviar FOR GOOD.2. farm EGG, smoked butter & golden trout roe - Scoop all the way to the bottom and pull up to get all the layers! Those little layers have many tasty and textural surprises!3. Not sure of the name but it was a roots and veggie dish with a presentation that was really impressive. It was put together by sous chefs arranging each ingredient with tweezers and the result was worthy of a landscape architect vision.4. Not sure of the name of the raw seafood dish but it was by far my favorite. It was basically the best ingredients you would want to eat from the sea.5. caramelized shoots, leaves & flowers, roots stewed with bonito6. little BEETS aigre-doux & bone marrow - Hands down the best bone marrow that Ie ever had! I hope this stays on the menu for as long as possible so that others can experience how divine this was.7. A serving of poultry dark meat, white Meat, and foie gras that were really juicy and tender.8. Cow Milk Cheese and Honey Walnuts - Generous portion of fine cheese with walnuts to complement9. SATSUMA ice cream, mandarin granite - It was described to us as Saison creamsicle but I think it way better than a creamsicle! The mandarin granite added a lovely tartness to the finish10. chocolat-walnut crumble, salted caramel ice cream - The surprise is the foundation to this dessert...a heavenly layer of ganache!I am definitely looking forward to my next visit to Saison!', Absolutely fantastic experience! One of the best fine dining experiences I've ever had (and as a former consultant, I've eaten at quite a few high-end places).Setting: Located behind Stable Cafe, with a cute small dining room. I was fortunate enough to book the chef's table, which was literally located in the back of the kitchen with a fantastic view of all of the action.Food: Fantastic! Great variety of local, fresh preparations. Here's what we ate (copied from the menu):l i t t l e l e e k s , w i l d c a v i a r , m e y e r l e m o no u r f a r m E G G , s m o k e d b u t t e r & g o l d e n t r o u t r o eR O O T S s t e w e d w i t h b o n i t o , c a r a m e l i z e d s h o o t s , l e a v e s & f l o w e r ss a n d d a b s a r t i c h o k e c i t r o n n e , v a d o u v a n s p i c e sc r i m s o n B E E T a i g r e - d o u x , h i b i s c u s & b o n e m a r r o ws o n o m a l a m b , w h o l e - r o a s t e d w i t h w a r m s p i c e s , n a t u r a l j u sp o i n t r e y e s i n v e r n e s s s u n - t o a s t e d w a l n u t sS A T S U M A i c e c r e a m m a n d a r i n g r a n i t ec h o c o l a t - w a l n u t c r u m b l e , s a l t e d c a r a m e l i c e c r e a mThey also included a few lavender sea salt shortbread cookies at the end when bringing out the bill.Also, a pet peeve I often have with fine dining institutions is that you leave hungry - was not a problem here at all. Left sated and quite full.Service: Very personal and attentive.Value: No cheap at $90 for food + $60 for wine, but definitely worthwhile., 'Interesting concept with pretty tasty food. I love that you walk through the kitchen and are greeted by the entire staff on your way in. Small, intimate dining room, with great service. The food was divine, my favorite being the slow cooked egg. Detail and thought were put into every dish, which was greatly appreciated. I will definitely try this place out again and look forward to what they decide to offer on the menu.', Great dinning experience, and here is why. Reservation are only at 6pm or 8pm. Food: solid. Set menu for each night $80, wine paring $50. Priced well for what you get. As aways, fresh local ingredients, everything surrounds the main ingredient, and the drinks are bottomless. You finish what you drinking, they will come around and keep pouring till you get to the next dish. Service, excellent. You get the types of service as you will at Gary Danko. They fold my napkins everything I stepped away. Decor, casual. This place is at the back of Stable cafe. You walked through the garden, and enter to the side of the building, and walk through the kitchen where the actions are before entering the dinner room. The lighting are soft and mostly natural. A big communal table in the center surround by maybe 8 smaller tables. Overall, it is a nice long 2 hour dinning experience that didn't feel too uptight, and you will walk out a very happy person., I've eaten here a few times and each time it's been slightly different. The concept is excellent and most meals I would have given them 4-5 stars. I may even amend my review after my next visit, however, a few things need to be mentioned about the most recent menu iteration. Specifically: 1. Sand Dabs and Vadouvan Spices - Fish felt a bit fried and the spices a little off. Fish may have been too light to stand up to the preparation and the spices. The artichoke was also a bit sour to be combined with the spices and fish. 2. Beets and Bone Marrow - Flavors good, for me the temp and spacing of the items on the plate were off. It could have been an individual fail vs. a fail of the dish concept. 3. Lamb - Again, the spices and the meat were not working for me at all. The serving of the lamb was too large for my liking to come at the end of the meal. Some were complaining about the fattiness of the meat (fat to meat ratio was about 50:50). I think this would have been fine if the serving was smaller. Again, I love this place and it's worthy to go back for sure. And I'm pretty confident they'll continue to work on these dishes that are failing., Quite simply the fanciest dinner I have ever had the privilege of enjoying. Amazing.I have the added dimension of working the farmer's market that the Chef's from Saison frequent, so I too know the farmers that grow the food., 'I rarely give five stars, but the tremendous quality of the food and lovely wine pairings deserve it. Simply spectacular . Kudos to Mark and Chris!', For all its hype, I must say I was sorely disappointed by this restaurant. It sells itself as a foodie destination with innovative techniques and amazing food. Uh, did I go to the right place?Truth be told, I was excited to try it out the food of Josh Skenes and thought the idea of same-time seating with the same menu was interesting. The dining room was nice, felt very homey and private.But the food was pretty average and not memorable at all (except for the tiny portions). Normally that would garner 3 stars. But the bill came and it was $180pp! I knew it would be pricey ... but that much?! It was double what I had expected. Did they charge for bread and water and coffee?For that much, I could have hit just about any top-end restaurant in the Bay Area (w/o wine pairings, which is fine b/c the wines were just so-so. It doesn't matter that it was all you can drink).For such an expensive meal, I expect to be blown away (and have been at The French Laundry, Cyrus, Gary Danko, La Folie). I'll just chalk this up to a lesson learned. An expensive one at that., Not the kind of place I can afford very often, but I'm so glad I did (and I'm saving up to go back). Three desserts, fantastic wine pairings, a lot of flavors that blew me away, and all seasonal, all farmers market fresh... Amazing that food this orgasmic is legal in public! After a week of consideration my favorite things were the first dessert (sun toasted walnuts with meyer lemon honey and a wedge of cheese) and the careful choreography of the wait staff (I saw them line up in the kitchen and walk out in a chorus)., 'I give it 5 stars but for one dish I spit it out: so it was a 5-star experience (food, service, decor, everything) minus one terrible dish.Wonderful atmosphere: feels like youe in an upscale garage. It is easy to miss the space because it very hidden. But that what makes it great! No neon, no big signs. Just simplicity.The service was great and it was just a great dining experience--small restaurant with 2 seatings on the weekends with about 8 tables (there is one table in the kitchen that looked really cool if you can get it!). You walk through the kitchen to get into the restaurant!The champagne and wine flows quite freely so don drive ;-)Food related, the great dishes were fantastic. I had to take a star off because I didn get the lamb dish and instead got some rotten tasting roasted vegetables. If I knew that they were gonna give me nastiness I would have just gotten the lamb because at least it tasted good, and I don even like lamb. It a shame that they couldn do the vegetables well so BE WARNED: IF YOU SUBSTITUTE, YOU MAY GET SOMETHING TERRIBLE. It was a little surprising because I have substituted in other nice restaurants and gotten great dishes.Ok for the good part:farm egg: absolutely wonderful; be sure to dig all the way down and get a full bite.asparagus salad with shaved asparagus: DELICIOUS. eat it all. We substituted the sea urchin for lobster and it was perfect. lobster substitute: instead of the scallop I got a lobster substitute: they cook lobster like no one business. SPECTACULAR.beet: I don even like beets but this dish and the cooking was wonderfullamb: I didn order this but I tasted it because I spit out my roasted vegetables. Cool spices but it just lamb. chocolate walnut crumble with ice cream: to die for.Great restaurant. Would be back, but I will be careful if I have to substitute. We got lucky and got a reservation on opentable. And we had to add a person and they were very accommodating. So great service and friendly too!', Will write an in depth review later, but WOW. We had an amazing experience from start to finish. Loved it all (not crazy about the scallop, a lil raw for my taste), but the rest of the food was to-die-for. The wine was paired perfectly and was FREE FLOWING! Loved that! All the wines were young and the one wine I looked up was a $17 bottle, but it/they were all paired just right.. and we were poured as much as we'd like. I hope I get to go back, an amazing experience: food, wine, service and ambiance!! :)facebook.com/#!/album.ph43_, 'service is poor, my date got sick after eating trout roe in a egg shell', Saison is not your all-out-fine-dining/luxury restaurant; it's more like fine dining - deconstructed. 2/3rds of its space is devoted to the kitchen - which you have to enter and pass through in order to get to the actual dining section. And the dining section is minimalistic - sparse white linen, candles, a few wall hangings. Clearly it's about the food - where the food is made, where the food gets plated, and that plate being the center of interest when it's brought to your table. And wow - what an interesting series of plates to come out. Over nine courses and almost 3hrs: wild CAVIAR en geleeour farm EGG smoked butter, golden trout roeASPARAGUS roasted with bonitosea SCALLOP steamed in seaweed, green peas & sea urchin sauce crimson BEET aigre-doux, hibiscus & bone marrow (veal)sonoma LAMB whole-roasted with vadouvan spices, roasting juicespoint reyes inverness (goat cheese), sun-toasted walnutsoriol SATSUMA ice cream, mandarin granitechocolate-walnut crumble, salted caramel ice creamDid I love everything? I dunno how anyone can love everything that comes from a pre-determined menu, that's just not the point. The point is, each and every course is intriguing. Now - I'm that girl that eats big, and eats rich - heavy, fatty meats - I'm on it. (Do NOT pervert, that, you-know-who-you-are). But surprisingly the course I liked the most was the asparagus, that night. 1st of the season asparagus spears, perfectly steamed & shredded, bright, yummy salty bonito flakes, and they didn't mention the bed of grain - I think it was bulger that must've been cooked in amazingly seasoned stock - the whole plate burst with flavor. The sea scallops w/seaweed that followed was strangely bland, in comparison. I'd never tasted vadouvan spices either (sounds like the next big thing - maybe it'll finally snuff out the overuse of truffle oil) - I'm going to have to try making a blend at home, now. That was, of course, my second favorite dish - I would've liked the spice blend to been a bit more heavy; if you dare to spice lamb- kick it up, I say.All in all, a wonderful meal - which is good, because you're definitely paying for it. The waitstaff while not totally on the ball, were friendly/accessible without being overly intrusive or stuffy/distant. If you can, ask for a table directly in view of the kitchen - watching the quiet dance of cooking and precision plating will be almost as entertaining as the results., Food was outstanding. Wine pairings were thoughtful. Space was intimate. And the staff was professional, friendly, and attentive. What more can you ask for? Honestly, one of the best fine dining experiences of my life. It'd be a shame to pass this up for some of the more traditional, factory-style places in the city where they don't give a damn who you are or why you're there. They work for your business at Saison and that for me is what separates it from all the rest., 'Everything about the meal was amazing: the food was creative and delicious; presentation was beautiful; the wine pairings complemented all the flavours perfectly. All of that combined with the attentive and friendly staff as well as the cozy atmosphere really made dinner memorable for all of us. Definitely one of the best restaurants I had the pleasure to eat at.', 'On a gorgeous evening with unusually mild temperatures and a strangely good feeling in the air, a certain gentleman picked me up, looking quite dashing, for a highly anticipated first date that was, as is his usual style, scheduled weeks in advance. To call it a first date was rather unusual given that I seen him more than most people in the last few months, and had already shared many great meals with Mr. K, as we shall call him for the purpose of this review. He had arranged the entire evening, and he picked the restaurant. I loved the entire planning process that had gone into it, but I will admit that I was a tad nervous because I had discovered, and he had admitted, that he does not fit the mold of a true foodie. I, on the other hand, feel physical pain when I have to act like I love the food when I really don. The predicament I might end up in had me anxious for the entire day.Originally, he had picked Seasons at the Four Seasons Hotel, but he knew I already been there and he switched last minute to Saison. The first oddity was that I had never been here; the second oddity was that I had never even heard of this restaurant. The third oddity was that there were only 47 reviews on Yelp for Saison at that time.The last and most notable oddity is that my non-foodie date happened to pick one of the finest dining establishments to ever exist in San Francisco, proving that research, intelligence, talent, and effort can match the tastebuds of any true foodie.Saison is a fascinating concept to fine dining. It not stuffy; in fact, it rather casual inside the restaurant but it has a distinct but understated romantic aura. There is only one seating on Friday evenings (7pm), and from the moment they spotted us outside to our eventual exit, service was impeccable. As Mr. K had requested, we were seated in a private corner. There something very European about being in this space, and I not sure what it is as Ie never had anything similar while dining in Europe. What immediately set Saison apart from the likes of other similar dining establishments like Fleur de Lys or even Gary Danko was the active (and welcomed) involvement of the sommelier, Mark Bright. Not only does he explain what he is pouring and why - and not only is he spot on with each amazing pairing, he will keep your glass full throughout the evening with whatever he thinks you will enjoy and is pleasant, to boot. Mr. Bright puts on the fabulous finishing touches to the amazing experience that the chef initiates from the kitchen.Early on in the night, Mr. K asks Mr. Bright if the chef has anything special for the evening. He consulted the chef and within two minutes, the 9-course meal would become an 11-course meal for us, with the fabulous addition of lobster and foie gras to the already enticing menu.Now to the food.Starting with the amuse bouche of a caviar concoction, I was wowed. The farm egg w/ butter and trout roe was as close to perfection as something should get. The asparagus w/ bonito and grains managed to pack flavor and sang to my tastebuds. One of the additional courses of lobster sashimi graced our table with its own Viognier pairing then, followed by the other additional course of a large piece of perfectly cooked foie gras wrapped in cherry leaf, lightly drizzled with a sauce that was HEAVEN ON A PLATE. The lobster and sea urchin course that followed was simply divine. The roasted beet and bone marrow course was the ideal mixture of heavy and light on one plate. All I can say about the Sonoma Lamb course was that never have I see lamb come so close to being as rich and delicious as pork belly. NEVER. This was followed by the cheese course, a fun little rhubarb float soda, and a strawberry almond tarte creme fraiche ice cream. Creme fraiche is divine on its own; make it an ice cream and how can it possibly be anything but sinful?Saison is by no means economical. To eat at Saison is a flat $90; pairing your dinner with wine (and I highly recommend this part) is $60. When the chef throws in the additional courses - the price creeps up to what would be a dinner costing nearly $500 including tip for two people.But it for two exuberantly fed, merrily intoxicated, and blissfully enraptured people beaming from ear to ear in what is perhaps one of the most romantic settings. Not every dining experience ends this way.I looked forward to a fun-filled evening with someone I knew I enjoyed spending time with but what I ended up with was so much more than that. It was the last day of a ridiculously tumultuous month for me, and I was honored to end that month in the company of a wonderful man who treated me to a euphoric meal and proceeded to make this one of the best evenings in history as we headed elsewhere.Thank you, Mr. K. - I had an amazing time and so appreciated the planning, effort, and thought you put into the entire evening. It was truly... delightful.', Solid five star experience!Fancy pants food without the attitude. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant. I wish we could eat here every night! Husband and I came here with a friend when the restaurant had just opened. I love the open kitchen concept. It makes dinner a complete experience, rather than just getting plates served from a mystery kitchen.Josh and his team were great about guests roaming around and photographing them at work. The meal was fantastic--super fresh ingredients, including a sashimi plate with fish flown in from Japan. It felt like an Alice Water-esque meal with much more culinary flair.The wine: I am not a wine drinker. In fact, I don't really like wine at all. But we got a complimentary glass of Syrah with our lamb dish. It was the best wine-food match I've ever tasted... the lamb was absolutely meant to be paired with that wine. WOW. I've never experienced anything like it.I could go on and on about this restaurant, but in the end I would just be saying, GO HERE if you want AMAZING food cooked and served by down-to-earth chefs.(Or don't, so that we can snag another reservation.), 'Amazing concept, but falls short of its promise. Stable cafe by day and fine dining by night? This place has amazing potential but did not deliver. We felt like secret agants as we were looking for this restaurant. Hard to find, but we were waved in by a woman standing outside a gate. Walking in through the kitchen to the restaurant was a nice treat, one which kicked up our excitement for the meal. That is about as good as it got. Food was very under seasoned and not very different. It was the type of meal that with every bite you eat, you think to yourself, I could have made this better. We left hungry as well because the 4 course portions were so small. I do not recommend this place until they can elevate the cooking, flavors and technique up to the level of their concept.', 'Stuck between meh and A-OK. All of the wines on the list were fantastic, and I not a wine fan. It fell short on the food, and atmosphere. Everything was delicious, but I expected each dish to be mind-blowing, but not one came close. What do I mean by mind-blowing: serve me something I don like in a way that makes me love it, or take something I know very well and elevate it to a level where I think, Why haven I always eaten it like this? Given the price point, my overall impression was that it didn deliver; the concept and execution were both unrefined. And then the french pressed coffee was tepid, which still irritates me.', 'Sensationally Good (perfectly prepared)Adventure in Dining (where else do you enter through the kitchen?)In A Spree Of Sinful Tastes (two caviar courses!)Offered with Nonstop Wine Pours (take a taxi)No Other Place Is Like It (well worth the $200/person tab)', This is a very difficult place to review. It had so many of the pieces of dining at its finest, but I just can't get over the fact that the food was such a disappointment in taste.The good:-great space, love that you can see both into the courtyard and the kitchen from your table (though you no longer enter through the kitchen, don't be disappointed) -impeccable service-wine was delicious, unique, and perfectly paired. The sommelier was friendly and took a great deal of time with each table, he also gave us a wonderful tawny port on the house after we requested an after dinner drink-dished were artfully arrangedThe meh:-the food just did not blow me away, I found the flavors and textures one dimensional, and either too bland or too overpowering. i found two of the dishes actually inedible; barely cooked sliced cauliflower with a few grains at the bottom, and the extremely heavy sweatbreads coated in overpowering spices reminiscent of garam masala. -desserts were uninspired. if you are going to serve me a few strawberries with graham crackers as a course in an 8 course meal, they need to be damn good strawberries -really, no amuse bouche or surprise courses? Those are one of the best parts of a tasting menu!-the chef propretier was actually there the entire night, standing at the front of the kitchen. When there are only a few tables in the entire establishment, why would you not come out at least once to ask people how their meal is? -the music was a loud, so it was very difficult to hear the servers explaining what your dish wasI really hope they refine the food, because this place could be phenomenol. Until then I think your money can buy much better meals elsewhere in the city., 4.5 STARS!If I would've reviewed this before Frances, this would be a five star review. But I thought the food at both was superb, just think paying more than twice as much for equally excellent food bumps it down. I will ABSOLUTELY be back. The service was impeccable, food delicious, the wine pairing was too generous (had a little hangover the next day). All in, I really enjoyed the experience. If money is not an issue, then this is an unqualified 5 stars., I'm feeling irritated more than anything after my experience at Saison tonight. Irritated that after a $98pp meal (excluding drinks, tip etc), I was still hungry enough that I had to stop for a super taco on the way home to feel as though I had some food in my belly. Granted, I don't have the appetite of a waif, but neither have I recently lost mine and found a donkey's.In addition to not feeling full, I was also irritated that such a hefty figure had been spent on food that was incredibly underwhelming. Everything was executed wonderfully, so I really can't find fault with the way things were cooked, but the flavours were sorely lacking. I felt as though there was much more emphasis on using fancy ingredients for the sake of using them, rather than for what they added to the meal. Take for instane the Brassica dish that had a quai's egg yolk cradled in a tiny cabbage leaf - very pretty, but it really added nothing. Plus the veggies were just a little too al-dente and the froth on top of all the green just reminded me of cuckoo spit. Roasting sweetbreads in wild grass embers is nothing but pretentious bollocks if the flavours underwhelm.Dessert was equally disappointing...the rhubarb sorbet was superb, but the vanilla/milk granite (sic) melted away before I could get from bowl to mouth. The pickled rhubarb slices were also unwieldy. The strawberry, yoghurt ice cream and 'shortbread' was another let-down...strawberries had little taste, for starters.I could go on, but I won't. I'm going to go and enjoy some homemade strawberry ice cream to bury my feelings of having been ripped off and because the more I write, the more irritated I again get., 'Saison has a few things going for it: intimate atmosphere, great service, and one hotty-pitotty chef. The hostess sat me in full view of the guy - I love dinner theatre.Since I had an early client meeting the next morning, I opted out of the wine pairing. The first course was little vegetables in gelee, douglas fir. I into truth in advertising and they weren kidding when they said little. I think the diced veges could have fit into one tablespoon. It was obvious by the perfect little cubes that the knife skills of these chefs is top notch. However, the gelee was odd for me since it lacked any discernible flavor. The mackarel cru was very fresh and tasty. I especially enjoyed the deep fried mackeral fin on top that gave the dish a nice contrast. The bassicas was every part of the every kind of cauliflower sauteed together. The star my my meal was the abalone - a roasted baby abalone that was so tender and sweet that I could have eaten five of them. I definitely want the recipe!Next came the crimson beet and bone marrow - I was expecting a lovely huge bone that I could dig out the unctuous marrow. No, I got A baby beet and a cube of marrow on a huge plate. The proportions were comical. It took all of the self control I could muster not to laugh. I understand whimsical but I almost thought I was being punked. After we devoured it in two bites, my friend asked if I wanted to go get a baby at El Farolito. I normally can get enough of sweetbreads but their rosted preparation left the glands too dense. It would have been better if they roasted it in smaller bites to get a more interesting texture otherwise sweetbreads can get boring. I wasn a fan of the rhubarb sorbet plate cleanser but I not a fan of rhubarb. The fresh strawberries and yogurt ice cream was a refreshing way to finish our meal. Saison has a lot of talent (and I don just mean the cute chef) but I feel that it is a victim of it own hipsterness. To be honest for a comparable dining experience, I would go to Coi.', We went to Saison for an anniversary dinner. It was everything a special-occasion restaurant should be. We had 8 exquisite courses, each one just a few bites -- the perfect amount of food. Everything was beautiful, well prepared, and delicious. The service was impeccable -- not fussy, always responsive. Although they seem to have a wine list, they mostly push the wine pairing: a different glass with each course. We had brought a special bottle of red wine, but since the first several courses were fish or vegetables we ordered 1/2 a wine pairing each. Our bill came to $350 -- not something I'd do often, but worth it. (It could have been another $70 if we'd done the full wine pairings.) Only complaints: When you're paying this much for a prix fixe meal you shouldn't be dinged $8 for a cup of coffee. The last 2 (dessert) courses came at a much slower pace than the first 6. Intentional? And our bill included 2 full wine pairings plus corkage for the wine we'd brought. But the waiter quickly fixed the error and waived the corkage. I'd definitely go back -- but not often (at those prices). They're supposed to start ala carte service soon (maybe they have already)., 'This place was a total home run for my husband and I. We went for our fifth wedding anniversary and the minute we entered the low-lit romantic courtyard with someone to greet you and the wonderful smell of a wood fire burning I knew we had hit on something new and special. We were given the choice of outdoor seating by the wood fire oven or inside which seemed equally elegant and romantic so we went for a semi circle oothtable. Besides the the booth seats, I noticed that each chair comes with a blanket/pashmina should it get chilly as the restaurant has a sort of indoor/outdoor set-up. The decor is total rustic luxury (reminding me of Manka Inverness Lodge) with a view onto the kitchen a la Alice Waters... We were immediately brought two glasses of champagne as a welcome. We did the tasting menu without the wine pairing, just by the glass. Each dish was inventive and absolutely exquisite, sheer culinary art in your mouth. We were completely blown away over and over and over... Cant say i had ever eaten weet breadsand when the waiter announced this was the gland of some sort of animal, i thought, OK maybe theye taken it too far but low and behold, it was so extremely delicious and savory that i was an immediate convert. I have such a hard time understanding those people who walk away from this meal hungry. What?! A tasting menu is MEANT to be eaten slowly and each dish will of course be a small portion because if you put each course out on the table at once it would add up to A LOT of food, certainly more than enough calories to suffice the average over-fed American like my husband, and a bit too much food for a smaller French appetite like mine (I could only eat one of the sweet breads). This was an outstanding culinary, dining experience at the top level. Really fabulous for a romantic meal. We met the chef at the end of the meal, because you are invited to check out the kitchen if you like, and he asked us if we had had enough to eat (most likely based on some of these reviews), and we said YES, more than enough! and also told him this was one of the best meals we had in San Francisco all year.'|3
43|schwa-chicago|The first time I went to Schwa was in June 2006, and I really liked it. For some reason - probably the long waiting period for a reservation - Mike and I had never been together. When Schwa reopened this winter, I called and got a reservation for his birthday, and we could not have asked for a better meal. For the winter menu that's currently being served, Michael recommends guner veltliner, pinot blanc, and pinot noir wines, so we brought a GruVe and a pinot noir, and they both complemented our meal perfectly. Supposedly nine courses, but we actually got more like thirteen.Amuse: honey sorbet with hints of chamomile, grapefruit, and shaved black truffle: the perfect palate cleanser.Jonah crab with banana, celery, and coriander microgreens: delicious pickled crab with banana chips, fried bananas, and a little salad of the microgreens and celelry.Beer cheese soup: Made with chimay beer and cheese, served with a mustard crisp and a hot soft pretzel ball. I could eat this every day.Jellyfish pad thai: some of the best pad thai flavors I've ever had. The jellyfish handled the spice and nuttiness of the sauces exceptionally well.Pinecone: The famous pinecone with juniper jelly and sea urchin ice cream. Mike loved this, but I was not a huge fan of the uni ice cream. The junipier jelly was pretty delicious though.Quail egg ravioli: One of these was definitely not enough. Parmesan cheese, quail egg, and perfectly cooked pasta. I was tempted to lick the bottom of the bowl...but I refrained.Arctic char roe with pumpernickel and rutabaga: very salty, not my favorite, but the rutabaga consomme and rutabaga balls were very tasty.Kona kampachi: served lightly seared with maple foam, lime pudding, and pickled daikon. Flavors that I would never have put together, but I dish I wish I could have had more of.Liver and onions: I was not looking forward to this, but I was pleasantly surprised. Onion risotto, topped with well-cooked, well-seasoned, and generally very tasty calf's liver. I probably wouldn't order it, but if it got put in front of me, I'd definitely eat it :).Antelope: one of my favorite courses of the night! Antelope was served two ways - sous vie with butternut squash and a soy or tamarind based sauce, and then a stewed antelope with white chocolate mousse. Absolutely delicious.Dessert: An interesting course. Parsnip custard, garnished with candied veal sweetbreads, lavender foam, and passionfruit coulis. I didn't eat the sweetbreads, but the rest of it was surprisingly good, sweet, and definitely satisfied my dessert craving.Birthday Bites: Lie and say it's someone's birthday, even if it's not. This is pureed cake batter, frozen into little balls, dipped in white chocolate. Fantastically good. Service was amazing. The kitchen staff signed Mike's menu for him to keep and they could not have been nicer. No corkage fee, and we weren't charged for coffee either. We're going to try to make reservations now for the spring menu, whenever it comes out..., This isn't really a review, since I haven't actually eaten at Schwa...more of a warning to not enter unless you have a reservation. My boyfriend and I tried calling 3 times, and no one answered the phone. So we stopped by to see if we could get a table. When I walked in everyone looked at me like I was a crazy freak, and finally a chef came out to inform me that they are reservation only, but that they do not answer the phone during serving hours. He checked to see if we could get a table, but they did not have enough food to accomodate us. I suppose we will try again another time, at least they were realatively friendly in declining me service., Schwa doesn't need my rave because every foodie in the city (and in the country) who eats there will tell you that this is one of the most amazing restaurants in the Chicago area. It is Alinea/Trotters caliber with a much, much cheaper prize tag (nine-course tasting for $95 is not necessarily cheap, but you should see what you're getting) and it's BYOB, which obviously saves a fortune. The cuisine is creative but delicious and surprisingly filling for such small plates (as I said, it is NINE small plates, which is pretty significant). The service is wonderful. The chefs themselves actually seat and serve you and describe in detail what they have prepared for you. Despite the potential for pretension, it's a totally laid back place. At the end of the night on a quieter night lately, the main chef sat down at a table with some old friends and share a six pack of beer with them. I can't imagine you'd see Charlie Trotter do such a thing!Yes, the reservations are impossible, but weeknights are easier and they did have some cancellations the night that we were there in November. I'm already gearing up for the next reservation there in a few months. It's worth the wait!, Wow. The food, in a word, sublime. As you may know from other reviews this is a small place, seating around 26 people. The service was unpretentious and informative. Reservations are difficult to come by due to the size of the operation. Our party all had the nine course option priced at $100pp. The flavor combination was brilliant. The fact the restaurant is BYO saved us the equivalent of Costa Rica's GNP. If you enjoy Contemporary American cuisine and consider yourself even a little adventurous (in a culinary sense) Schwa is a must-visit., 'Call me a simple girl but after waiting 2 months to get into this place- I was eagerly awaiting an experience that has been described as one of the best food experiences in the city. Well, I say- save your money. Maybe it was an off night- the chefs did come to the table to tell us that they were having exhaust hood problems (in fact- they first told us that they were not going to be able to serve us) but they didn tell anyone else that at the other tables- hmmm- maybe a hint of things to come?I like eclectic food, presented in an artsy way- this night it seemed like the art was taking precedence over the food as while everything looked great- 9 courses at $100 a person- we were all disappointed with the food. We knew it would be a little out there (how about beet juice in a shot glass served with a beet rolled in chocolate powder or ravioli with quails eggs, or caviar that had a caramelized topping to break through?) but usually it comes together better. My fav courses were the melon and prosciutto plate/soup, rabbit that came deboned and was delicious as well as a beef plate that had a small short rib on it (didn care for the raw beef and quails egg and pickled beef that came on the same plate)and the spoonful of risotto. I kept hoping to get one of the selections that other people wrote about on here, but no luck.There are no waiters- the chefs do all the cooking and serving and explain each course and they put down the plate. Our chef seemed to be irritated with us that we chose to stay after he said they were having problems. I know he was stressed but it would have been better to hide that from us. We brought plenty of wines to serve with the courses and had some problems with the chef remembering to bring the right wine with the right course. Also- there are no wine glasses- youl be drinking your fav wine in a water tumbler- somehow also didn work for me.If you are going to go- keep a watch out- it nondescript black awning doesn make it pop on its block of Ashland- I actually drove by it twice and then thought maybe it had closed. I followed another couple into the door- only to find that they had not make reservations two months prior and they were sent away.We left disappointed as we had such high expectations. Again- call me a simple girl but a simple girl who won be back!', I know I know--the word is that the food is fabulous and worth the price especially since you can bring your own wine etc. And the chef has great talent with a smashing ravioli like none other and chestnut soup but some frankly-wierd combinations that don't play with old foodies like us.But the worst thing is the arrogance--the music is loud and crashing and unsuited to enjoying the food. But the waitstaff don't give a hoot--the chef likes the music--but so what if the customers don't. And what kind of stupidity is it to charge $5 fee for BYO and not provide appropriate wine glasses--don't they know that wine should be served in decent glasses to get the full flavor? One more thing. Lining up (#2 in the line) for the rst room, which necessitated standing aside the kitchen,which promised to be a worthy wait--we were shuttled back to our tables with a promise that we would be called when the restroom was vacant. Have they called you? They never called me.I will NEVER return to this restaurant. The food is excellent but there are far better places for food and none of them are as expensive or as arrogant and un-customer-oriented...try another place for good food. One Sixty Blue, A Tavola, Copper Blue, Tizi Mellou--don't go there and be treated like unwelcome family members., Just had dinner at Schwa last night. Price is up to $105 for 9 courses now. Food is comtemporary American done very well. If you're a self proclaimed foodie, wondering how Chefs rejunvenate old pairings or come up with new food compositions. Then this is your restaurant. Store front looks like a hole in the wall. But when you step in, it's an understated, elegant room. Service is minimal but adequate. And I appreciate discussing each course with my server. The kitchen staff bring you your food, expains all the ingredients to you and takes care of giving you new forks and knives after each course. I personally don't care about stemware. They do give you a new glass each time you pop a new bottle. Outstanding courses: Chestnut soup, quail egg ravioli, the rabbit, tumeric ice cream. Some courses came out on plates like paintings on canvas. A few misses too: the risotto as cheese course, the beet juice at the beginning. Nothing special.I went to Alinea before everybody got googoo gaagaa over it. I believe Michael Carlson's Schwa will become the same phenomenon., Schwa is a treat for the adventurous palate. The experience was certainly more palatable for me since someone else paid for my meal. While you might not love every dish, you will appreicate chef Michael Carlson's audacity. FYI, he was one of Food & Wine's top chefs of 2006. You can choose between a $55 or $105 menu, which buys you a 3-course or 9-course meal, respectively. Don't worry about going hungry if you order the smaller menu; they bring you extra items in between the listed courses to keep you satisfied. The night started with a chocolate-covered truffle with a unique bacon powder and a beet juice concoction as a chaser. Next up was the sunchoke soup, a heavily (IMO too) creamy soup with the consistency of bisque and interesting citrus accents including candied kumquat and blood orange. The quail egg with ricotta, brown butter, and parmigiano reggiano was divine; the initial saltiness is quenched with the most delicious cheesy, creamy mixture you've ever tasted. The main course choices that night included delicous sturgeon (I stole a piece from my friend) or the equally delightful pork with black truffle, parsnip, prosciutto, some sort of mushroom, and other tasty garnishes. The candied apple with hint of sea salt and I think some sort of peanut powder was very yummy. My dessert of pretzels with a a paste of caramel and dates and unique turmeric ice cream was pretty good. I was jealous of my fellow dining companions who had the chocolate brownie with pumpkin ice cream. There is no wine list. However, there is a negligible $5 corking fee for BYOB. I recommend bringing along a red, a white, and a Riesling to complement your various dishes. The resturant is small and the decor is minimalist. It is easy to walk right by the restaurant as there is little to clue you into the location from the outside. Reservations are imperative; good luck getting one., This was the most amazing dining experience I have ever had.Friends of mine were original diners when it opened and being crazy foodies raved and raved. They finally (and it is true it takes forever to secure a reservation) got a hold of someone for a reservation and made it for 4.The whole thing with it being difficult to get a reservation..well, it's part of the fun if you ask me. I heard from an inside source that after all the recent publicity they are looking into having someone do phones on more regular basis..so don't worry.As I mentioned there seems to be so much written in the last month about this restaurant so no need to get into details on the food..but I will say that this restaurant opened a whole new world of food to me...it was spectacular.Two of us do not eat any meat aside from seafood and the chefs were seemingly excited about this and provided us with amazing variations on the meat dishes our dining friends had. Yes there was rap music playing pretty loud but I found it to be hilarious and fun, the place is small, so you feel like you are dining in a living room and though we didn't speak to any other diners, you felt a sort of communal energy. It's pricey but well worth it! I could go on, but so many have covered it better.I hope this restaurant starts a trend of amazingly creative, mind blowing food in small intimate restaurants in Chicago.It was more than just eating food and more like experiencing art., 'Here some history on the Schwa:If Alinea didn open in 2005, Schwa probably would have been the city best new restaurant. Michael Carlson was named one of Food & Wine Best New Chefs that year. Then they received 3 stars from the Trib. Finally, Chicago Magazine named Chef Carlson Best New Chef of 2005. Well deserved for a fantastic restaurant.The good side of schwa (and it is a REALLY good side) is that chef Carlson is operating an incredible BYOB that turns out dishes that are on par with Avenues, Blackbird, etc. Both starters we had (quail egg ravioli and lobster ) were good, as were the two entrees (pork tenderloin and scallops). The pork and lobster were my favorites and I was thinking about the meal even days later.The dark side of schwa is that because of all the accolades, everyone wants a piece of it. Additionally, because chef Carlson refuses to expand the restraunt capacity beyond whatever he and his two/three assistance can accomodate themselves, there just isn enough room for everyone who wants to go here. Ie seen some other reviews where people have had trouble getting reservations and gave it one star based on that alone. That seems somewhat irresponsible to me. It like deciding you want to go to a restaurant in Minneapolis and then complaining that the drive was too long. It a SMALL restaurant that EVERYONE wants to go to. Of COURSE its going to be hard to get a reservation and OF COURSE they are not going to be spending loads of time fielding questions and answering phones. They run a small operation (which I completely respect) so you need to call during the hours they answer the phone and expect a 2+ month waiting list for weekends.If you are willing to look past the fact that its not a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant and put up with the extra effort required, I think you will find that it well worth the wait once you get there.', 'I just went there last night and had a fantastic time! The food is delicious and was worth the month-long wait. I had terrific service, although one of the chefs/waiters seemed a bit nervous when describing the dishes. No problem though! Everything was explained and questions were answered. Music was good and not too loud as some other reviewer had remarked. It a nice, intimate place for long drawn out dinners and good conversation.Despite having waited so long for a reservation, it was worth it. Unlike other places where you have reservations but then arrive and are then told apologetically that you still have to wait another 30 minutes, they seat you immediately. They take care to ensure they have enough food and don overbook.The only negative were the IKEA (literally, I think) tumblers for water and wine. All the other flatware and silverware was decent--why not invest a few more bucks in nice glasses?I am not understanding these people who are reviewing negatively without having eaten there. It seems quite evident that you need to get reservations ahead of time--many weeks ahead of time. Those negative reviews are seriously just a display of the reviewer own ignorance and unwarranted self-importance. Ahem..ONE RECOMMENDATION: If youl be going there, you should call and ask what kind of wine the chefs recommend with their food for the night! I saw a lot of people who brought red wine for the meal I had last night, but the fare was lighter and definitely white-wine appropriate. (Maybe bring your own wine glasses too! Hah)', A much more relaxed environment than Alinea or Moto, and perhaps its unfair to compare the three, but they are the only resaurants in the city that I would place in their own categories of dining experiences.Schwa had hip hop blasting from the kitchen with chefs who looked like they lived in the neighborhood they work. No waiters here, the chefs all explained their presentations well. I certainly liked the BYO as I was able to pick up some great bottles and not get killed by the surcharge that most restaurants of this caliber charge.I've never seen so many uses for raw quail egg. We had raw quail egg on kobe beef tartare and raw egg in our oxtail ravioli. While an interesting flavor, we both felt a little queezy after our dinner. I may not be cut out for a tasting judge on Iron Chef, afterall.One of the chefs explained that they were going to close down for the spring to do some culinary research in California and a few western European countries. I have not been back since it reopened, but I imagine the menu has changed quite a bit., 'I also want to compare this restaurant to Alinea but that is just not fair! It is unique and the food & flavors were delicious. It reminded me of Alinea due to the creative and inventive flavors and the choice of a 3 course or 12 course dinner.We chose to do the 12 course dinner. They were very considerate about our dietary restrictions (fish eating vegetarians) and the flavors were amazing. One course was a cauliflower puree soup with a white chocolate foam on top. It was amazing and I never thought those flavors would compliment each other so well!The guys in the kitchen do look like they live in the neighborhood and each took a turn of bringing out a course and explaining it to us. One guy was particularly jittery and that sort of bothered me. When he would explain the dish, he would rock and make nervous gestures with his hands- I found it distracting. The dessert courses were dissapointing and forgettable. Overall, it was fun. The place is so small, it really is an intimate experience. I would rec. it to friends who enjoy inventive cuisine and I think if you really love Alinea- you will enjoy Schwa!', This is one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I've had in quite sometime. I enjoy food, but am not solely a gourmet diner. First off, you HAVE to have a reservation. They are very good about returning phone calls and since the entire kitchen staff serves as the servers, the chefs, the sous chefs, the hosts etc, it's pretty impressive. My boyfriend and I made reservations a month in advance. We got in on a cancellation, so it was pretty lucky. When we got there, they were still setting up, were extremely nice and very laid back. It had a great vibe. Small, quaint, playing great hip hop and a very polite staff.We ordered the 6 course dinner (my memory is kind of bad, I went this past February, and I feel like they gave us an extra sampling of things during dinner). It was fantastic. They were very accommodating and took the time to not only name the food, but give us an overview of the food, how it was prepared etc. It could have been that we were there on the early end, but the extra time they took answering questions, giving us information on how they cook each dish was very much appreciated.The menu changes seasonally, or as they told us, whenever they want, so it's worth making multiple trips for special occasions.I just read the article in Time Out about the reopening of this restaurant and it made me love it more., We lucked out and got in on a last minute cancellation after much phone and walk-in stalking by my cohort. Utter serendipity, as it was his birthday. Schwa is brilliant.We splurged on the 9 course menu and were there for 3+ hours. The dishes were complex, stylish and- most importantly- phenomenally tasty. Overall, it's the ideal balance of sweet and savory. Their take on beer and pretzels was wildly enjoyable. It was some sort of beer brewed by monks in a land far away that was injected with cheese. Coupled with the best pretzel morsel I've ever had, garnished with a mustard chip and dill sauce. Was also wowed by the jellyfish pad thai and sea urchin sorbet (an extra course they threw in). But my 2 favorites were the most unexpected ones. First, the liver and onions which was served with a textured risotto. Sounds gag-worthy but I wanted seconds. And then the antelope (yes, antelope). Don't want to know how they got it, but it was perfect and now is my protein of choice.This is a tiny, almost dumpy spot. But it gives this fine dining extravaganza an unusual neighborhood feel that is endearing. The chefs serve each course, including the brainchild, Michael. He's the frazzled mad scientist, with veins popping, who you know is a culinary mastermind just by looking at him. The experience abruptly ended with my alcoholic friend spilling a glass of red wine that vaulted over half the restaurant. And then he fled with one of the chefs chasing after. I think I'm blacklisted by association. But am willing to sport a disguise so I can return., I have been anxiously waiting to return to Schwa for over a year now and last night was finally my night. For months I have checked the website, google searched, and actually called once a week to see when they would open their doors again. Finally a month or two back an actual person answered the phone and took my reservation!We armed ourselves with two bottles of Sauv Blanc and what turned out to be another overhyped California Chardonnay (Schwa is BYOB!). All four of us ordered the ten course tasting menu and sat back an enjoyed the eclectic hip hop and awaited our first dish. Below I have listed the ten courses with brief descriptions of each. (The chef added two courses which brought the total to twelve) amuseChilled Grapefruit something a rather with Table Side Shaved Black Truffles. This bit was served atop a glass cube and we were instructed to throw it back like a tequila shot. stone crab: bananas, celery, corianderThis dish was excellent. Baby bananas, banana puree, celery puree, a warm brioche banana thingy, and some delicious crab. It sounds a bit all over, but the flavors worked very well with one another.beer cheese soup: chimay, pretzelA very intense chimay based soup served with chimay foam, mustard skins, and a pretzel. The soup was amazing and rocked your mouth as soon as it hit your tongue.pad thaiMarinated jellyfish replaced your traditional noodles and a peanut puree replaced the crushed peanuts you're used to, but oddly it all ended up tasting like really good pad thai.artic char roe: pumpernickel, lemon, rutabagaPumpernickel blinis with roe. Yum Yum Yum.....kona kampachi: galangal, lime, mapleYum!liver & onionsNot your traditional liver and onion.antelope: butternut squash, white chocolateThe flavor combination on this dish was as odd as it was delicious.cheese Truffles and cheese cake. Hmmmmm... Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmm.dessertCandied sweet breads! Nuff said.canape: sea urchin ice creamNot sure if this will ever be part of Baskin's 31 flavors, but it was interesting. ravioli: quail egg, truffle oilI had this dish on my first visit to Schwa and was excited to say the least to see it again. Rich and beautiful!The space is warm, minimal, and TINY. I counted 24 total chairs. Despite what many say the service has been on point on both visits. Despite the lack of a wait staff the folks at Schwa are friendly, informative, and attentive. It's like the geek chic love child of Moto and Alinea! Phenomenal experience and brilliant food.4 Ten Course Tasting Menus----------------------------------------------$540NOTE TO THOSE WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN AND WROTE NEGATIVE REVIEWS:I know that it's almost impossible to get reservations, but you have to give this place a break. They only have four people working there and twenty four seats available each night. They offer a $200 tasting menu for $105 and that causes serious demand. I'm sure if they hired a hostess, a sommelier, bussers, servers, and reservations person the price would raise and Schwa wouldn't be Schwa anymore. Finally, If you want the proper wine glasses, I'm sure Schwa would be fine with you brining your own., The...most....amazing culinary experience I've ever had. I went here on a whim after a girlfriend called and said she got a random reservation there. I think the best way to go is to call and say you'll take a reservation whenever you can. That's what she did. We did the 3 course meal which ended up being more like 6 courses or so for $55. We brought 2 bottles of wine (BYOB=LOVE) and after we'd paid (4 hours after we arrived) the chef started bringing out all kinds of other wines for us to try. The food was absolutely incredible, every bite we savored. I can not wait to go back for the 9 courses. The chef and his crew were so much fun, after we got them drinking wine! :), 'Look at David W. review/lisiting of the food. We apparently went during the same menu cycle, and he took better notes than I did! I would ignore the reviews from the people who haven actually been to Schwa...Yes, it is apparently very difficult to make a reservation for this place - though I can really speak to that since my wife made the reservation for my birthday. But, the place is tiny and it is unlike any other restaurant in the city so if it is hard to get a reservation then so be it. We were there on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was full. (Keep in mind this is probably a three hour dining experience; they aren flipping the tables like it an Applebee.) I don think they care if you are pissed off because you can get a reservation - they have a lot of other folks who will gladly take your place in line. So, how good is Schwa? Well, damn good. It is certainly frou-frou food. Foams, crisps, and all of the other goodies that the top end restaurants have become so fond of... Personally, I am not a huge fan of this stuff, but if you are going to have it then have it at Schwa. We did the nine course tasting menu, and (with two bonus courses) we actually ended up getting eleven courses. We also got a bonus glass of wine. The courses ranged from exceptional (Chimay cheese soup with a mustard crisp and a homemade pretzel), to the less than wonderful (liver and onions can be salvaged in my mind), to the bizarre - dessert (candied sweetbreads, not my thing). Everything was exceptionally prepared, most everything tasted heavenly. I was particularly fond of the salad at the beginning (stone crab, bananas,etc.) and their interpretation of the beer cheese soup. The antelope, pad thai, and cheese course were also great. That being said, for $110 per person, this is probably the most affordable tasting menu that you will find for this quality and this type of restaurant. If you moved this tasting menu to one of the city other high end restaurants, then I am sure that you would add on another $65. Also, you should keep in mind that the $110 is tax inclusive. So, all in all, this place is probably 50% less expensive than some of its competitors.I loved the service at this place. The chefs serve the food, and they do it without attitude. They answer questions, they talk to you, and they are really very down to earth. Quite cool.I am subtracting one star for a simple reason - wine. Mind you, this is partly our fault. From observing people that we assumed to be regulars, the correct thing to do is to bring several bottles of wine with you and to select the wine(s) that are most appropriate for the evening. We brought one - very good - bottle of French red. It went well with two of the courses, but it totally overwhelmed some of the others. The Schwa guys did provide a glass of French white (Vouvray) with some of the earlier courses, and that helped a lot. I just didn want to be drinking a really full bodied, chewy French red with seafood - and we didn have any alternatives. Oh well. This place is truly unique. You have to try it, so keep calling. Get the reservation and go. You may not love it, but you will be glad that you went.', Very inovative. I heart this place.....great atmosphere, inovative food, byob! I have eaten at some the best restaurants in the world and the food here is fabulous and at a great price point. I also had some things I have never eaten before...jellyfish anyone? By far my favorite dish was the antelope with the white chocolate sauce and the kona kompachi. It is definately worth dining here and I will be back. I gave it 4 stars intead of 5 because I felt some of the flavors in the amuse and artic char roe weren't balanced..some ingredients were overpowering., GENIUS. And yes, I'm a sucker for a man who is as creative, downright personable and gifted as Michael Carlson is. I had the pleasure of dining in his restaurant when he first opened (some time ago, I know), but finally, after begging and pillaging (ok, so I just called 4 times a day for 13 days until someone answered to get a reservation; no one was injured, except for maybe my secretary who kept hitting speed dial), I got a reservation and had the absolute honor of dining here last night. Other than the term, GENIUS, the only other description I have is FLAWLESS. My companion and I had a later reservation so we opted to pass on the 9 courses and instead do the 3 courses. I started with the white anchovies and I can honestly say that I am now beyond that absolute horrid experience in the Rivera Maya in Mexico where I had an anchovy pizza that just about ruined me for life. Anyway... as far as a main course, I had the seared cobbia with maple syrup infused foam. I didn't think fish could taste so fresh and yet, so interesting, The flavors were pure, clean and absolutely right on. Everything had its own flavor - the fish, the sauce, the pickled item on the edge of the plate - but still complemented one another in ways that I can't really put into words. My companion started with the beer soup with pretzel roll (nothing like anything you've ever tasted, even if you've done all the beer tastings and beer/course dinners in town). His next course was the lamb with white chocolate infused foam, which he said was spectacular. This, coming from a man, who hated dining at Tru, Everest and thought Ambria was passable, means a lot. Dessert was wonderful, although I must say I've entirely forgotten what it really was. I only recall that it had caramelized sweet breads and those little nuggets were unforgettable. Who knew you could caramelize a sweet bread!?All I can say is Michael knows and appreciates that dining isn't always just about taste and presentation. His ability to combine those ideas and still fuse some import into teaching people about the values associated with texture and emotion are entirely apparent. There is a reason why F&W named him Best New Chef for 2007. He downright deserved it., I certainly can't add to anything else that hasn't already been said except to say that I wanted to make sweet love to each dish they brought out. Hard., I have just been once before this place re-opened, but the best meal of my life. Ever. Just loved the food, and loved the environment, love the BYO idea. Love that you get to interact with the chef's. Loved the music playing. Just my idea of the perfect meal.Don't love that you have to plan three months in advance, though. I actually might be in an upcoming Budget Travel issue suggesting this place., 'what to say about schwa... what i love about schwa is that its all about the food. the decor its very blah. the infusion of different tastes was great. and the way dishes were made were unique. i really enjoyed the experience. i would have liked a bit more explanation about dishes. i a foodie so i like to understand what dishes are made of and how they are prepared. i not sure if michael is the most personal individual in the world - i told him i wanted to try the 9 course since we only had time for the 3 course and i tried to get a reservation from him but he told me that they only take reservations over the phone and i let him know the mailbox is always full and he responded with well i really hope you get the chance to try the 9 course menu.... hmmm. next stop - alinea.', 'Ease up kids. For those of you bashing on Schwa business approach to not taking reservations, just calm down. Seriously. These chefs are some of the most amazing guys in the business and I pretty sure the last thing they care about is your whiny attitude. Youl get in - just keep trying. I called on a Tuesday evening and the mailbox was empty. Left my name & info and also noted that I take a reservation whenever they had an opening Sure enough, they called back three days later saying they had one for the following evening. My philosophy is that being open minded and being kind in your voicemail is key. They don want to listen to a bunch of cranky soon-to-be-customers. Market yourself, ok?Now onto the evening: absolute bliss. The whole experience is pretty surreal. A tiny home-like setting. Soft lighting. Views of the kitchen. I can really do the food justice by trying to go into detail, but it was the best Ie ever had. It was also great to have each chef come out and explain the dishes... answer questions ... or just make small talk. My friend Amy & I brought two bottles of wine - one prosecco and one pinot noir. It worked out beautifully. And for those asking if youe supposed to bring your own glassware - they have actual wine glasses now. But, I think it ok if you bring your fine crystal if that what you like. All in all - if you have any sense of upscale dining without pretension, call and be nice. Youl get in eventually.', 'I am not usually a very lucky person but I took a How well do you know your Chicago chefs quiz sponsored by Thrillist.com and became the luckiest person in Chicago for one night because I won a free meal for 2 at Schwa. It wasn the easiest feat to get a hold of someone to make the reservation but from what I know the chefs handle pretty much every aspect of this tiny restaurant including serving and reservations so the always full voicemail is understandable.Michael eventually called me to work out a reservation and when he called again the day before the dinner to confirm my reservation, he asked if I would like to bring 2 extra people to dinner on the house. AS IF I WOULD SAY NO. I scrambled to find 2 food-loving friends who were available and we got our motley crew to the restaurant the next night.Needless to say, it was one of the best dinners Ie ever had. I think that all you need to know even though it been said a million other times here and elsewhere. It kind of a bummer to read the menu on some website beforehand, just wait il you get there and enjoy it. It a pretty intimate experience because of the size of the place and the chefs constantly streaming in with plates for your table. The staff is young, friendly, probably very tired, and cute. Bring some beer for your table and for the chefs while youe at it.', I've been wanting to try out Schwa since it opened and I thought it was either 1. A hair salon 2. Some weird polish restaurant or 3. Someones house. Then I found out what was really going on up in there and my friend Megpie and I made our rez! We went on a Wednesday I was psyched just for the experience. Small little intimate room reminded me of NYC and Brooklyn, I'm not sure why--classic colors etc. The shwarmy 6 top that I almost punched in the face next to me (one guy was screaming INTO the kitchen to turn up the music, turn down the music, what is this music, hey ladies need s drink??) was the only downpoint. Soon enough they, and the gold coast cloud they came in on left. Then it was down to business. Totally personable service from the owner, wonderful explanations, great pairings or wine to food (they gave us some of theirs because the Merlot I brought would be too heavy) We rocked out, the music was sick (metal, Wutang, Gorillaz) and food amazing too. I had the brains but got a mental block 2/3 through but they tasted great. The Cheddar beer soup was SOOOO good and the antelope even better. Who knew meat and a chocolate foam could go so well together? Cheap it is not, but worth every penny if your a foodie and want to support the neighborhood and the creative types that make Chicago the bomb ass culinary capital.and to the kitchen--thanks for the hook up ;), I will admit it, I was annoyed by how hard it was to get a hold of this restaurant to make a reservation. But we finally made it through and now I understand why it was so difficult. This was an amazing meal. I was surprised and pleased with the laid back atmosphere of the whole evening. The chef's interact with all of the tables and they are all very cool. The food is difficult to put into words, you just have to experience it for yourself. We are already trying to get through for another reservation., 'Yo schwa. Why the arrogant attitude? Does it bother you how many people you are pissing off with your retarded reservation system and your inept customer service? Or do you just not really care, because you are sooooo amazing? Alinea ate too much Moto, got sick, and barfed up schwa.', My wife and I made it to Schwa last Friday evening after a long time looking forward to it. It was nothing short of spectacular. I went in with high expectations, and they totally blew me away. The menu consisted of1.) Grapefruit-Black Truffle Amuse2.) Hendrick's Gin Salad with cucumber gelee and gin/rosewater granita3.) French Onion Soup with brioche topped with melted Gruyere.4.) Jellyfish Pad Thai 5.) Off Menu Quail Egg Ravioli with shaved white truffle on top.6.) Whitefish roe with black garlic and bacon puree and poached asparagus7.) Kobia in red pepper couscous with watermelon juice.8.) Morels and Lamb Brains9.) Sous-vide rabbit with rabbit rillette and kidney10.) Green curry and rootbeer cone11.) Cheese course12.) Parsnip custard, maple syrup and lavender foam with passionfruit and candied sweetbreads.Highlights were the jellyfish pad thai, the rabbit rillette, the brioche with gruyere, and finally the ravioli, which as far as I remember, was the best thing that I have eaten. Chef Carlson brought out the white truffle and showed it off like a kid showing off his new bike. His enthusiasm for his food is clear as is his talent preparing it.We swapped some wine with the table next to us, facilitated by Chef Carlson. We had a spectacular time and look forward to returning., We absolutely loved it! The first time my now husband and I dined here was over a year ago. We were blown away by the incredible food. Then we read that they were closing down. We were so excited when they re-opened that we knew we had to go back. But then we started to get worried...was the food really as good as we remembered? How could anything possibly be that good?I am very happy to report after dining there again a few weeks ago that yes, it really was THAT good! Not only is the food outstanding, but the chefs take the time to tell you about the dishes they bring and were very welcoming to our questions about the different flavors in the dishes.Many people ask how Schwa and Alinea compare and I have to say that I much prefer Schwa. My husband and I both found the courses at Schwa much more manageable (I almost fell asleep at Alinea from a food coma) and the service much friendlier. Schwa certainly has a more casual and welcoming atmosphere that Alinea. And since it's priced reasonably we can, and will, come back again and again., Ditto with all the other 5 star reviews. My first (and possibly only?) 5 star yelper review from Chicago. I've had the pleasure of dining here several times since their opening in 2005 and each time leaves me wanting to come back for more. If you want a fantastic dining experience and don't care to be doted over by a plethora of servers -for there aren't any (and part of the whole experience), call for a reservation (leave a message and be patient!), bring your bottle of white and go to Schwa. Flavor profiles you'd think would never work, but somehow at Schwa they always do. Chef Michael Carlson=genius. Oh, and the quail egg ravioli ... need I say more?, Shockingly, stunningly good. Each course was refreshingly unique, and exceedingly successful. I'm one-hundred-percent positive that I want to eat Jellyfish pad thai for the rest of my lunches from now until eternity. My girlfriend and I went to celebrate her birthday and my recent move to Chicago. I work in the restaurant business and we go out quite often. Because of that we both are averse to putting out fellow restaurant workers, and so try to be as low maintenance as possible. That being said, we have food restrictions (i.e. allergies, vegetarianism) though we try to get dishes already on menus rather than trying to get special meals. We didn't have to worry about that at Schwa. Executive-chef Michael Carlson personally tailored a 10 course meal for each of us. Mostly it was just subtle changes in the current menu, but I didn't even ask (I figured that we would just have half the courses and that would be that) and he just created a couple new dishes for us. I brought a paired beer, wine, and spirit for each course as Michael gave me a menu 2 weeks before we dined. The staff was exceedingly friendly throughout the entire experience and I have mountains of good things to say about Schwa (and not a single negative comment) which I will mishmash-paraphrase: Musicriffic, drunkenilicious, not just bang but Ka-boom for your buck, meal. That aside, I know that a number of my friends, as well as a couple of reviewers, have been down in the doldrums because of the difficulty of getting a reservation, so I will give you, the reader, the same piece of advice that I gave my friends: You can certainly sit on your couch and call occasionally to try and get a reservation at a place that only has 5 employees who spend the entire day prepping amazing meals (and don't have much time to answer phones), or you can walk your lazy asses down to Schwa and talk to them in person. They are extremely accepting of people walking in between 3-4pm and you can usually get a reservation for sometime in the following 2 weeks. It's worth it. It's worth every imagined inconvenience and every penny spent., 'Schwa is a roller coaster of food. There are ups and there are downs, there are even twists and loops, it goes by too fast, and when it over you are left a little dazed, with part of you screaming woohoo, I want to go again! and part of you just wanting to go spend some time in kiddie-land, waiting for your heart rate to return to normal. After taking a few days to process things, I think that while there were some things that I really liked, 9 course tasting menus may not be for me (I a little weird about textures and I hate all fruit and only like certain veggies, and the cost pretty much prohibits me from doing it again for a few months anyway). But I would come back for the 3 course where I have a little more control over what I served but I can still get a feel for what the chef can do. The place is small and very intimate. You feel like you are dining in your friend house. When we were there, there were only 4 other tables sat. The chefs cook and serve so I can see why they don fill the place...and why it so hard to get a reservation. We brought 6 bottles of wine for 4 people and it worked out to be the perfect amount. Depsite my pickiness, I was determined to be adventurous. I settled in and prepared the the ride. We started with grapefruit ice amuse. Eh. I not a fan of grapefruit so I did my best to just swallow it down and move on. The Hendrick gin salad with cucumber gelee and gin/rosewater granita taught me a very important culinary lesson- I detest gelee. The menu listed beer cheese soup online, which I was super jazzed about, but when we arrived the menu listed french onion (which I hate). As it turned out, it was a corn soup that was phenomenal. I can remember exactly what was in it, but damn, it was creamy corny goodness. The jellyfish pad thai was okay. The jellyfish subbed for noodles. Once you got over the novelty, it was just a good pad thai. Then they brought us something not on the menu - ravioli stuffed with quail egg with shaved white truffle on top. Holy hell. I did NOT want to swallow, I wanted that taste to last forever. Why couldn I have 15 of those? Next it was on to the whitefish roe with black garlic and bacon puree and poached asparagus with shaved asparagus made into noodles on the side. I didn even eat much of the roe, the real star here was the bacon puree. Yum. Then came the smoked cobia in red pepper couscous with watermelon juice. Tasty. I had been very nervous about the morels and lamb brains. I did not want to eat brains! Another important lesson for me - I love brains! The brains had a thin crispy coating and were moist and soft inside, kind of the consistency of mashed potato fritters. The following rabbit dish was pretty unmemorable for me. The demi glace it was served with was really good, but the rabbit itself was a bit gamey. I totally forgot about the green curry and rootbeer cone until I read about it in someone else review, so that sums about how I felt about that. Next was the cheese course - what a dissapointment. I. LOVE. CHEESE. This was not cheese. Okay, what do I know, I sure it was cheese but it wasn good. It was like a custard consistency on the bottom topped with a caramely gelee. Ugh. Then came dessert. To me, dessert = chocolate. Candied sweetbreads, which were suprisingly pretty good, are not my idea of a good sweet finale to a meal. I was left feeling incomplete. And after 9+ courses and $280 for two people, I shouldn feel that way. I really appreciate what they are doing at Schwa. The intimate experience, the great, unpretentious service from chefs (my one complaint on the service was I felt a bit rushed, we were in and out in 90 minutes) who clearly love what they are doing and are passionate about providing a unique foodie experience and pushing the envelope of traditional food combinations and preparations. But, when it comes down to it, I a simple girl. Give me juicy medium rare steak topped with blue cheese, some fresh crusty bread dipped in olive oil, and a hunk of chocolate for dessert and I happy. I rather have a meal of simple food that I love, than have something interesting that is just okay (or in some cases, not okay).', Last Friday was my lucky day...I was invited as a last minute replacement for Rob L's and Katie and Dan's Schwa adventure. I had been looking forward to trying it forever.I love the space. It walks the fine line between home-y and restaurant beautifully. I was a little surprised by the decor at first, but as the meal started, I realized just how perfect it was for the space and the food. Unlike some people, I loved the music...I admit, it was a little surprising at first, but again, it really added to the experience in a way. Everything really came together in the end.I wont go into too much detail about the food since everyone else is doing that but I was pleasantly surprised by a few dishes in particular. I was in love with our salad course (the Hendricks gin/cucumber/rose/ coriander jelly thing) I'm a big fan of textures/temperatures and I really thought this dish really worked. A lot of the textures were surprising (like the white chocolate chard) and I really enjoyed it. I also learned that I love brains...they are like the most perfectly poached egg yolk...when it hovers between solid and liquid.I'm not sure if its because I've been to a few restaurants of this type now, but I wasn't as wowed by the experience as my fellow diners. Everything was excellent, but something was missing for me and I cant quite put my finger on it. Maybe I'm just culinar-ily jaded. Also, while my pocketbook really loved the BYOB, I think i missed having professional wine service. And while all the chefs were very nice, I like a little more explanation with my food when I am unfamiliar with it...some of them were happy to oblige - others not so much (he said he didn't feel very talkative today). Overall, it was a wonderful experience...I think it is better for smaller groups rather than bigger ones and if i came back I'd come back in a 2 some not a 4 some., This review is super late, but better late then never right? I was lucky enough to be given the opportunity to partake in a soft opening shortly before Schwa reopened. We were served a 9 course culinary avant-garde adventure. I must say, Michael Carlson, you are rockin' some shit! We were provided with wine pairings and Rhyme Sayers soundtrack, which coming from Minneapolis was a cherry on top! The food, wow...beer cheese soup, jelly fish pad thai, liver and onions, candied sweet breads with parsnip custard. Unbelievable. Shout out to Mike Noll! This place is the new wave!, without a doubt, the best meal I've had all year. Great atmosphere, cool people and utterly amazing food., 'Remember that guy that didn win The Next Iron Chef, but his food always looked awesome, Morou Ouattara? Do you remember why he got the boot? If I recall correctly (which is unlikely because I have the memory of a hand towel), it was because he always separated all the elements to his dishes, and his food was considered napproachableor equired too much work Go look on the Farrah Olivia website and youl see what I talking about. Welp (that my combination of well and yelp... As in, how you doing today? I doing welp, thanks), I think Michael Carlson may be guilty of the same crimes of passion on some dishes. Except for the amuse, the pad thai, and the cheese course (blindingly good), all the dishes required you to get all the elements on one fork, which was no easy task after like 37 courses. Btw, they don seem to like spoons at Schwa. I can understand this... The undignified nature of using the same utensil I use to scoop flaming hot cheetos and nacho cheese into my mouth may not be consistent with fine dining. Still, I found it a bit odd that they didn give us a spoon for the French onion soup (my favorite dish regardless).So I won go through the menu course by course, because I hungover as shit and I might need to go vomit (fuck you, wine!), but this was a really cool experience. I tried a bunch of things for the first time, including rabbit (I think I actually prefer Trix to that silly rabbit, not my thing) and jellyfish (which should probably be renamed jellofish, because it more like a fish made out of jello). We also had one of the most interesting deserts ever: parsnip flan with sweetbreads, some sort of foam, and some citrus element (zest?). Together it all worked. If this kind of stuff doesn appeal to you, I might say Schwa isn for you, but if youe adventurous and have billions of dollars like me, Schwa is ftw.But before I go, I have to give a special shout to yelper Rob L. who happened to be dining at the table next to us. He reminds me of myself, if I were nice, had a dope ass wine collection, and were in really good shape. He let us try his 4 Opus One and even donated his remaining 1970 Port to our table. Tres awesome.Oh, and lest I forget, I wouldn have even scored this reso if it weren for the rad gal from NoCal, Erin P. I hope youe not having reservation-giver-upper remorse now. I also like to thank god... Yeah, I know this isn an awards ceremony, but I do feel like I just won an Emmy for my role in 11/7, The Opposite of 7/11: A Food Oddity. Sorry, now I just babbling. Gosh I hungover. Save me Jebus!!!', Michael... you and your cast of kick ass chefs, rock my world. You do. I first was here about two months ago. Then, when I came back again on Friday, one of your chefs asked me if I had been there before and how similar was the menu from the first time, (and I said yes, much of it was the same), you then flipped the switch on me. You kicked it in to high gear. You took about four or five of the courses and made me different dishes then my dining companions. Some complemented what my friends get, some completely different. Still visually awe inspiring, still amazing to taste, still filled with your rock and roll, passionate and fun cooking skills. I don't mind that you called the day before to see if we could come in, I know you do it your way, that's how you all roll. Some people don't get that. They may rant about how they called you last minute, they just don't know... so.... does that mean I can have their reservation?, 'Obviously I am going to give Schwa five stars because it was THE best meal I have had since moving to Chicago. But I do want to point out three not-so-negative cons about Schwa: I felt like an a**hole when I left for shelling out $800 at Alinea the week before  I wanted to rip off my dress at the end of the meal because those guys in the kitchen are seriously hot and got me and my girlfriend seriously wastedwhich leads to my final point: hot chefs+amazing food+lots of wine= difficult to keep my ADD in control and converse with frustrated friend', HELL YES.I don't know if I understand half of what I ate, but it was all UNREAL, and a ton of fun. Also, the chef is scary as hell, and awesome. Go ahead and try to substitute a dish, and then go ahead and ask if you can make another reservation. That will spice up your evening too., I have just one word: amazing!I'll update with more when I can figure out what exactly I ate (we did the full shebang tour), am less hung over, and my head isn't swimming in awe., We had really amazing food at Schwa. Loved every single course, and just blown my mind off with the surprise course, quail egg ravioli. Sunchoke soup was my other favorite. Wow! Schwa was better than Trotter, Everest IMHO, par for par with Alinea. I also love that all the chefs, include Michael Carlson, come out and present you the course. I love that you get the words from the creator, which to me feel personal, rather than from a well-trained server.Why the 4 star, you ask?! Well, I love that it is a BYOB joint, but it comes with the price that our champagne wasn't served in a flute or that our wine needs some breathing and no decanter was avail. Of course, everyone gripe about their reservation system. I had to cancel my reservation at Graham Elliot when Schwa offered us a 9 pm table and I'm glad I did. Sorry Graham!, Wowie-wow-wow-wow. Speechless (almost). The most stunning food experience I've had in ages (similar to Alinea, but cheaper, more casual and more culinarily edgey). It's certainly not for food pussies. A great deal of the menu would be lost on a lot of people. F*cking amazing. Example: Bacon puree: tastes like prune + yeasty beef bouillon (vegemite?) + furniture polish. I know, WTF??? It works, trust me. Service is private, personal and enthusiastic. The BYOB feature is a good one BUT, I swear to Jesus they were over pouring the ladies. Hic!, Amazing. It's without a doubt the best food in Chicago (better than Alinea I thought) and the price is a steal. The quali egg ravioli is out of this world. The atmosphere is unexpectedly casual but it worked for me. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but it was well worth the frustrating reservation process., Hands down the best meal I've had in Chicago. I can't think of one negative. The chefs kept the wine flowing, timing of the food was perfect. For such a small, intimate place the energy is fantastic. What impressed me most was their willingness to break the menu and accommodate me (a vegetarian who's willing to eat a little seafood)! Can't wait until I get the opportunity to go back!, Best dining experience. Ever. I had high expectations for Schwa, and for the most part, they were exceeded. We were greeted promptly by a (super adorable) chef. He explained the menu and gave us a few minutes to settle in. It was really dark in the dining room; a little tea light would have been nice so I could more comfortably read the menu, but I had to remind myself that no chicks work here....guys tend to over look things like that :) Service was quick. We got the 9 course & the pace at first was almost too fast. Once a course was done, they reset and the next course arrived within a minute or two. I was worried our meal was only going to last an hour, but service evened out and my companion and I were there nearly 3 hours. A few courses I loved:sunchoke soup (the most velvety soup I have ever tasted)quail egg ravioli duckand the amuse was quite good too (grapefruit cells & sorbet)A few courses that were a miss:Henricks gin (I appreciate variety of elements in this dish, but it was WAY too much gelee & tapioca. Too many soft textures for my liking).The cobia was delicious, but the amount of smoke overwhelmed my palette. This was preceded by a dish that also contained smoky bacon. Two dishes in a row with smoke elements seemed too redundant. And the dessert-I would have liked to have seen it go more sweet than savory. This comes from a girl who can eat cheesecake or pie for breakfast ;)What stood out the most was their plating!!!!!!! I think I stared at each dish for a few minutes before diving in. So many components, colors, textures on all areas of the plate, including the rim. Their plates themselves were beautiful. My favorite presentation was the cobia/watermelon served in the wavy bowl vessel. So colorful!I loved the interaction with the chefs; it made the experience more personal. This place rocks. I'm totally going back in a few months when the menu changes over to spring. Oh, and I'm going with a girlfriend or two so we can drool over the chefs., 'Small area but awesome fine dining experience. Hard to get in (reservation) bc of the limit of tables but worth it! Bring mulitple wine choices for the dishes. The thing I remember most is the Quail Egg Ravioli and remember that I wanted more.', 'Ate at Schwa for the first time last night. My husband and I both agreed that it was an incredible food experience. DH is usually more of a straightforward meat-potatoes guy, so I was a bit concerned that some of the more out-there pairings would not suit him, but he couldn stop talking about how great the food was. We both had the long tasting menu, but mine was slightly tailored because I have a fish/seafood issue. (I mentioned this when reserving, and they were very accommodating, which I greatly appreciate in such a small establishment! And they did a great job of substituting. Example: in place of lobster, I was served delicious, tender pork belly instead of some boring vegetable. Tasty!) Obviously all of the ingredients seemed to be topnotch, and the different creations had been carefully formulated for maximum impact, and so it is difficult to point to any particular standouts. That said, we both loved the beet risotto and sunchoke soup. Of course, the quail egg ravioli was also incredible. The best surprise, however, was how much we liked the more *unusual* things. DH really liked the pad thai made with jellyfish, which I was afraid that he dislike. Then, of course, there was dessert. As he was clearing the table, one of the chefs heard me say (someone tongue in cheek, as I was already very full) that I live for dessert. Well, you won like this one, he said. But I was misjudged! Or perhaps he underestimated the appeal of his own dessert: a creation that contained both passion fruit and sweetbreads. Sound odd? Yes, it was, but it was also a fitting end to the menu as it wasn cloying sweet, but a nice mixture of sweet and tart and...meat. I liked it very much, thank you. There are two things that will bring me back to Schwa: (1) creative food that doesn try too hard, but is still innovative and downright good; and (2) lack of pretension. The whole chef-as-server thing worked for me very well. They were all down-to-earth, yet friendly and much more attentive than you might think given their dual role in front and back of the house.(My husband noted how quickly his emptied wine glass was filled every time.) It was a treat to be served food - and have it explained - by the individuals who created the food. When comparing Schwa to other dining experiences, as I inevitably did, Alinea naturally came to mind. Ie been to Alinea and would be fine if I never returned. However, I plan to return to Schwa - hopefully to see what they do with spring produce (peas, morels, etc.) - because I enjoyed the food more than the food at Alinea, and also liked the lack of pretension. BYOB doesn hurt! Thanks for the great dinner, Schwa.', 'So far the best meal I have ever had in my life!With ingredients like: snail eggs, lobster, truffle, beets, chestnut puree, green curry and chicken livers you really don know what to expect. Expect creativity, fun and none of the pretentiousness you might think you get.I came here for my birthday dinner with 3 friends. We had 5 bottles of wine which we left up to the chefs to pair. We did the 9 course dinner.The wines were paired wonderfully as we were brought out each course by the chefs themselves, who joked and made us laugh.We couldn figure out how each course be better than the last and were proven wrong every time! And while each plate was made up of several components, each item was great on it own and outstanding when brought together. We would take our bite and look at each other with wide eyes...Do you taste what I tasting?! My friend, who truly despises seafood, ate her lobster dish without hesitation. And another didn like beets and loved the beet risotto!The only problem with having an experience like this is the expectations that this will put on other places I go. I will be fair but it will be difficult.', 'The wife and I went to this place a couple years ago after it first opened close to our old home. We had no idea it was by reservation only (and that there was a long waiting list), but they were still able to seat us.The whole dining experience was magnificent. With unique ingredients/dishes and great service (although they seemed a bit nervous), it was one of my most memorable dining experiences. I would highly recommend Schwa, especially as an alternative to higher priced places in and around downtown.We have yet to go back since (we want to respect the reservation system this time) but hope to arrange a special evening there soon.', 'Utterly fantastic. We did the 9 course tasting menu. They threw in three extra tastes, so we ended with 12 courses for $110/person. BYOB, no corkage fee. We brought a half bottle of proseco and a bottles of Vouvray and Pinot Noir. Atmosphere: It is really just a room. 8 tables. Totally basic. There is graffiti outside and it doesn look like anything special. They were playing a mix of light electronic music and the new Q-tip album (not too loud - it was a comfortable vibe). The dining room is very sparse - 2 floral arrangements and some basic lighting. There is a view in to the kitchen through a large window. The five guys preparing the food also serve as waiters, including the chef. Husband commented that this was what it would look like if his stoner friends from HS opened a restaurant. It was crazy comfortable - the guys talked to us like they knew us and were just so excited about the food they were creating.Courses:1. Amuse: Grapefruit pulp topped with some sort of citrus sorbet andagar. It was served on this ice cube and you took it all like a shot. Abs refreshing.2: Red beet risotto. A risotto flavored with roasted beet. Brightcolor, some bull blood micro greens, a roasted/pickled beet and some beet chips topped with escargot caviar. I did not know snails laid eggs. Delicious. One of my favorite courses.3: Sunchoke soup. This was amazing. Velvety and smooth. Topped withsome sort of licorice and truffle oil and a little salad of sunchoke on the side.4. Pad Thai. This was crazy. Instead of noodles they used baby octopus. I don even know how to describe it, but it had this incredible peanut sauce (and I am not a Thai food fan), and lots of fresh basil.5. Ravioli. An extra course. This was a single ravioli filled with buffalo ricotta and a quail egg. There was a little sauce on top that was super creamy and it was topped with shavings of white truffle and parm regiano. They asked that you not cut in to it, but just pop the whole thing in your mouth. It burst and Justin and I both looked at each other after swallowing and said Il take a dozen of those to go, please. 6. Asparagus. This was good, but not one of my faves. It was a piece of house-cured white asparagus on a bed of three separate purees- fish roe, bacon and brioche. There was a bacon chip and a little salad of white asparagus. Justin thought the bacon puree tasted bitter, but we both ate everything.7. Lobster. OMG. Three tiny pieces of butter poached lobster with a salad of persimmon. I didn realize it, but I guess Ie never had persimmon. It citrusy, but super mild and delicate in flavor. Gigantic prosciutto chip on the side. Really, does it get any better?8. Chicken Liver. Almost like a pate, then they encapsulate it in agelee made of chicken liver. There was a broth made of some kind ofroot veg - rutabaga, maybe? And little rutabaga balls. And some kindof suds - I think it might have been beer, actually. Topped with a piece of peanut brittle. All in all, this was my least favorite dish and I normally really like pate. I think my issue was that it was chilled. Regardless, everything individually tasted good, but together, I wasn a fan. The guy that brought this course out was very concerned with whether or not we like it - he said he wasn sure about it. I thought it was cool how honest he was about it.9. Duck confit. NUM NUM. Three little piles of duck confit ragu on a pumpkin puree. Each pile was then topped with braised brusselssprout and a piece of grilled duck breast. Then the whole plate was topped with a shower of shaved black truffle and chocolate. Verystraight forward but intense flavor. I loved it.10. Cheese course - extra course. This was insanely good and probablymy favorite taste of the night. A tiny circular dish, about two inchesin diameter, spread with Taleggio cheese, then a tiny spread ofscrambled egg and then a crust of honey. It was like a little, cheesycreme brulee. The chef served this course and told us about how thegoats(cows/sheep(?) can remember) are herded up the side of the mountain to graze and aren given any water, then when they comeback to the farm theye milked and that milk is used to make Taleggio- it way more pungent than just standard milk b/c the animals havebeen without water for the whole day. Cruel, maybe, but delicious.11. Candied sweetbreads. Yes. Veal sweetbreads for dessert. There were three tiny pieces, lacquered in sugary, caramely goodness. A passion fruit sauce on the plate with extra caramel and a sweetened parsnip gelee. I can even describe how good this was. It essentially meat and veg, but it was so sweet and salty and perfectly desserty. 12. Ice cream. A minuscule scoop of homemade green curry ice creamatop a tiny homemade vanilla tuille cone. The cone was filled withhomemade root beer foam.All in all, it was an AWESOME experience. The portions are perfectlysized for a tasting menu. Will be back.', A good friend just took me here to celebrate my birthday. I hadn't been since it closed and reopened but wasn't disappointed. The food is still innovative and playful and the atmosphere is still casual but attentive. Food: My favorite dish was the aged risotto flavored with beet and garnished with beet slices and escargot caviar (a new luxury item, the chefs informed us). My least favorite was the single spear of white asparagus (overcooked) served with black garlic and caviar pastes. A good holdover from the pre-closing days was the quail egg ravioli which paired really nicely with vintage champagne. Service: The chefs are busy but take the time to make you feel welcome. I would have loved to have a menu so I could better remember the components (they kind of blow through the descriptions) but, hey, it keeps you wanting to come back. Otherwise, nothing was ever in want of a refill and after we had finished our meal (and two bottles of champagne) they plied us with red wine from the kitchen until we were afraid to overstay our welcome. One of the chefs even gave his coat and another, his smokes, to a customer sitting across from us. How's that for service.A few tips: Keep trying to get a reservation - I had luck calling on a Tuesday afternoon. As for wine, definitely err on the side of going lighter. The two bottles of champagne worked perfectly with every dish. This is not a place where you want to bring one bottle of cab., This is my first ever yelp review and it couldn't be more fitting that it belongs to Schwa. Had dinner there last night. First off, a huge thanks to Michael Carlson and his chefs. The guys are brilliant and it was some of the best service I have ever had. They never missed marking silver or filling a glass. We were in a party of 6 too and we never had to ask for anything or pour ourselves wine. The food was spot on. Extremely technically sound and brilliantly presented. You are missing out tremendously if you don't dine there soon., 'Well, they finally called me back. How do people get reservations at this place? Is there a secret club?I had the pleasure of FINALLY dining at Schwa last weekend. I must say that I kinda dig the joint. I loved the music, and laid back vibe. The space was very cool, but the decor needs a makeover. The service was very good but I did feel a bit rushed.The food was absolutely excellent... but all over the place. We had the nine course dinner and it just didn flow. I need to go back to make a final determination of my rating. Does anyone know how often they change the menu? I look it up online, or call them... but, well.. you know.About a week later, I was at a wine bar and the guy sitting next to me was making that awful hock a loogie sound. When he saw that he was disturbing the people around him, he would do it louder. Finally I turned around to say Do you mind!? and it was one of the Chef/Waiters from Schwa!!! He remembered me too, because I was the girl on crutches when I dined there.I wonder if he does that kind of stuff in the kitchen..', I know everyone loves this place and when we tried the 9 course menu, the food was between spectacular and spectacularly disgusting. Specifically, the cheese course was inedible. I actually had to spit it out. The quail egg in ravioli was incredible, as were two other dishes, a risotto and a sunchoke soup. The atmosphere was non-existent. It really is a bit of a dive and the service was rushed and nothing like you would get from other restaurants that serve this quality food. Overall, I wish them much success, but if I am going to spend $105 per person (without drinks), I suggest Spiaggia or Crofton on Wells. If you want to break the bank and be treated like royalty go to Alinea. I think that is the molecular gastronomy that Schwa is most like, but I'd give them a B to Alinea's A+. I'm glad I went once, but I won't be running back. And since it took several phone calls and several months for them to call me back I guess they won't be missing me either., Well worth the wait for a reservation...and officially, my new favorite place to eat in this city.The food is phenomenal...the chefs are simply brilliant. We loved every single dish of our 9-course tasting; sending the plates back (almost) licked clean. The chefs are the waiters...and the service is spot-on...our water glasses were always full, as were our wine glasses.It is a restaurant you could only find in a city and prob only in NYC or somewhere Europe. It is truly a hidden gem in that when you pull up to the front door, it couldn't be more uninviting. You walk into a tiny dining room and the front door is literally steps from the tiny open-air kitchen. This was my first visit, so I was slightly concerned, but having read all the fab reviews from those who braved before me, my anxiety was more of excitement than hesitation. And, with the first course...an amuse...they had me...anxiously waiting for the next...and the next. I was blown away...it's just that fantastic.It's BYOB, so bring plenty of wine. I did not plan accordingly and quickly realized that one bottle for 2 people was not going to make it thru 9 courses...but, the table next to us was more than happy to share theirs. We were the 8:30pm seating and after a while (time flew, so not sure exact time), they cranked the music...so, if rocking out while dining on haute cuisine offends you, eat earlier.I loved it...and you will, too, if you love food, uber-cool cooks and funky places., As half the battle here is simply getting a return phone call from Michael, my March '09 visit has to been seen as a major success...suppose it helps, too, that the meal itself was, if nothing else, entirely fascinating. That it was only slightly memorable seems irrelevant, no?I must say I found it ironic that most of the successful dishes of the night were really nouvelle concepts--see the quail egg ravioli, sunchoke soup--whose sheer conceit was richness; they seemed to contradict the whole vibe and ethos of the place. Having said that, I loved the sweetbreads/parsnip custard dessert that I presume is universally loathed: it's such a bold deconstruction of dessert in general and cracker jacks (!) specifically. I might suggest waiting until the late spring to book; the menu should be more exciting with the arrival of fresh produce. Then again, at the going rate--they are underbooking and still had 10 no-shows the night I was there--I don't see how even this place, bizarre economics and all, can last, so you may want to stick close to the ringer., 'This place is run by guys you would have seen outside of Supreme on Lafayette Street in 4, gone and grown beards and got chemistry sets to make their food in. I like to think of them as a chefs collective than a restaurant. I think restaurant is too rigid a concept to describe what theye doing here. Maybe it telling that I think of them more as a performance project than as chefs. Ultimately, they know their stuff. Don get me wrong. The big menu was $120 a head. Expensive, but you likely won be coming here more than once or twice a year for specialish occasions.And, yes, they are still listening to the Wu-Tang.', 'I really want to give this place 4.5 stars....but yelp doesnt allow for 1/2 stars. I was lucky enough to get in for dinner last night. We did the 9 course menu. My collegue/friend and his wife were dining with us - obviously they are big fans. Because my friend is sort of a regular...we did get a few extra courses (honestly we lost count but the wine could have had something to do with it). My favorite dish hands down was the quail egg ravioli drizzeld with white truffle oil - it was decadent. My next fave was the poached lobster dish with fava beans and something else - I can remember what the something else was but it was damn good. To round out my top three - the dessert which was a take on meat & veggies. Sweet breads & a parsnip custard. It was really tasty and unlike any sweet breads Ie ever had - it reminded me of caramel corn! My least favorite was the chicken liver - but that is more of a textural thing for me. The place is small and unnoticible from the outside. The chefs look like a bunch of roughnecks in the kitchen jamming out to some heavy/industrial music...and I loved it. One of the most memorable dining experiences Ie had. If you are adventurous you should give it a go.', I have read so many of Schwa's wonderful reviews so when I was invited to attend by Yelp's ever so wonderful - Rob L. to join him and some friends last Saturday, I was literally on a calendar countdown. Small and intimate, great music (sorry if you are expecting Beetoven) it's far more hip - subtle hip/hop. Service like no other place I have been to before - the chef's serve you themselves!!! This is a culinary treat and adventure. Two choices: 3 or 9 course meal - we opted for the 9 courses!!! I loved everything placed in front of me and a few times really did want to lick my plate clean. They did an outstanding job pairing the wine we brought (I probably lost count though since soooo much wine was brought). I really appreciate what Michael and his crew have created and can't wait to go back!|1
44|sepia-chicago|'This newest addition to the Warehouse District is likely to blow you away with its innovative drink and food menus, great service and ambiance that still has me thinking about it.Went here for dinner last night and I was impressed! Every aspect of our visit from making the reservation (very accommodating for a last minute reservation on a Saturday night) to being greeted warmly by the hostess when we arrived to the final nightcap at the bar said that this place wants me as a valued guest.We grabbed a seat at the bar to have a pre-dinner drink (kudos to Peter who heads up the bar for his innovative drink list and perfectly made martinis!) and took a look around. The lounge alone would be enough to make me come back. Cool tile on the floor, paneled walls and a view of the world outside beckons people to linger over one of the vintage/classic inspired cocktails. (I guessing on the vintage but they had names like drinks in a classic movie- Sidecar, Pimm cup, etc.)We were quickly seated in the center of the dining room which, while not a huge room, had several different seating configurations including a cool back table that I felt would be great for a dinner meeting or a night out with the girls. If you go, check out the drop crystal chandeliers- if left alone they might have made the space appear too formal- but they were encased in a sphere which made them seem modern and interesting. We started with one of their flatbreads (lamb sausage and tomato) which was delicious and our server told us that the sausage was made in house. We shared a few other appetizers of which the soft shell crab was my favorite. As for entrees- try the pork chop or the duck- they were both delicious and for a side-the potatoes in duck fat (wasn too sure about that) were amazing! Entrees prices seemed reasonable around $25 or so.Moving on to the wine list- while they were out of our first choice- the server quickly came up with a couple of alternatives and the Burgundy that we landed on was a perfect pairing with our dinner. Another nice thing? You didn have to spend a fortune as most bottles were under $70.Service was friendly and helpful from the top down. The owner Emmanuel (sp?) stopped by several times throughout the evening to thank us for coming and to ensure everything was going smoothly. The service team was also friendly and efficient and offered up some great suggestions.All in all? Sepia will go on my list of places to encourage friends to try. Impeccable service, great food and drink all in a lovely surrounding. Sounds like a winner to me.', I wasn't sure how to rate this, because I have mixed feelings about the place.-back table under the twig lamp: 5 stars for the ambience, even though the table was wobbly. Decor as a whole, actually, I liked, and good spacing between tables.-bourbon sour: 5 stars. yum. had boozy bing cherries to die for, and I don't even usually like cherries.-service: 3.75 stars--good, but the hipster/pretentiousness was a little bit of a turnoff. The manager came to see how we were doing, and he was very nice.-food: pork rillette-1 star. This looked like cat food with a layer of fat on top and the pistachio and pork brittle on top didn't help much. The fig preserve was okay though.  grilled crab- 4 stars for taste, but 2 for small size with big price. everyone else seemed to love their food, and their desserts. one person really loved the blueberry lemonade and it looked yummy.-hot eye candy valet parker from Serbia: 5 stars (and damn I should have slipped him my number). Also, 5 stars for the valet parker who swerved to avoid the guy driving the wrong way heading straight at my car when I handed it off). However, I was an idiot for not seeing that the lot across the street was $5, not $12. ah well. talking to the hot parker was worth it., 'The food was great (we had the pork chop and scallops), overall service was good and the decor was romantic but with a modern twist. They have a great wine selection and the waitress gave us a good recommendation. Why 4 instead of 5 stars? The waitress disappeared for huge amounts of time although the busboy and managers were very friendly and made sure we were doing okay. We ordered the crab appetizers and it was good once we were able to find the crab meat!! Such a tiny portion with a large price compared to the other appetizers. Didn get dessert because we were so full, but they sounded great and we will be saving room next timeWe couldn get a reservation so they recommended we sit at the communal table which was a long, high table with chairs all around. There was only one other couple so we didn feel like we were sitting on top of each other. Once they pick up though, a full table may not be a great idea for an intimate date. Because it is a bit higher than the rest of the tables, it made for great people watching (whose on a first date, dad and daughter or man robbing the cradle?)Overall great experience and we will be going back', 'Interesting and inventive menu...this place has promise. They really push the flat bread and all the surrounding tables, including ours, ordered one. We got the bacon, peaches and blue cheese...too greasy, but the flavor concept was spot on. Our next course...watermelon salad w/fennel and goat cheese cream...yum!...wheat noodles w/mushrooms and peas...oh my! By the time we got to our main course, we were both full... The scallops were sushi grade and tasted divine and I am not usually a big fan. The veal breast was also very good.Service was great, but the wait for our food seemed like forever...so much so that we were given complimentary glasses of sparkling ros.The lighting is phenomenal and the unique flooring gives the place a retro look...I am not impressed by wood paneling...and I think the push for brown (or sepia) is on overload.Overall, my experience was good and I will return.', really good food, nice wine list, very comfortable with a reasonable wine list; I felt they really pushed encouraging one to order the most expensive wine etc. Since the last time I ate in Sepia it has become way too noisy. When 4 people sitting at a small table leave the restaurant hoarse from screaming at each other there is a problem. As good as the food is and it is very good, the ambience wasn't. In the words of the immortal Yogi Berra - no one goes there any more its too crowded actually in this case too noisy, I was excited to try this restaurant based on the initial reviews I'd read, and to be honest, I was disappointed. Perhaps my standards have been set too high by the glut of restaurants that have graced Chicago's culinary scene recently, but the food just wasn't quite right.The flat breads are a great way to start. We tried two of the choices and both were fantastic. My friends enjoyed their watermelon salads while my quail was too heavy. The flat iron steak was just okay, although the portion was satisfying. The sea bass was served in a very small portion and didn't knock my socks off as I'd hoped.I enjoyed the wine list and the service was knowledgeable and attentive. By all means try the restaurant for yourself but try to go in with lesser expectations and perhaps you'll be pleasantly surprised., 'A co-worker and I couldn wait to try this restaurant!! We also work in the food industry and so we love trying new restaurants. We were very disappointed in this restaurant after all of the hype made about Sepia opening. To say the least, it was average. Translation, the food was boring, the decor has been seen a million times before, even the wine wall which was reviewed as extraordinary was more ordinary (I have seen homes with a bigger wine rack) the seating was not very comfortable I could go on and on!! Our server however, was the only star of the show he was excellent, but sadly, I will not return to this restaurant just for great service. There are too many restaurants in Chicago that have the total package so why waste my time.', 'I usually dread outings to hip, newer restaurants because they seldom live up to expectations, but my recent visit to Sepia turned out to be mostly excellent. The food itself would rate almost 5 stars, very little that our group sampled was in any way disappointing - portions of some of the appetizers seemed rather skimpy for the price, but the flatbreads are highly recommended - I could have been happy eating just those all evening. I followed the recommendation of the server & ordered the pork chop entree, which everyone agreed was amazing. Another surprise hit at our table was the duck fat potatoes - imagine the flavor of Hot Doug duck fat fries but in a sliced potato form - delicious!! The lemon-sage bread pudding is highly recommended for dessert. Service was great all-around.The one thing that could stand improvement a bit was the atmosphere - Sepia has a variety of dining table configurations, some more cute and/or secluded than others. The dining spaces were generally very visually appealing, but the biggest of those areas was quite noisy, sound & conversations just echoed everywhere. Some sort of sound dampening in that dining area would have made for a more pleasant experience.', 'I a little conflicted about Sepia. Couldn wait to try it what with all the press it been getting, and while we didn have a bad experience there, it just wasn as amazing as I hoped for.Our server was okay, although I got sort of an annoyed vibe from her. She seemed to think we were taking too long to decide and also that we weren ordering enough. She warmed up a little bit (more on that in a minute) but I definitely wasn blown away by the service.We started with the peach/bacon /blue cheese flatbread which was recommended as expected, and it actually was pretty tasty. Then we shared the rabbit appetizer, which was probably my favorite dish of the night. Oh, and the bread that came out at this point was really good. For entrees we ordered the salmon, the flat iron steak and the duck. Although, when they were served, my friend was presented with the skate instead of the steak. Our server quickly swooped in, realizing she had misheard my friend order, and promised to bring the correct dish shortly. Having all waited tables, we understood the honest mistake, but at this point she seemed to drop a little of the attitude. I thought it was nice that she left the skate for us to try, even though the steak came out within minutes (my friend laughed, they gave me someone else food!), and they even wrapped the leftovers for us to take home. I didn try any of the salmon or the steak, but I did sample the skate and thought it was pretty good (my friend thought it was too salty). My duck was nice, but not like, mind-blowing or anything. I was hoping for the best duck ever, and it was just...you know, good. Although it, like all of the entree portions, was quite large. For dessert we had the bread pudding and the shortcakes, which we enjoyed. The cinnamon basil ice cream on the shortcakes was also up there for the best thing I ate all night.So I don know, it was a good, maybe even really good dinner, but I just wasn wowed. I had read about the chef and manager coming around to speak to the tables, but I don recall seeing this happen. I sort of expected it after the mix-up with my friend entree, but whatever. I just think something like that would have added to the quality of the experience. I still would like to go back and try some different things (the octopus, the veal, the pork chop?) to see if those are truly extra-special. Just need someone else to pay for it...I did think it was a beautiful restaurant, for sure.', 'Sepia might be my new favorite restaurant. I had the pleasure of dining here on Friday night after hearing a lot of good things about the place and I was definitely not disappointed. First the decor - Sepia might be one of the most beautifully interesting environments Ie ever dined in... from the chandeliers to the faux leather-top tables to the sepia-hued artwork on the walls, it really a gorgeous setting. My one recommendation would be to dim the lights just a shade or two in the main dining room, but other than that, I found the interior to be pretty flawless. The food was exceptional as well. As others have noted, the flatbread is a must-try. We had the mushroom one and loved it... Il definitely try the others when I go back. For my entre, I had the lamb and it was fantastic - I still thinking about it in fact. My friend had the sting ray - yes, sting ray. Ie never seen that on a menu in my life, nor had he, so we decided that one of us had to try it (it called skate wing btw). And it was actually really good... I compare it to halibut.The desserts all sounded great, but we were way too full to try anything so Il have to save that for another time. Prices are comparable to other Randolph-area restaurants. Service was friendly and not snotty. Overall, a great addition to the neighborhood!', Really had a great experience there tonight. We popped in on the way home from work and sat at the bar, and the bartender was amazingly friendly and responsive and her vibe seemed to rub off on everyone at the bar. I don't think I've ever had so many interesting conversations with strangers before, it was like out of Cheers or something :P The blueberry lemonade was fantastic, and I couldn't let a single vodka soaked berry go to waste. The wine list was very off-the-beaten path and fairly priced (minus points for by the glass selections that weren't 100% fresh, but were quickly replaced). The food was a solid value, too, especially compared to most 'new American' restaurants in town. The bacon/bleu cheese/peach flatbread was delicious, as was the flat iron steak. The onion ring side was far and away the best batch of onion rings I've ever had, and the duck fat potatoes weren't far behind. The pork was solid, too, though not quite as excellent as the steak. Delicious chocolate crepes were a perfect capper. The decor is very well excecuted and works very well with the cuisine. All in all, aside from adding half bottles to the wine list and cooling the by-the-glass wines more effectively, there isn't anything I'd change about this place, and am going back tomorrow., My wife and I went there last night to celebrate my birthday and we were very pleased with our experience. We had a great server, worked our way through the menu (bacon and peach flatbread = very good) and left very satisfied. Overall we had a very good dinner, and definitely recommend the Lemon and Sage Bread Pudding with Sweet Corn Ice Cream and Blackberries for dessert. Just awesome. One cool feature that I didn't know about beforehand is that they have communal dining tables. What that means is that if you have two people and there aren't any reservations you can sit at an 8 or 10 seat table with strangers. Make some friends. Why not? Good food and atmosphere makes it easy to meet new people. I'm thinking we might give it a try the next time we go., 'Great atmosphere and ambience. Loved the decor. Loved our many waiters and the manager. Great wine selection. I thought the flatbreads were just okay, not great. A little greasy for my taste. We had the lamb sausage one and the bacon/bleu cheese one. Lamb sausage was slightly better. All of our appetizers were great though. We had the soft shell crab, whole wheat pasta ribbons, and quail. The quail and pasta were excellent! For our entrees we tried the veal, the pork chop (my friend loved this dish), scallops (exquisite), and salmon. Everything looked beautiful, was just the right portion size, and nobody was disappointed with their meal. We were too stuffed at this point to have any dessert, but I will def. be returning! Can I use the word great any more?', 'this was one of the best meals i have had in a restaurant. i had the veal breast, i didnt even know baby cows had breast meat. but they do, and it is delicious. the only thing i can complain about was that it was very noisy. i will be back.', 'Sepia - vintage, rustic, shades of brown - great ambiance, the decor is unique and inviting, with an earthy feel. We decided to hit it up for lunch. The service was superb, dishes were explained thoroughly and there was quite a bit of knowledge behind these explanations. Service was quick, yet un-rushed. We started with the applewood smoked bacon flatbread, which was served on a piece of natural wood. The flavors lingered and the smoky tinge remained in my wouth til the entree came. The amish chicken was sweet and juicy, there was a salty finish to it as well. The salmon was tasmanian and wild, with darker flesh that retained great flavor. The desserts were impressive also. The chocolate crepes were decadent with pistachio ice cream and figs. The mini-brown cake was sweet and savory, with a buttercream topping. The food at sepia is truly unique, all served with the freshest of ingredients and the meats are of the best quality. So far, best lunch.', Another fav' joint in the city.Good food, good vibe and a none-scary price.Flat breads are tasty, Lamb is great, Duck is wonderful.Baby Octopus as a starter is delicious and so is the Pork Rillette with figs.on the negative note - The famous veal breast? aint my cup of tea!too much fat, not enough flavor.Bottom line:Its a good place, I'll be back... a lot., Another good, but not great restaurant in Chicago. The decor is cool and the food is displayed nicely, but the meats were very fatty and lots of butter was used. The wait staff was very friendly and informative, and they did have a nice wine selection, but I that's not enough for me. I don't think I will be back anytime soon., I fell in love last night when I went to Sepia for dinner. It was fantastic. My boyfriend took me there on a date because we hadn't been out on a nice date in awhile. We'd heard good things but knew they were booked solid so that's how we ended up there on a Monday night. Let me tell you something for a Monday night, it was extremely busy. There was a wait, we had reservations, but the lady we met while heading to go home had been waiting for a bit and was getting excited looking at the food that had passed her. We told her she was in for a treat.The food was just delicious. We ordered the bacon, peach and bleu cheese flat-bread. They were substituting the peach for pears and I asked for something other then bleu cheese because it makes me ill, so our waiter gave us Gouda. Let me tell you it was fantastic. It's a great way to start off your meal. We didn't get any starters, I wanted to make sure I could finish my meal but the tables next to us got some and they looked great. I'm assuming they were excellent because there was nothing left on their plates. For our entree, I ordered the the flat iron steak. It melted in my mouth. My boyfriend ordered the veal and he loved it. I'm not a big fan of veal but I decided to try a bite and I think I might just have to order that next time we go. For dessert we decided on the caramelized apples with almond and fig jam over ice cream. It was a little piece of heaven.The decor was beautiful. I liked the rustic look and the warm vibe Sepia gave off. The waiters were outstanding. You would have thought it would have been a snooty place, but everyone was so nice and friendly. I can't wait to go back!, There is something unmistakably butch about the menu and the serving pieces at Sepia. Warmed cast iron pans instead of fancy china plates, pieces of lovingly finished wood for bread and flatbread. Meat and potatoes, gussied and fussied up. Yup, don't be fooled. This is rib-sticking boy food, neatly disguised.Not able to get a reservation on a weekend or weeknight? Not to worry, there's a fairly massive bar area with plenty of tables where you can order all the same things that the lucky reservation-getters get. Got it? Show up early and you're likely to be seated right away. On a recent Friday night, there were tables a-plenty in the lounge and everyone who walked in was offered a seat. Cocktails are the show stopper here - infused gin and vodka rule the menu, which features twists on old classics, familiar favorites, and fanciful new beverages. I loved my cocktail, it was one of the best things with alcohol I've put in my mouth in years. No joke. It was a pear something or another and the crushed ice cubes in it offered a pleasing counterpoint to the lemony-peary burn. I just wish the rest of our meal had been as wonderful as the drinks.We ordered a flatbread for the table, and it was sublime. More a cross between a bruscetta and lavosh than a pizza, the flatbread was covered in sauteed mushrooms, green garlic, and sea salt. It was amazing. A plus is that they serve some hearty whole grain bread from Bennison's, which is rightfully considered one of the best -if not the best - bakeries in the Chicago area.The table also tried the octopus, which was so good I'm still thinking about it right now. Grilled to delicious tentacle-y perfection, it is tender, chewy, and a touch smoky. Lovely. We didn't love the avocado-cucumber soup, which to me tasted of the summer, not early fall. It also needed a little more salt...just a few grains would have been more than enough.With our entrees we ordered the onion rings and the duck fat potatoes. We were underwhelmed by both. The onion rings were a perfect study of how an onion ring should taste - when you order it at a fast food joint. They were not memorable, just well-made. The potatoes were more soggy than crisp and tasted like they belonged on a brunch menu. I'd take Hot Doug's duck fat fries over these any day.Our entrees were fine. Nothing to write home about. We had the salmon, served with baby carrots and barely-cooked watercress. It was unremarkable (suffice it to say I've been eating wild-caught salmon out in Seattle this fall and Sepia's salmon, of course, didn't compare in freshness -- or preparation). Chicken was tasty, but it was chicken. For dessert we shared the crepes. They were tasty - covered in a bitter chocolate sauce, how could we not have liked them? The ice cream served alongside was also quite good.Our server was wonderful. She knew her way around the menu and made us feel at ease. She was unobtrusive but attentive. I will go back - I'd like to try it again when the winter menu is in full swing. Until then, three stars. Yes, I'm hard to please. And Sepia does have the potential to convince me that they do deserve another star.Update:Went here for dinner again hoping to add another star to the review. One of the worst meals I've had in a long time - horrible wild rice 'risotto' (apparently it was supposed to have vialone nano risotto rice, but I could find nary a trace) finished with dairy that seeped all over the plate, cold kale, tasteless squab with the fattiest skin I have ever had. I was truly disappointed by the quality of food.Service continues to be good, but not good enough to make up for the food. Minus one star., I'm a big fan of organic, sustainable food esp coming from the Bay Area where we have it in abundance and it is part of the dining culture. When we heard about Sepia (they use sustainable and organic ingredients) , we knew we had to go while we were in Chicago. We had Sunday brunch their before we left to go home. I had the eggs benedict with berkshire pork belly and honey mustard hollandaise. It was tasty comfort food, like being wrapped up with a warm blanket, which was perfect that windy day (the wind in Chicago is no joke!) My boyfriend had the fish version of the eggs benedict ( I forgot it it was salmon or halibut) equally good. We were so stuffed that we didn't have room to order the potatoes in duck fat which I heard was one of their signature side-dishes.A couple of slight mishaps, service was a little sloppy- a faux pas when my plate was removed before my boyfriend was still eating. Also, our waitress didn't know if they had a separate dessert menu. Otherwise, service was friendly.One last note, I loved the decor, and use of space esp the mixture of communal tables with the regular tables, the exposed bricks. Chicago has a great dining scene, and could give SF and NY a run for their money., Fab food,and great ambience sums up this place. I had the blueberry lemonade and it tasted like crap sorry its the truth. The appetizers were ok, we had the flatbread and the soft shell crab. The best thing about this place are the entrees, the porkchop is one of the best porkchops ive had, even better than boka's porkchop I dont really eat pork but I was peer pressured to try it boy do i love it and I have this craving for it every now and then. Its a good size porition and it will really fill you up. I like the fact that this place does not give you stingy poritions like other hip places. The decor is modern, the service is good (not great) and the entrees are just really delicious. If the desserts and appetizers were as good as the entrees then I would have given this place 4 stars., 'Definitely a decent restaurant, but I doubt that I will go back anytime soon. Maybe my expectations were too high, but the food was good (especially the flat bread!), but not great. Decor was cool, but there are so many other restaurants that are are superior.', after looking thru yelp reviews I decided to ck out Sepia when I was in Chicago. unfortunately I had a very late lunch that day so when it came time for my reservation I wasn't very hungry :-( I did try one of the flatbreads- foraged mushrooms & green garlic - YUMMY! not too heavy. I regret not ordering the Berkshire pork chop w/ wild onions & cassis vinegar after overhearing the bartender recommending it to someone else but I wasn't hungry enough. my client ordered it and she said it was delicious, a nice portion too. I ended up getting a salad and the whole what pasta ribbons w/ foraged mushrooms & squash blossoms, appetizer size which was tasty. I will def be back to try the pork chop next yr., 'There was a lot of pressure on this place to really step it up to get a good review. I tried for weeks to get a reservation on a Friday or Saturday night, but to no avail (unless I wanted to eat at 5:00 or at 10:00). I decided to make a reservation for a Sunday and was able (two and a half weeks in advance) to get a reservation. Then they called the day before to confirm that I still wanted the reservation. Not only did they do this to remind me...I had to call them BACK to really confirm that I would be there. A little overkill I thought...When I showed up at the restaurant and they said we are waiting for a few tables to turn over..would you like to sit at the bar while you wait... I thought: Oh HELL no! I made a reservation three weeks ago, they better not make me sit here for long...blah blah blah...you know...you have all said it before!!Then I realized, in my excitement, that I was ten minutes early. Okay, my bad.They were able to seat us at our reserved time. The place was packed! For a Sunday I was really impressed. The decor is very interesting because it combines the old feel of the warehouse district with a modern flair. Not only does it capture the ruggedness of the old days of the warehouse markets, but it also captures the classiness of that era as well. They have brown Sepia-toned colors( I know...surprise surprise!) in the room as well as antique chandeliers, but they also have modern-style furniture. Great space. The mirrors even look like they have been around for decades. The service was great. Lisa B was our waitress and she greeted us with a nice smile, took a water order, and left us to the menu and wine list. There was no pressure to hurry and order and there was no pressure to decide on something to drink right away. They have a wonderful wine list full of selections from the US to Lebanon to South Africa. I was deciding between two Shiraz and Lisa B suggested one from South Africa. Again, she went and got our wine before pressuring us to think about what to order. When she had returned with the wine we were able to ask about the entrees. This is where she came to life. She was able to speak to all of the entrees on the menu. The only problem: She didn have anything BAD to say about them!! Didn help us decide. Once we directed her to some choices we had been toying with she directed us towards a good way to go. And she was spot on! I will get to that later.We ordered flat bread with apple wood bacon, cheese, and apples as well as a mixed green salad with seasonal veggies. Both were absolutely wonderful. The flat bread came on this serving plate that was a slice of finished wood...like we had been camping and used nature as our serving dishes....You know ause I do that ALL the time...make apple wood bacon flat bread while I am camping...Anyway.And our entrees:I had the sturgeon...I almost ordered the skate, but the Lisa B really convinced me to get the sturgeon and I was very pleased. It was perfectly cooked and well-seasoned with lots of flavor. My boyfriend was between the flank steak and the short ribs and Lisa B came through again with a great recommendation for the braised beef short ribs. It came with a herb noodle pasta and caramelized pearl onions. The meat was cooked perfectly, melted in your mouth and their pasta is homemade and was delicious!! Then there was more...even though we were full we felt we had to go there (and probably should have ordered only one)...Dessert. My boyfriend had the banana bread pudding and I had the cranberry upside down cake. Both were delicious, but the bread pudding was not sweet enough for my boyfriend sweet tooth. All and all, it was a great dining experience. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was a nice place to spend a few hours. I will definitely go back and will recommend it to others.', I went here for lunch with the office team. What was nice is that they accommodated a party of 10 on short notice, and they were still pretty full. The atmosphere is really well done and the chairs are more comfortable than they look.The service was a little strange. The waitress asked who the host was (the COO from our head office) and then ignored him for most of the meal. In fact, even made a statement to him that she was going to take his order last because he was the host. He was a little taken aback. She also forgot to smile at anyone.I ordered the special soup and one of the salads. The soup tasted okay but it was not hot! And the salad had tomatoes that tasted old. Besides that, there were no veggies in the salad at all (except lettuce) They never asked me how my food was so I never could relay this information back to them. Also, the bell staff and water refillers were very invasive, I felt there were arms around me throughout the entire meal, moving things and refilling things.The others thought that their food was just okay. The burger was undercooked for one of the people, the steak didn't have a great flavor and the fish was too salty. Nice atmosphere but sloppy chefs and service would be my final assessment., I went to Sepia last night with my wife and another couple and i can't wait to go back! My wife and I were doing this detox diet so only vegetables and chicken or fish. Our server was very helpful and very accommodating to our dietary needs that night. I can't wait to go back though to try the potatoes cooked in duck fat, the elk or one of those tasty libations. The only complaint I had was the tea was over-brewed - no biggie but they carry this awesome brand called T., Decor and atmosphere first, food second. I really enjoyed the look of the restaurant and the bar. The warm colors, modern style of the furnishings and visible elements of the building's age work well together. The booth style bench I sat on had me sitting forward most of the meal; that was the only discomfort of the meal.I made reservations for my husband and I a little less than two weeks in advance. The only opening besides something like 5:30 was 10:15, and I went for that. We were celebrating his birthday and this sounded like just the place for him. The food was delicious-we did the popular flatbreads and octopus for appetizer-and nicely presented. The only hitch was that my husband's entree was cold-and not supposed to be-on arrival.Service was lop-sided. Our seating must have been one of the last of the evening, but we never felt rushed or pushed out. The waiter was very helpful with explaining the restaurant concept and menu items. However, she and the bussers were awful at clearing plates, refilling water and wine service. We had to put our long-finished app. plates on another table to fit the entrees on the table. Also, a busser used a spray bottle all over the table next to us and some of it floated over to our plates. Eww. Overall we enjoyed the dinner, but I wouldn't write home about the experience., 'I had a bad experience. The waitress ignored us except when she wanted to teach us about the wine we ordered. My lamb was very tasty but was cold so I needed to ask them to warm it up. They never cleared our appetizer plates and they started cleaning the table next to ours with windex which got on our food. They need to tighten up their service...', 'Mostly a very favorable impression:+ smaller dishes were inventive and thoroughly prepared...+ ...entrees equally impressive without being superficial+ attentive and knowledgeable waitstaff+ decor- inattentive and disorganized hostesses- seating area optimized for profit instead of comfort- delivery to table could be quicker, as indicated by temperature of some items- music was not value-addedAgain, Sepia delivered an admirable performance, though they need a bit of time to work out kinks and polish themselves. We started with an uplifting portion of apple/bacon/bleu (spelled blue on the menu) cheese flatbread. I had myself the braised short ribs, which weren entirely remarkable in that they were a shade dry/tough, and the imbued flavors were a bit too subtle for my liking (that may appeal to some, however). The lady had herself a medium-rare-cooked elk chop, which came to the table medium rare (sad to see that even doneness instructions are something to take joy in nowadays). Bang-up job on that--flavorful without being too gamey, and the flavor itself ran no risk of tripping up over its own complexity. Potate in duck fat was about as good as it sounds, and the squash in maple syrup was well-balanced.I be keen to pay another visit once the menu changes, or once they get the lamb sirloin again. One last thing--on three occasions did the hostess ask to take our coats, and three times we declined. That sort of interchange should never happen.', Everything about our experience at Sepia was worth raving about. The service was excellent, we were seated immediately for our reserved time, the ambiance was warm, the food was delicious and the wine was very good. We went with many of the raves from other Yelpers for our food selections, and they didn't miss - the mushroom flatbread, the grilled octopus appetizer, the pork chop entree and the scallop entree were all wonderful. I highly recommend Sepia, but don't forget to make that reservation in advance!, 'After too many evenings passed without a trip to Sepia to sample the latest, trendy eats, my time has come! I could ladle it on thick here, but if you take nothing else away from this review, you should know this:GET THE ELK CHOP. Yes, Elk! If all red meat tasted like elk (and my dining companion reminded me that the texture and consistency--not marbly, was similar to a filet mignon), I would eat it. ALL THE TIME. The words, Why order dessert when you can order a second elk chop? actually came from my own, die-hard, dessert-fiend lips. It was not: gamey, rubbery, sinewy or tough. The elk chop was like buttaThis is a FOOD experience. If you go here with any other agenda, you will be sorely disappointed, as the evening will most certainly be consumed by the true star of the evening: the food you order. The flavor combinations are inventive and tasty, I was impressed by the pork rilletes (pate-texture), both taste and presentation. Overall, menu: to be experienced! We were most impressed by the bacon, bleu cheese and pear flatbread (albeit a bit rich), the pork rilletes and the Elk chop, of course. While the scallops were delicious, the broth and vegetables accompanying the scallops were forgettable, not complimentary in flavor and remained mostly untouched; while the poached quince dessert wasn terrible, I think Il take our server suggestion next time and go for the roasted banana bread pudding...Seating: We took a reservation in the lounge over a communal table in the dining area. Happy with the choice, except the tiny, itty-bitty, two-top barely held our small appetizer plates and glasses, let alone the bottle of wine, candle and more than one appetizer dish at a time--to the point that the busser tried to bus away what must have been a home made bread plate and nearly saw his life flash before him when I tried to reclaim the bread from his quick hands. Hopefully, the lounge has since caulked the gaping hole in the wall to the outside that lead to an exodus from the adjacent table along the wall as the draft was uncomfortably cold. If I had a large group, they had two secluded rooms toward the back of the dining area that looked cozy.Service: Our server was prompt, great personality and brought over a sample of a delicious pinot noir without our prompting when we were overwhelmed by an extensive wine menu. We were sold! She also lead us to the elk selection as well. I believe her when she says that everything is terrific and awesome on the menu, but perhaps taking a little more time with us to tell us about the menu--we were in no hurry, her area was empty but steadily filling up and wee investing in the food and experience. She was a little quick to leave us to fend for ourselves with the menu, but like another reviewer noted, not at all pushing us to make a decision or rush through our meal. Bottom line: If you like food, you will like, perhaps love, Sepia. Il be back.For my second elk chop!', I went there for dinner with my uncle and had a wonderful experience. He ordered octopus, which I normally have a very strong dislike for, oh wow, was it amazing. We had an anchovy app which was nice and I had fish for dinner, which was a little on the salty side, but I'm willing to over look it. On the plus side, the bartender made my dirty martini perfect., I have never had dinner at Sepia but lunch is consistently underwhelming. The ingredients are good, but the food is not particularly inventive and has only been good, never great. The portions can be silly small. The flatbreads are tasty, but I have now seen everything on the menu ordered at least once and never has anyone raved. Most of the five star reviews seem to focus on dinner, so I'm guessing the lunch chef just doesn't have the same flair. If you are looking for a pretension with your lunch, you'll find it at Sepia but would be better off at Blackbird., Great new restaurant. I went the first time for a wine tasting. Second time for a friend's birthday. The bacon flatbread is awesome. Wonder where they get the bacon. So flavorful !! It's not huge, but quality over quantity, next time I'll order 2 because it's so good. There website is pretty cool too, check it out, 'Amish chicken was good, but a bit blah. Service was a little off. Decent ambience. Kind of a Custom House Lite. Go to Custom House instead.', Oh Sepia, you are trying so hard..... and we all want you to succeed.... but it's just.... off, somehow. Went on a Wednesday night in December, our reservation was for 9:00pm. Ok, now, we did arrive about 5 minutes early, but still, we had enough time for a leisurely glass of wine in the bar before being seated. And when we got our table? Man oh man, is that place ever n o i s y. Strike one.Apps and entrees were quite tasty, with particular kudos going to their soups and fish dishes. The service, however, needed some work. Our waiter had an uncanny knack for being in our faces while we chatted and looked at the wine list, then disappearing completely once we were ready to order and again when we were ready to pay the bill. Also, we detected a bit of, hmm, is that... condescension in your voice? Strike two.Desserts were a complete let-down. Don't waste your time or money. Strike three., Everything was very tasty, wine list was extensive, service was quite good, drink from the bar was yummy. We may have been there on a slower night, but the noise level was fine. I'm not sure what was missing to give it a 5 star rating, but it just wasn't somewhere we'd probably return to. Nothing was wrong, but nothing is really encouraging me to return.... if that makes sense. We had the mushroom flatbread (delicious), charred octopus appy (really, really good -- and a surprising meaty taste -- I was expecting something of the consistency of calamari. It was very tasty), elk chop, and roasted hen, followed by the cheese plate after dinner. Oh, and the potatoes fried in duck fat --- yummmm. Maybe a more extensive list of entrees would make us return, I'm not sure. Certainly worth one trip though., 'I liked Sepia and I thought ONE thing right when I walked in....SEPIA, IT REALLY IS SEPIA. If you stay too long, you think something is wrong with your vision. Youe truly seeing in Sepia.But anyway, everything LESS than our experience with the door staff was great. If I had to base my review on my first 35 minutes inside this restaurant, I would give it 0 stars. In fact, I almost didn try the place because of the borderline short bus status of the two girls at the front door.My friend Matt and I had both put in a long day, he had just gotten out of school and I had just left work. He phoned around 9PM and asked, are you hungry and I was, so I met him at Sepia around 9:30 PM on a weeknight. There was a convention in town, so they were busier than usual but we wanted to be seated in the lounge and even with TWO OPEN TABLES the dumbbell hostesses couldn pull it together. Neither one of them made ANY effort to get someone to clean the two tables that sat open for about 15 minutes until finally Matt wanted to ditch the place. I turned to dumbo #1 who was clearly ruling over dumbo #2 and said, can you get someone to clean that table because we would like to sit now or wee leaving. It was only then that she sensed any urgency at all.Anyway, once I got over it, we tried their flatbreads which were to die for. I am not an entree eater, I prefer multiple small courses and usually order two to three appetizers over a main course, but the server insisted I try an entree. Nothing really appealed to me that was left on the menu - they were out of two items and I was allergic to one. The server pushed the short rib on me and I buckled under pressure - it was mediocre. Overall, I would say it is worth a try. Go on a weeknight if it truly has gotten to be too busy or overly loud - if that bothers you. I think going to a restaurant is a social event and I prefer the loud, fun atmosphere but if you don - go on a Tuesday!', I did have an OK lunch here --- but I don't think it lived up the all the hype I've been hearing...Started off w/ a two flat breads: one pear and one salami. Both were exceptional. Also had a chance to sample the cheese platter --- which was amazing as well....but I guess the server didn't understand that we needed more bread...Bison burger for lunch. Just OK, but cooked right. Could have used a little salt.The duck fat potatoes that were served as a side were a little blah...and made me feel disgustingly oily all afternoon, as if I didn't shower or something. Gross.Atmosphere was nice. Love the shaded chandeliers and crazy print-shop vibe...especially that large brown metal door.  I would like to come back here for dinner sometime to see what it's like. The circular, more private booth/room w/l the huge wickerish lamp looked cool. I saw a lot of wine on the wall racks, and something tells me that they do wine right...but we'll see..., 'I give this place 3 stars - and that being generous. I was pretty disappointed at this place, esp. after waiting months to get a reservation. Maybe it was the whole lunch thing that didn cut it...We came in a group of over 10 during lunch hour - the decor is nice, I loved the wine racks as decorations, and the crispy noodle lamp shade in the private dining booth. We started out with flatbreads (with sausage/fingerling potatoes) which in theory sounded good, but didn end up being that great. That pretty much summed up my entire experience - satisfactory for a good lunch, but nothing inspiring. For my entree, I had the bison burger with duck fat fries - sounds good, right? Like the flatbreads, they were just good/ok, nothing to write home about. How can you not impress with duck fat fries?!?I MIGHT be back for dinner (not on my dime) IF there no wait. Il need a whole lot of inspiration (free meal?) to go back.', I was disappointed in Sepia after been dying to try it for months. We came for lunch (in a large group) and I was totally digging the atmosphere and decor. The huge wine racks on the wall? I want for myself. The light fixtures? Awesome. My lunch? Okay.We ordered the flatbreads and the cheese plate to start. The flatbreads had meat on them so I didn't try, but the cheese was pretty good. Just not enough bread to go with it. I had the kampachi, which was a light fish entree perfect for lunch. Unfortunately, it was a little salty. And I don't do salt.I'd come here again and try dinner, but definitely not if I was paying :), So disappointing! Sepia is definitely the hot place in town right now (reservations are tough to get), so I was expecting something extraordinary. But I was extremely let down.Thumbs way up for decor, service, bar, and great drinks (try the Sepia Mule -- a refreshing ginger-based cocktail).Thumbs WAY down for food. And let's face it, when you're going out for dinner, it's the food that counts, right? We started with a selection of flatbreads -- not easy to eat, but tasty enough -- and the ribbon pasta with shellfish, which was basically fettucini alfredo with some salad shrimp. For entrees, the menu wasn't very exciting and none of us at the table were really dying to order any particular entree. We settled on the kampachi, the braised ribs, and the sturgeon. All three dishes were salty and unmemorable. The kampachi in particular was just a piece of fried fish that you could find at any mediocre restaurant on a Fish Friday. Dessert was just as bad. The pistachio ice cream was FLAVORLESS. And while the ice box cake was beautifully presented, it was IMPOSSIBLE to eat: We had to ask the waiter for a knife to cut through the cookie-type crust and even he couldn't cut through it. The plate ended up being an unappetizing mess that tasted good but was too sloppy to eat with any decorum.Sepia may be the trendy place to go, but if they don't get their food right, I have no doubt that it will fall out of the cool crowd pretty quickly. You're much better off at Aigre Doux or One Sixty Blue -- same hip atmosphere, but MUCH better food., 'I had one of the best dining experiences ever at this place. Our waiter was very attentive and made great suggestions but wasn overbearing. I have a shellfish allergy and he really took care of me and let me know what my options were. The food was delicious. We got a flatbread starter, which was really good-- how can you go wrong with bacon, cheese, and pears? For an appetizer, I had the baby octopus. I am not usually too crazy about octopus or squid, but these were so amazingly tender! I have never tasted anything quite like it. For the main course, I had the elk, my boyfriend had the scallops. We got duck fat potatoes-- they were as delicious as they sound. We went on a Friday night and we didn even have a reservation. They sat us at the communal table but it was still pretty intimate-- no one was seated right next to us. Finally, I really appreciated the atmosphere-- nice decor, which was unique but not over the top, perfect amount of lighting.', 'To start, I had the charred baby octopus and it was very good! This is a nice date place, although our waiter was a little off, we definitely made the most of it! I had the sturgeon which was fantastic and I definitely tried my best to show my date I knew what that meant (although I had no idea, I knew it was some kind of fish? lol). Try it! Just look at the menu before hand. : )', I went to Sepia with some girl friends for dinner and Sepia has a great atmosphere. A mixture of old school decor - (picture rustic wooden bar when you first walk in) but as you go further back into the dining, the large crystal chandeliers in the middle of the room brightens up the back and Sepia is transformed from old western/rustic to modern sophistication with leather chairs and tall long tables. I started out with the sunchoke potato soup - I was a little disappointed, it didn't wow me as much as I thought it would. It was good basic potato soup but from the description and price, I thought it would have swept me off my feet! My friend and I shared the Elk steak - served medium rare. It was awesome, cooked to perfect, it came with sweet potato and butternut squash cubes. One of my friend got the porkchop and the skirt steak - both were also very good. I had a great time at Sepia and can't wait to go back!, Left here last night with an overall lukewarm experience. I'll explain: Menu choices were basically limited to only a few flavor categories: gamey-greasy, greasy-gamey, tart-gamey, char-grill, etc. We had a party of 10 so I had a chance to try almost everything, and only a few of the dishes really stood out as spectacular on what was otherwise a very inventive, but limited menu. Awesome top-shelf bar, and the waitstaff and hosts seemed to really be professionally interested in what they were doing. Just thought if they were shooting for the ultra-high-end dining experience they fell short on the execution of the food itself, but Sepia is on par otherwise. Great parking for $5 right across the street., 'We had the worst meal in years at a newcomer to the West Loop called Sepia.Before we were served any food or drink, four different people visited our table to ask who we were (I think they wanted to know if we were food critics or not) before a manager came and told me that Photos were not allowed. I had brought my Nikon D80 to take pictures, as I always do.I am certainly not a food critic (read below if you want proof), just a typical consumer. Perhaps if we had said we were writing a review, we might have been treated better..The service was ok, once we let the waiter rattle off his spiel without interruption. He was initially nnoyedat us for daring to ask questions, but eventually he warmed up, and was ok. Ie waited tables, so I know how sometimes customers can be irritating for no particular reason. The bus buy in charge of our table hovered nearby, refilling our water every 2 or 3 minutes. Perhaps they get a bonus if they sell more than one bottle of water? Grade: B..As mentioned, was told firmly there would be no photographs allowed, per olicy Not sure what that about. Perhaps afraid of proof of bad reviews? Grade: F..Atmosphere, not quite to the level of the home of a tribe of serial killers, but still kind of freaky. I wonder how many folks ever return to have another meal? I could easily visualize ritual sacrifices occurring in the basement. The tables are crammed up against each other, you can borrow napkins from adjoining tables without even turning your torso. We ate early, so most of our meal enjoyed a buffer, in three dimensions, but the staff constantly bumped against our chairs, or stumbled over our feet. Sepia layout obviously was not approved by a Feng Shui master.Food:.Flat breads: sauteed mushrooms on a homemade cracker. Profit margin of 99%. I calculate the ingredients as 1 mushroom diced (perhaps 2, of different varieties, but hard to tell), some butter, some oil, about .05 of a garlic clove, and a bit of flour and water. $7. If I made this, even if I was more generous with the amount of mushrooms, and if I didn have the benefit of economy of scale, still would be hard to spend $0.25 on the dish. After the 300 word buildup mouthed by our waiter (and probably written by the owner), I expected more. Grade: D-..Salad - a handful of moldy lettuce, or perhaps a sour vinegar dressing. Served with cold, marinated grilled carrot strips, of there must have been a surfeit, as these same carrots appeared in all our other dishes too. Grade: F..Fish - a nice chunk of sturgeon, cooked to the consistency of leather. Yummm, chewy! Served on a bed of watercress, with mold- marinated carrots. $26 dollars. Grade: C-..Grilled vegetables. Actually not bad, the only thing we completely finished, though again, 20 dollars for a couple ounces of grilled/baked vegetables (squash, carrots, brussels sprouts, red cabbage) seems a little steep, especially since nothing was organic or locally grown. Sysco vegetables are pretty damn cheap. Perhaps the kitchen staff has a very competitive pay scale, or perhaps there are too many of them, or perhaps the rent is not favorable. Or something. We were hungry about an hour after leaving Sepia, and had to have a second dinner..Goat cheese cake, cloyingly sweet, but not bad. Served with a bitter, insanely dry cookie, and one lonely pistachio nut, crumbled, and spread out across an over-large plate. Actually, I think it was less than one pistachio nut, perhaps 1/4 of a whole nut. Whatever. We left most of it uneaten, lonely on the vast plate. Allegedly the desert chef is going to be featured in some food magazine, but that is no guarantee of quality, just evidence of payola in the corporate media. Grade: D+.Final Grade - are you kidding? We didn even drink wine (contrary to my habit), and our bill was still over $100. If I want a special, delicious, romantic meal, and am willing to spend more than $100, there are several options to choose from in Chicago. Sepia is not one.', Must agree with some of the other reviews. Went here in October and although it was good I wasn't wowed by anything. You really want to love it, I mean the space is awesome, the waitstaff is great, but the food was forgettable. Our favorite part of the dinner was the cheese course, yummy, I heart the homemade chutney. I will be back for cocktails and apps., 'Unique menu, but pricey. Flatbreads were great, but with so many restaurants in Chicago - there are other better options. Great atmosphere.', I was so excited to try this place and it was ehh...okay. nothing great at all. the bread was hard, the salad was boring and has WAY to much vinegar salad dressing. nothing great except the octopus, of course. the drinks were way over-priced and the room is a little too much for my taste. it does get loud, but it is a nice change of the stuffy high end restaurants. the staff is having fun and relaxed, and you can tell-which is refreshing. glad i tried it, won't be returning., 'Went here last night with some friends for some much (MUCH) deserved cocktails and had a pleasant time. I happily imbibed the following potent libations: The Green Monster - my first absinthe, hehBlood and StoneBlood Orange Pisco SourPatron Silver on the rocks (tried and true)We also got a cheese platter and they were tasty, but lacked diversity, in my humble not-a-cheesemonger opinion. I liked the rather dim atmosphere - made it seem quite intimate. I also appreciated the creative lighting fixtures and the very cool bathroom. Everything was dark woods, dark greens, cool neutrals, handsome decor...a very relaxing, peaceful place. I also noted that although we were seated right up by the windows, there was nothing in the way of a draft ,which was surprising, given the age of the building and apparently keeping of certain erioddesign and decor.The service was pleasant and timely. The cocktails were strong but well-mixed and it was obvious that the barkeep took the appropriate care with each drink (as he should, as they are rather pricey).The only somewhat off-putting element of my experience was no fault of Sepia; the majority of the clientele in the lounge area were dripping with snobbery! I a happy girl; I like to laugh, and while Ie never been told my laugh was particularly loud or obnoxious, I got the DEATH GLARE from a smattering of seriously ultra-chic yuppies. See, Matilda, THAT how you get laugh lines. Shel be a shar-pei by the time she 30.My GOD!Loosen up, people! And wear some color, you all seem to be in mourning for your sense of style! Lots of unhappy-looking rich professionals in their 30s and 40s all in black, vapidly dissecting their latest divorce or scheming how to best undermine their banker husband secretary...unattractive. But, it not terribly far from the financial district and there are new trendy condos popping up everywhere around there now, so it makes sense that I would see this particular type of urban vampire in this area. Overall, it was a good experience. I will probably visit after work again and maybe dare to wear some happy, spring-y color and toast all the death glares.', 'I went here for a business lunch yesterday and was pleasantly surprised. I read about the restaurant when it was reviewed in the Tribune months ago, but it wasn memorable enough for me to stop in. The overall decor was very sepia toned with pretty chandeliers outfitted in clear glass cylinders located throughout the open space. The dining area was fairly modest in size, so I would not come here with a large group. As a group of only 3, we dined here very comfortably.The vegetable flat bread was absolutely delicious! The next time I come here I will order two of these for an entree and call it a day. This time I ordered the bison burger for my entree. It was also very tasty with medallion sized potatoes as the side. I just have to say that the flat bread was definitely the highlight of the meal.I took one star away due to the waiter being a little slow. We had to remind him that we were ready to order our entrees, and he took a long time coming back to our table after the flat bread appetizer was served.Overall, I would come back here based on the quality of the food.', 'Over the past few months I have tried with some conviction to get reservations at Sepia. For some reason or another it has never worked out. Finally, on Friday Audrey and I walked in and scored a great seat in the lounge. We started with the Wild Mushroom and Garlic Flatbread. It was good. Sometimes things that are very simple can be produce amazingly complex tastes. However, this tasted exactly as the menu described it. We also ordered a side of the Roasted Brussel Sprouts w/ Pork Belly. I am a lover of brussel sprouts and pork belly and despite that this dish was a miss for me. Audrey ordered the Skate Wing with a Salsify and Raisin Caper Sauce, which was beautifully prepared. The fish was delicious and the sauce was amazing! I was torn between the Flatiron Steak and the Wild Boar Chop. I asked our server if the Wild Board was fatty. She said it was served on the bone and the meat was very lean. So I went with the Boar. I know Boar is supposed to be lean, but this piece was anything but. I had to maneuver around the fat and several times had to discreetly spit pieces back to my plate from my mouth. After several bites, I decided to ask for another dish. The server swept away the Boar and put the order in for the Flat Iron Steak. At this point the chef came out and starred at our table with a not so pleasant look on his face. The Flat Iron Steak was delivered cook perfectly at Medium Rare. Again the chef came out of the kitchen to and set his eyes directly on our table. We found this to be very uncomfortable. If he had issue with my opinion on the Boar Chop I would have been more than happy to discuss it with him. The stare down tactics I felt were a little over the top and old school for a new school restaurant. Either which way the Flat Iron Steak was good. Audrey and I both had a cough and opted for hot tea and water over wine. Our server knew that we were under the weather, but still tried to sell us on cocktails or wine. She said you can order a bottle and then take what you don drink home. Hmmmmmm.... Cough Cough Cough....The interior was beautiful. The design team did a great job on capturing the original feel of the space and while still making it modern and new. We sat at the lounge which wasn ideal, but without reservations what can you do. Sepia also has one or two large communal tables. The hostess said the communal seating is Just like Avec. Unfortunately, the communal seating was the only thing like Avec. The service was a bit on the slow side and pushed the alcohol thing way too hard. Maybe that can be attributed to being sat in the lounge. Who knows!After it was all said in done I felt Sepia was a disappointment. I really wanted to love it because it two blocks from my house. Oh well, Avec is only one block away.1 Flatbread1 Brussel Sprout1 Skate Wing1 Wild Boar Chop/ Flat Iron Steak------------------------------------------------------$90', I live in the West Loop and have eaten at Sepia twice. I LOVE this restaurant! Once I dined in the lounge - nice but seating is a tad uncomfortable. Your best bet is to dine in the dining room - it has great decor (chandeleirs are gorgeous!). I have tried all of the flatbreads and they all make delicious starters. I have ordered the Flat Iron Steak twice because it is THAT good. Comes in a hot cast iron dish with mushrooms and potatoes on the side. I do not reccomend the potatoes in duck fat (basically really greasy chips). And finally, I highly recommend the Apple Dumpling as a dessert - again, I've had it twice (oops!).Their Argentenian Malbecs are also very good., 'Setting: I enjoy the space. The lighting, table settings and color palette do a great job at setting a classic dining experience. While not the best spot for large groups, parties up to about 5 would have a fine time.Food: I felt that the food was at the cusp of being recommendable. Nothing was bad, but I don know if I will remember any of it. We started with the pork roulette and the apple bacon flat-bread. The flat bread was def. the best part of the meal. For the main course, I had the sirloin steak, which had a nice flavor, but was served in a cast iron dish that made it somewhat difficult to deal with. My company ordered the steak tartar served with raw quail egg. The tartar was nice and flavorful, but was missing that wow factor (other than wow, I eating raw beef).Service/Overall: I thought the service was a bit inattentive. We were one of three tables there for lunch and I thought that the service could have been a bit more consistent. Furthermore, he suggested everything on the menu, and did so by purely re-stating what the menu said; I could have done that. If youe in the area, and have the ability, step around the corner and dine at Blackbird.', 'I had my bday dinner here, and it was lovely. Delicious meal under those beautiful chandeliers. A bit noisy even on a Tuesday, but a nice meal overall. I will return, for lunch maybe.', I have been to Sepia twice and enjoyed it both times. The first time I went here with my friend and we had a great dinner for two - indulging in lots of appetizers, specials, bottles of wine and glasses of champagne. Needless to say, we had a big tab. But we had an amazing experience. The food was great. I remember that my friend ordered an Elk chop which was something I had not seen on the menu before. Normally I wouldn't order flat breads but they are really good here and I definitely suggest you try one.More recently I went with a group of 5 for my birthday. Again, we had a wonderful experience. The service was much better this second time and our waitress helped us all pick out wonderful things to eat. We had to order a flat bread again and it was amazing. This time we tried the fries (potatoes cooked in pork fat) too. We all got something different at the table and the reports of chicken, fish and pork chops were all positive. The grilled octopus was good and tasted how grilled octopus should - but was nothing spectacular. I had the cheese plate before my dessert and I had the waitress select three cheese for me. They were really unique and it was a fun course to add for my birthday dinner., best porkchop i have had in a coon's age., Went on a Tuesday night, there was only a 9:15 reservation available. We showed up to see several empty tables, and were seated at a 4 top (there were 2 of us). We sat for about 15-20 minutes with no one coming to the table at all. A server finally came over saying that there was a mixup, she was sorry, yada yada. Bad start.Now the food - crab flatbread drenched in oil with very little crab on it, pork rillet was bland. The octopus was very good however.Both entrees were a major disappointment - the skate (oily mess) and the shortibs (underseasoned and flavorless).Now I'm being picky - but the cheese menu doesn't list milk type or age - really annoying. Overall, I wouldn't go back., 'What all the hype?Well, for starters, this place excels in many areas. - Decor - very hip and chic with great natural textures such as the wood and exposed bricks. Loved the table tops Faux leather- Food - everything was great. The octopus was out of this world, the sweetbreads were my first that were not breaded and they melted in your mouth. The crepes at dessert were so delicious. For entrees, the cod was so rich, yet not over the top. - Wine - great approachable list with very few bottles over $100, which is refreshing. We had a great white Rhone and the Hyde Vineyard Pinot. Both were outstanding and less then $75.00 each.- Service - was unobtrusive, continual and without effort. Our server Sharan was very knowledgeable, polite and skilled at her craft.Overall all, a very good dining experience'|1
45|sixteen-chicago|'Give it some time. Yes, thats my sage advice to you. Sixteen, in the Trump Tower, has only been open a week, and it was obvious on my visit there last night that they are still working out the bugs.First the positives- the views from the Tower Room (the main dining room) are spectacular. Since the restaurant is the on 16th floor, the floor to ceiling windows give you a view of the Wrigley and Tribune Towers like I have never seen before. You are almost at an equal level to the clock face- absolutely stunning lit up at night!! The other room(the River Room) has a view of the river out to the Lake. There is an outside patio (cannot open until the construction is done in 2009) that has the best views in the city and will be a great place to grab a drink during the Summer months once open.The chandelier is magnificent- Swarovski crystals glittering in the light. The chairs and table linens are cream colored and stand out beautifully against the copper colored walls. The bar area is a bit smallish (reminded me a bit of NoMi) with about 10 chairs at the light colored bar and a smattering of small tables and banquettes. On to the food. You can order off a full tasting menu ($88 - $130 pp- the 2nd being the chef blind tasting menu) but the whole table has to do that so we chose to order off the menu. They start you out with an amuse bouche. Last night it was an oyster in a creme lemon sauce. We ordered a couple of appetizers, the scallops and the quail. While the tiny scallops were good and covered in a sauce, the quail was a bit overwhelmed by the beet sauce that came with it.As for the entrees- I chose the monk fish served with mushrooms and artichokes (very good) and my friend chose the lobster pocket (also good). The food is beautifully presented (you know what I am talking about; the drizzles of sauce on the plate, the artfully placed food, the fanning out of the vegetables, the tiny portions) Lovely to look at- almost too pretty to eat!We were then offered another tasting, this time of a cherry chocolate cake morsel before our desserts of apple cake and the strawberry plate. While the apple cake was just okay- there was so much going on with the Study of Strawberry I must comment. There was a strawberry mousse, a beignet, an ice, and a sorbet all artfully arranged tied together with a vanilla bean. Interesting.So what prompted the lower rating? The service. It is clear that they are still learning the ropes. When I called for a reservation- I was told they were booked. When I pushed to get on the waiting list- she took all my info and then said surprised, Oh. That went through. You have a reservation.We arrived a half an hour early for our reservation and checked in with the hostess. When she didn come to get us for an hour we went back to the hostess stand. She said Oops, I forgot about you. Not exactly what I would expect from a place of this caliber. She then went to see about our table- yet I could see from where I stood that there were empty tables in the room Our server for dinner, while knowledgeable about the menu, wasn warm and welcoming, and seemed to disappear for long periods of time. We saw the bread guy more than him. It took forever to get a drink and we had to ask for the menus. And the timing was off as to when things came out- like no one asked if we wanted coffee with dessert and then when it did come- we were done with dessert. I expect more from a place like this.But there were some high points. When you pull up to the front- like any luxury hotel, the doorman (Tim) greeted me, introduced himself and asked my name. He got one of the valets to take my car and told me to find him when I left. He then promptly walked me into the building and handed me over to the next person who personally escorted me to the elevator. If you ask where anything is- you are personally escorted there, not pointed in the general direction. Everyone says,  Welcome to the Trump Tower. On my way out- the doorman was there, called me by name and promptly got someone to get my car. Gotta love that level of service! So give it a few weeks. Let them work out the service bugs and then stop by to enjoy an upscale evening out. With our bill coming to about $250 for two people without tip, it would be a great place for a dinner with someone special. The Trump hospitality is working to shine through and I am confident it will by the time I give it another try.', So I'm glad to see that I wasn't the only one impressed with Sixteen even though I haven't dined there yet. It's all about the view! Truly impressive! It feels as though you could reach out and touch the clock on the Wrigley Tower! I would argue that this view is just as awesome, if not possibly cooler, than the view from the lounge in the Hancock. Yeah, you can't see for miles and miles, but I think the view from Sixteen is much more Representative of the city. The view has personality, unlike the cold and removed feeling you get from 96th floor. (I'm not at all saying I don't love the Hancock, but it's just different.) Sixteen is definitely a place I'll be taking people from out of town, even if it's just for a drink in the comfy, swanky bar. In addition to the view, the drinks are fantastic! Or at least the one I had was. I can't remember specifically all the ingredients, it was some kind of martini with orange blossom water, a cinnamon coated rim and marinated cherries. It was absolutely fantastic!!, 'Ie been there twice already. I wanted to write a review after my dinner there on Valentine day but decided to go again on an average day and then forge my opinion. Having been in the restaurant business for a few years I can say that a restaurant doesn really come to its own until about a year after being opened so I just going to state the major pros and cons.Pros: I would have to say that even before the views my favorite thing about this place is the service. I was blown away both times with the attention, friendliness and elegance of the service. From the person taking the reservation over the phone to the hostess, the bartenders, the wait staff, even the busboys were all extremely friendly and very well trained. Our server Richard (I believe that was his name) was impeccable in his job, recommending wines and food. Second, the views are spectacular doesn matter where you look. The front seat at one of chicago finest towers, the Tribune Tower is simply breath taking. I will predict that once the terrace opens in 2009 that will be in many tourist Must do while in Chicago lists.Price is high but expected, so no complains there. The food is very experimental (scallops with peanut butter and ketchup?, not for everyone, although I liked it). They stride to be different, and different they are. Even though the portions are small I left very satisfied. We were with a 7 year old kid and they even made macaroni and cheese for her which she loved (and us too).My main complain comes in the little details. I was there with someone that was celebrating their 60th birthday, but besides a happy birthday from the hostess (we made clear it was her 60th birthday on the reservation) nothing was done, even though she also ordered a dessert. No candle, no happy birthday, nothing. She even mentioned that she wished she had a candle since it was such a big day for her.Another complain is the billing. Apparently when you place the order they charge you 30% of the bill right away to secure funds before the meal is delivered and then charge you the total cost. So they charged us $370 for our meal (3 adults and 1 kid), plus $170 extra (two charges). When we called to complain the manager said that that was their policy so expect it to be credited back soon. It been a week and a half already and no credit has been made.So in general I giving the restaurant 4 stars because I know they still have to work out the kinks, but I believe this will eventually become one of the hot spots for high class Chicago. I will go back.', so i went to this space last weekend, and my review is mixed. the atmosphere is wonderful, definately with great modern style. the experience from start to finish, was just average. we did the 6 course tasting and the food, although well prepared, wasn't as inventive or dynamic as one would expect from a top notch restaurant. the wine parings were the most dissapointing aspect.... 3 of 6 which you can get at trader joes...wll under par if you ask me considering all the possible options that exist. although overall nice, not memorable or a place that can hold to the other big hitters in the city. potential is there, just needs to work on some things.note: been back since my inital review... soooo different. they are amazing... bit pricey, but that is what money is for i feel. service, food, wine selection ( prefer a larger variety but what they have is good) and best off.... hospitality. one of my fav's now.. and for all the good reasons... try it.. not an every day place, but still worth it all!, 'Went for lunch . I admit I am a foodie. I was pretty disappointed overall. Decor: First there is a difference between sparse and looking like you couldn afford to finish the place. Sixteen looks like the later. Service: POOR took over 1 1/2 hours for lunch they took our credit card and we waited over 20 mintues to bring it and the final bill back... MMMM wonder where the card was all that time. Food: SPARSE again there is a difference between supersize and getting one money worth. We left hungry. Maybe this place dazzles at night but there are to many places that dazzle during the day as well as at night, don leave you hungry and offer better service. Donald we expected SO much more from you. Sorry YOUR FIRED.....', One of the best meals I've had, and it was only lunch. The lemongrass soup is just the right blend of creamy and spicy. All the dishes are an experience for all your senses. And you just can't beat the view. It truly is unlike any other in the city and the Wrigley Building does feel as if it is at your fingertips. The hotel itself is just gorgeous, particularly the guest rooms! This is a great restaurant for a business lunch, date or special occasion. I highly recommend it, Fantastic view of the city. Great high ceilings. Very attentive service. Excellent food.DId the 6-course menu w/ wine pairing. Enjoyed the crab salad the best, was pleasantly surprised by the scallops, and (while it was good) wasn't so fond of the duck. The sommelier was extremely nice and talked to us about Washington vineyards . She even did some Internet research and provided us with a map of her recommended destinations. That's great service!Sixteen is a must., 'The overall experience is 4 stars, but food is a 3, so how about a 3.25? Definitely come here at night to get the AMAZING view of the city - nothing like dining over the Wrigley building. It was a little confusing getting up to Sixteen, but everyone was friendly and directed us to the elevators where we went to the 16th floor. We were then greeted with two walls of wine - YUMMY! I want that! One side was red, one white (can remember which side was which). I was impressed with their wine list... both superficially and quality-wise. It came in a cute wooden box (i a sucker for stupid things), and featured mostly west coast (OR, WA, and of course CA wines), but also had Italian & French wines. They also feature specialty cocktails, but our table opted for wines on a Thurs night - We had the Long Vineyards Cab and a Signorello red. Both were delicious, and Signorello was just as yummy as I remember it being. I never heard of Long Vineyards before and don think they sell @ Sam or Binny, but I could be wrong.Moving onto the food.. we started out with the cheese plate & flatbreads. I was a fan of the multi-grain flatbread- it was spicy (had a kick to it), and I not a huge fan of cheese, but I did enjoy it. Nothing was TOO stinky or extreme. For apps, I had the crab salad, which was pretty, but was just ok in flavor. I then had the duck for my entree, which was just ok as well. The scallops (which I mooched off of someone else) was succulent and tasty, but not spectacular. (To-date, the best scallops Ie had in the city were at NoMi - the diver scallop tart). The dessert was suprisingly, the best part of the meal (aside from the wine, obvi). I had the hazelnut cake / granny smith apple tart, others had the strawberry lovers (forgot the name) - which featured a juicy strawberry, strawberry cake, strawberry pudding of some sort, and strawberry sorbet - it was DELICIOUS!! The lemon dessert was also really good.. They make really good tart dessert dishes.I would be back here for a romantic date, or a business dinner.', 'We visited Sixteen for an anniversary celebration on April 6th. We made reservations via open table, and there were openings for the Sunday sitting until 2pm. We ended up taking a 1:30 seating and arrived about 1pm. They were able to seat us when we arrived.The attentiveness of the staff at the table and in the restaurant in general was a disappointment. We were seated at our table on the glass, and a server brought a complimentary glass of champagne. But, besides that, there were no other servers who stopped by our table or who we were able to flag down for about 15 minutes. The other 3 tables around us seemed to be taking advantage of the great Sunday Brunch option, but we did not know if we were to help our selves, or if there was even a menu option for other dining options at that time.After that 15 minutes, I got up and found someone at the bar who came back to our table to explain that we were to start the buffet whenever we wanted. (It would have been nice if the hostess who sat us explained that fact). The buffet was nice. They had an omelet station (with shrimp option) a fruit station, breakfast station with DELICIOUS blueberry pancakes. I only recommend taking these however, if you like your pancakes a little uncooked in the center, as I do. I took a couple servings of these, and each time they were a little raw in the center.They had gigantic shrimp, nice pieces of crab legs, a sushi station.The space is nice. Not what I would have expected in a Trump building. It was tastefully done and as mentioned before, the views are unparalleled in a 4-star type dining establishment in the city.The lack of attention picked up, as each time we went back to the buffet, our old plate was cleared and new silverware replaced. I was disappointed however, that with the number of wait staff standing around, that it was not their policy to rearrange the table linens (refold the cloth napkin) when we got up. But then, the on-again- off-again service seemed to disappear. I was glad that we did not select the 2pm reservation for brunch, because at 2:01pm, they started cleaning up each of the buffet stations. It was rather distracting, since our table was right near the stations, to have them cleaning up the stations while we were still eating. There was even a server who moved our table while we were sitting at it so that he could take the extension cord that was feeding power to one of the buffet stations (tacky).Luckily, we finished with the buffet stations around 2pm, so we were not affected by their clean up ritual. But with all the surrounding tables around us empty, we sat for a good 15- 20 minutes with no one checking on us. Our soiled plates were in front of us. We finally had to get up and ask someone to please bring us the check.When the check did arrive. . . now, mind you, we had never seen a menu, did not know what was and what was not included in the buffet. My wife and I were taking bets as to how much the buffet was. I thought $50 each, she thought $40. We were both low, it was just under $75 per person for the Sunday Brunch buffet.So, yes, it is worth the experience to eat in a building that is still under construction, and that does not have a roof on it yet, since they are still building floors above. It was worth the attentive staff from the minute you pull up under the construction barricades and enter the building. It was not worth the door man, looking us up and down as to what we were wearing (nice up-dressed jeans outfit). The views were amazing, the food was ok, the service was hit-or-miss, and not what I would have expected at this 5-star want to be restaurant.It is much better than the other sky-view restaurants, like the one at Lake-Point towers, the Everest Room, the John Hancock 95th, as far as decor. But those restaurants are 1/2 the price of this Trump spectacle.Just know what you are getting yourselves in for, and come with a polite wave practiced so that you can get the attention of your waitstaff !', I took the advice of another yelper and tried this out over brunch/lunch before taking the chokingly expensive plunge for dinner.The service here is impeccable, as expected. The wine list comes in a wooden box, which I thought was funny, although awkward to handle. And the view is the most unique in the city. It is truly worth the visit just to have the bird's eye view of the Tribune building and south Wacker Drive. There is a large balcony, but it won't be open until 2009 due to construction on going at the top of the building. When it opens, it will be quite a swanky place to grab a drink (I don't think dining would be fun due to the wind).The food was very well prepared. My chicken was moist and well seasoned. Consistent with many other reviews, for the price, I expected more, but it is still good solid food. It is a hotel restaurant, so it will be overpriced.The bar is small and doesn't seem capable of handling much of an overflow. Rebar on the lobby level wasn't open yet, but should be opening this month. Based on what I could see, I don't think this will be giving any nearby lounges much competition. The balcony opens to the hotel lobby below, so I doubt they will be cranking the music too loud. Probably a good place to take your parents., '5 Stars for the service and the ambiance, 3 stars for the food. I made my reservation on Open Table, they only had a 5:30PM reservation available so I took it. What I really wanted was 6:30p so I phoned the restaurant immediately after making my reservation and asked if I could move my reservation. The hostess said that there was not a 6:30pm available but she could accommodate us at 6:00 pm so I agreed. On the DAY of the reservation they called to confirm my reservation but it was still at 5:30! I explained to the woman exactly what went down but she failed to believe me. I explained that I could not come in at 5:30 pm and asked to speak with a manager. The manager phoned me back and informed me that 6PM was not available but that a 6:30 pm had just canceled and they could accommodate me at that time. Well, I have worked in restaurants since I was 15 years old - from a Rib joint to Charlie Trotters and I can say with 90% confidence that you would rather seat someone at 6pm vs. 6:30 pm (so you can turn the table faster for a later seating) and if you have a table at 6:30, you have a table at 6pm. So, I was slightly irritated with the run around but happy that the manager had been so overly polite about the whole thing in the end.When I walked into the hotel there was commotion over some sort of event so we had trouble getting to where we were going but once we got there, I was blown away. I am a slave to aesthetics and this place is my master. Classic, contemporary elegance - and charm! Just when you walk off the elevator you are blown away by the glass encased wine cellar. When our hostess walked us into the dining room, I nearly fell to my knees in tears - the soaring ceiling, the chandelier and the 2 stories of windows! The view of the clock tower at the Wrigley building and the top of the Tribune building were amazing - as if youe floating in the sky. My only request is that someone should implode the 440 N. Wabash building WHAT AN EYE SOAR! And, to the giant slob that lives on the 18the floor facing south at 440 N. Wabash, whose apartment is reminiscent of a storage unit - DUDE CLEAN YOUR APARTMENT, you nearly ruined my experience with your filth. Our server was awesome. I would say the server and the back waiter were a 10, not ONE single complaint. They didn up sell us on wine. They made adequate recommendations and they were incredibly professional. We sat for 4 hours and not once did we feel any pressure to get up - that is truly professional. I can say more because they were a 10. We started with 2 appetizers, we shared the grilled shrimp with olive oil ice cream and the crab salad. The crab salad was far better than the grilled shrimp. I liked the olive oil ice cream but my friend was not entirely thrilled with ice cream being accompanied with shrimp. Next, I had the duck with polenta which was very good but not great. My friend had the seared halibut, nobody liked the seared halibut. I had a taste of her fish and it was too chewy and raw in the center. In my opinion, fish should either be cooked OR it should be sushi. We shared the cheese plate in place of dessert. I would go back for dinner another time to give it another shot. But for this price range, you absolutely CANNOT beat the ambiance at Sixteen, no way, especially not when that terrace opens. But, in this price range, if youe looking for haute cuisine, there are a number of restaurants in Chicago that are far superior in the food department.', Sixteen has one of the best view's in the city. You are right next to the top of the Wrigley Building and all it's fabulous architecture.We did the 10-course blind tasting (with drinks) and it was $180! But we decided to do the major-splurge and taste everything the chef had to provide. A few of the courses we the same that were listed on the 6-course tasting so we were a bit disappointed that the blind tasting wasn't complete unique. One of the wines we LOVED on its own but felt that it really did not go with the food at all. In general the food was good but we were only blown away by about three of the ten courses. That being said - it was still good and everything served to the tables around us off of the regular menu looked good as well.The wait staff is excellent and made sure we were well attended to. They said they were going to email us a list of the food and wines we had with the dinner (since they were not listed at they are with the 6-course menu) but I have not received it yet.I would definitely consider this for a romantic or special date and even when taking people to dinner when coming from out of town. The hostess told me that in 2009 they are planning on opening the outside patio as a bar and serving tapas. I'll definitely go back to check that out., First we had drinks on the 16th floor and the view was amazing, I can't wait until the patio opens up. The bartender made an excellent Gimlet, I was confused as to why it was garnished with a gross maraschino cherry. The food was great. It was a Tuesday night and there weren't a ton of people in there. The waitress was very slow with everything. I loved the fact that the manager, or sommelier decanted our wine. I hope they fix the slow wait staff., I wouldn't go so far as to fire Trump for creating this restaurant because the views are amazing, the staff is very attentive (almost to the point of annoying, but not quite) and the ambience is consistent with what you'd find in a higher end hotel.Maybe I just made the wrong food choice? Since we were there for lunch, I had the soft-shell crab sandwich. The bread was soaked in butter, the crab was over cooked and it fell apart before I was even halfway through!! One of my co-workers ordered the same thing and she was just as disgusted as I was. Another girl with us ordered the pulled pork sandwich and they put on more cheese than pork... not what I would have expected at all.The bill? $247 - 4 Sandwiches and 1 Bottle of Veuve, Come for the view, but don't stay and eat. At least not for lunch. Terribly disappointing.Best thing on the table? The pretzel bread in the bread basket. I'm serious.For lunch I had the salmon. I ate about 1/3 of it and picked at the rest because I don't think it was cooked thoroughly. It was definitely a bit too pink and raw looking for my taste. Other diners at my table had the lobster salad sandwich. They raved about the fries, but not so much the sandwich. I've heard dinner is better here so maybe it's worth coming back for that - but not if I have to pay for myself. I'd recommend just coming up for some cocktails., If the Donald told me that brunch at Sixteen is the most luxurious brunch experience I'll ever have, he wouldn't be lying. I took the parents there for Mother's Day and the setting was spectacular (even without the terrace open). The wait staff was very attentive. The restaurant had separate stations for omelettes, sushi and steak and lamb chops. They also had various fresh seafood and a big dessert table among other more typical brunch foods. Everything was superb and delicious but for $115 a person I guess I expected something even more superb and delicious. But I think it's usually $65 for non-mother's day and that would've gotten it an extra star., Yeah babes. This is great. Or maybe I was just having a great day. Straight from a grand tasting at the Ritz, 3 of us headed over here around happy hour time. It was happy! All of us had really wonderful drinks (although, I don't remember what I had, just that it had champagne in it), and the place was airy with great music that set a nice mood. Then off to dinner elsewhere...I will be back for dinner, and I will be back for the patio., I went to Sixteen this week on a work dinner. We made reservations about 2 months in advance, so the buildup was big. I was not disappointed. The restaurant is as goche as you'd expect considering, but the views are amazing and the food was really terrific. The menu changes daily, so you never know what you're going to get. We got a few appetizers- a beef tortellini and a quail dish. Both were great. I had the halibut, which was good- but when I tried the lamb, I regretted my decision a bit. We had three amazing desserts- a hazelnut dish, a chocolate dish, and a coffee dish. I think dessert was my favorite. The waiter was very well versed in the wines, and recommended a very tasty pinot noir- so tasty we had two bottles!I went for 4 stars because I just felt this place was so over the top expensive. I'm glad I got to check it out, but now that I've experienced it, I don't think I'll go back., eh, i didn't think anything was extraordinary - besides the price. Six people, apps, desserts & drinks (no entres) and bill over $600. Nothing was memorable - expect the view. Service efficient, prompt, but bland, food was decent - don't even remember what I ordered (if that tells you anything), amuse bouches were a nice touch. Wonb't be rushing back., After such an impressive time in Rebar. My girlfriend and I and couple of friends went upstairs to Sixteen. We had high expections because we had such an amazing time in Rebar and wanted to see what the restauarant had to offer. If it was anything like the experience in the lounge, than I would be ok. Not exactly. First, the views are amazing, everything else was just ok. We sat at the bar and had a few cocktails, bartenders were friendly but not over the top and didn't seem to have much of a personality. We didn't get a chance to eat, but from our experience in the bar, i won't be hurrying back for this place. If anything, check out Rebar., 'There was outstanding and mediocre... After being in the hospitality business in sales for over 10 years, I just expected the full monty from the hype. There was not anything really personable about the initial contact at this restaurant. The hostess just seated us - not a thank you for joining us or how is your evening going, welcome to Sixteen, etc... Nothing. We were seated in the far right dining area which had the best view in the house (which we would later confirm by having the fireworks display as we were having dessert - amazing). It took 12 minutes for our main server to come to our table and another 15 minutes before we actually got our first cocktail (and they are not inexpensive). I did try a little test to make sure I wasn just imagining things. I asked for extra blue cheese olives - which came 20 minutes later after asking for them again. Our server was VERY nervous. It did not appear she was knowledgable of the menu items and did not come prepared with any kind of story or introduction of the menu. When we did finally order, she mentioned three times how we needed to order dessert with our dinner order because they all take 20 minutes to make. We enjoyed our food - over the top was used while we tasted the tempura appetizer and the corn tortilla soup. I had the filet - cooked perfectly and was tender. My husband and his friend had the duck and the polenta was to die for. Our friend wife had the fish and she was really excited. The gentleman who assisted the main server, Tim, actually blew her away. He should have her position, no question. He served us our apps and main dishes and he was VERY confident when describing EACH dish while he placed it in front of us. He answered all of our questions - when he didn know the answer, he actually went into the kitchen to ask. The sommolier was really nice and helped us with the wine - which was and excellent Pinot Noir and was not too expensive. He was very approachable...Dessert was very delicious - carmalized banana and then also we had the apple crisp - both worthwhile!!Anyways, worth it - yes, the food was excellent - won be back for a while. Service needs to go up a notch with a $500 bill for four people.Work on the service, Donald - it needs to have some personality and confidence.', This place is extraordinary. The decor is in tip top shape, newly constructed with fantastic view of Wrigley Bulding, CNBC bulding, the lake, and the river. Comfortable chair, huge tables, fresh flow, candles, perfect lighting,... flawless. We had the price fix menu, I think about 6-7 course for $95 with wine pairing at $48 extra. Each wine tasting pours were about a glass full! So tip to all of you, get 2 price fix menu's with 1 wine pairing and share! The food came out fast, in order, and with little wait, except for desert, which took a bit longer.The waitress strived to please, but I sense she was a bit overwhelmed, she had about 6 tables. Thats too many for a high end restaurant, which begins to suffer on service and attention. She let us taste 3 different wines before deciding on what to order by the glass.Dinner for two comes out to be close to $380 with tip and tax. But thats normal in comparison to Tru, Alinea, etc...Most of the tables have fantastic views. The restaurant was designed so almost every table were only a few feet away from the window. Go for the food, go for the service, go for the view. Its worth it. Especially on Saturday night when fireworks are lite at Navy Pier., 'Caveat: came here on a business partner dime, so we were free to eat and drink whatever we pleased. Hence my review would be 3-stars if I had to pay for it myself.The entire staff, from the coat check to the servers to the waiter were very friendly and helpful. The sommelier was very friendly as well, not pretentious, and he said that he had just started the job recently. He definitely knew his stuff and was awesome.Getting to the right entrance was a bit of a maze, but once you step inside the first floor lobby, away from the construction scaffolding, you are welcomed with vanilla-scented candles and pure luxury. Even the elevators were top notch. You get to the restaurant and are greeted with a swank bar and an amazing display of their wines from floor to high ceilings. We sat in the area past the wine collection, near a balcony that had a spectacular view of the clock of the Wrigley Building. The staff told us that theyl be opening up the balcony next spring, so there should be some amazing parties there! The ceilings were insanely high, with a giant chandelier and decorative mirror. Very classy!I had a gimlet straight up, followed by several white and red wines (don remember any of them). All of the wines were recommended by the sommelier and all great choices.Below is a review of the food, which the waiter wanted us to order our entire meal (apps, entrees, desserts) at the beginning:We ordered a sampling of the beef tortellini and crab salad appetizers. The beef tortellini was good and we got 4 of them for around $15. They were pretty big, like shumai. The crab salad was placed in a cup made of thin cantaloupe slices, about an inch in diameter. (I getting nerdy, yes.) It was pretty good, but I was disappointed that the crab salad was about the same price as the beef tortellini and the portion was minuscule. As for the entrees, the waiter highly recommended the duck, and I went with it because 1) I had read good reviews on Yelp and 2) it was one of the cheaper entrees on the menu (high $30s), so if he was recommending it, he was being truly honest, not financially biased in order to get a larger tip. (Again, too much nerdy overthinking.) The duck was delicious and although I first thought it was a tiny portion when I got it (ala the Citibank commercial) it was really rich and filling. The skin was crispy, the fat was chewy, and the meat was tender. Absolutely delicious. And the polenta? I would love to build a house out of it and eat my way out. SOOO good!Dessert was good as well. I forgot what I got, but involved a too-strong tequila ice cream and a delicious caramelized banana. I tried some of the other desserts and they were pretty good. They also gave our table a delicious pineapple dessert shooter and two trays of random tiny desserts. Honestly, I don think I come back for an entire meal on my own dime, but if I had the money, I still skip the appetizers and load up on the entrees and desserts. I had a great experience and would love to be taken back... any sugar mamas out there? =)', Sixteen is a beautiful space, the colors, the view, the huge chandelier are all something to see. When I walked in, and saw the gorgeous restaurant, I was really looking forward to a knock-your-socks-off meal.I went on a Tuesday night with a group of work folks. Luckily the company was getting the tab, because its definitely not cheap.I ordered the tortilla soup with suckling pig to start. The soup had a great taste and the pork was tender, but it was barely warm. I ordered the duck because of all the buzz around 'the best new dish in Chicago'. The presentation was great, the polenta was wonderful, but the duck was tough and bland.All of the party was pretty unimpressed with what they ordered... a few of the guys even went home hungry.Our waiter was attentive and unpretentious, but the pace of the meal was entirely too slow.All in all, it really wasn't worth the money. A great place to have a drink with an out of town guest, but I'd skip it for dinner., 'We had a great table with a great view. The service was a little slow, but the waitress was very sweet.The surf/turf appetizer was very good. The beef was very flavorful and tender. The crab salad was beautiful, but flavor didn match the appearance. The white creamy dressing over powered the crab. The scallops in my entree were done nicely with the naturally sweet flavor. The duck was chewy and tough with liver like taste to it. We had to send it back. The wait staffs were super nice about it and suggested we got something else. So we got the lamb instead. Tasted so much better and tender. A little too fatty but delicious. We got chestnut apple cake and baba rum for desserts. They were both good but not memorable.The cocktails we got were all very good and beautiful. I had a gossip. It came with an orchid in it. We had 5 cocktails between 2 of us because they were all very good. But little deliciousness came with $14 each price tag. And our dinner for 2 including drinks and tips were $300. Was it worth it? Il come back for the view and the drinks.', chilled lobster salad is out of this world!!Dining high in the sky with the birds - yes please!Amazing views, lovely service and delicious menu choices. My only critique is that the steak tasted good, but didn't look very good. Minor issue.Absolutely romantic and wonderful. Come for lunch if you want to be nice to your pocket book., Sixteen is definitely a special place to behold. The attention to detail of the decor, from the main lobby, to the elevator, to the bar and restaurant is truly magnificent. The main dining room is smaller than you might expect, but with 30' cathedral ceilings seems very spacious, not to mention the wall of windows overlooking the Chicago River. White linens and dark Brazilian hardwood adorn a very sophisticated dining room topped off with a massive chandelier. The decor, service and view are all quite special. In particular I found the sommelier to be quite helpful, which is nice when the wine list contains over 900 bottles. Everything was on point and worthy of the cost ($300 for two including wine is probably on the low end of what you can expect) except for the food. For me the food was just OK. Sure it was good, the presentation was nice but for that price I don't expect to be able to pick out specific problems with the dishes, especially since I am not a chef nor a food critic. My appetizer had one flavor (which I was unable to pinpoint) that was overpowering the others and my entre was although cooked perfectly, somewhat bland.It was disappointing really that a place so close to perfection would fall flat on the most important aspect of all, the food. My advice is enjoy everything short of the cuisine by heading to the adjacent bar., 'This restaurant is so beautiful that I really want to give it a rave review and tell everyone I know to go and experience it, but something is holding me back from doing so. As far as fine dining goes, it is not on the top of my list of places that I love; I think I fell prey to high expectations. We started off our experience with some cocktails at the restaurant bar. I ordered the FieldsFizz which consisted of Champaign, Absolut Mandarin and, I believe, a little orange juice. It was very refreshing and not too sweet.My favorite part of the meal was probably the amuse bouche of asparagus vichyssoise with trout belly served in an expresso cup, it was a nice start to the meal. I could not pass up the foie gras when I saw it on the appetizer menu, and I do not regret eating every bite of it. There was a nice play of savory and sweet in the dish; it was satisfying. My entree of diver scallops would have been perfect if they were not luke-warm. I liked that there were several components on the dish that I could stack onto my fork for well-rounded bites. The only item of the dish that I was not sure about were the potatoes, which looked like pizza pockets and tasted like potato chips. A close second behind the amuse bouche on the list of my dining experience highlights was the cheese selection; there was a nice variety (six or seven) and they were all good. The portion of the meal most lacking was definitely the dessert; I think I liked the palate cleanser of mango topped with chocolate mousse better than any of the desserts that followed it.The service was friendly, efficient, and very knowledgeable about the wine selection, which is always helpful when you have a binder of choices.I would say that this is worth visiting for the view and a good meal, it just does not hit the great mark. Also, be prepared to lay down a material amount of money because the price tag is not cheap, but I would not expect any less from the Donald.', 'Not even with 16 birthday wishes could this place hold up to all its hype.When I called to make a reservation the reservationist was very accommodating very pleasant and made me excited to dine here for my man birthday.When we came in the views are indeed amazing. We were seated directly in the windows and it set the tone. The service was very accommodating and professional. There were however, unforgiveable details I have three major complaints: The wine director, the manager on duty, and the dangerous piece of glass/crab shell that my boyfriend found in his first course. We opted for the chefs tasting and I had inquired to do the wine parings. I was pushed so hard in the wine paring direction by both the wine director and our server that they almost moved my seat. When the wine director was describing the pairings they just seemed a little funny and uninspired. Also, not all six courses come with a paring and I was a little turned off by that. I taking the sommelier exam next month so I particular about wine. I oped for two bottles instead, one white and one red. I told the wine director my plan and he replied, fine. I know, scary right? When he opened the bottle it was one of the worst displays of wine service that I have ever seen. The label was backwards when presented to me, the bottle was opened away from our table and the director let the cork give a huge pop! when he opened the bottle. He then slammed the bottle down. He was obviously pissed that I didn do the parings. This was beyond inappropriate. I told the wine director at my restaurant and he was so appalled that he couldn stop letting out huge exaggerated gasps.So, when we got our first course it was not good. A crab salad surrounded by summer cantaloupe with micro-greens in a pineapple vinaigrette. The melon overpowered the whole dish and there was a micro green in the mix that tasted really strong and bitter, almost like rotting. My boyfriend had these black balls in his salad that were hard and almost the texture of a snail shell. There were none in my salad so I know it was something that was not meant for the salad. Also he then felt something sharp and hard in his mouth as it nicked his tongue, he spit it out, it looked like a chard from a broken plate. I picked it up and it was so sharp that it could have easily pierced my finger. We let the back waiter know.A few minutes later, a very nervous Asian woman approached our table and this is what she said word for work,  Hi, (nervously grinning) I understand that you THINK that there was glass in your food, just so you know, it was the shell of the crab. Well, anyways...have a good night! It was weird and disheartening. As a member of the management team at my restaurant, this really urked me. She never introduced herself or said that she was sorry....and not like it was necessary but our bill was not adjusted in any way and no deserts or anything has been done to express that they had done anything wrong. There was no fault admitted at all, and this is what bothered me most. Had he swallowed that he would have internal injuries!! I just don even know how to react to that. For other situations like this in the future, because they will happen, I fear for their guests.I didn want to make a huge deal about it to ruin our night anymore than it had already been terribly destroyed so I oped to write the general manager the next day. She finally called me two days later to follow up and seemed very board by my issue. She kept saying over and over again , I sorry you didn enjoy your evening with us. Her grand gesture was offering me to come in again and have the tasting menu and she would send out a complimentary extra course. WTF?!? As if I would ever return to a death trap restaurant such as sucksteen. I livid.I don care who you are or where you came from...this is totally wrong on so many levels. Had this happened to one of my guests I would have made every effort possible to correct it. I am appalled and disgusted. Ie contacted the news channels, the health department, and the better business bureau as well as all of my industry friends that Ie been making for the past 10 years in the industry.Good luck 16!If you care about your well being at all, DO NOT DINE HERE. Its a complete and total train wreck', 'wow what a view! its like having the Wrigley building clock as a wristwatch!service upfront is great...from walking into the hotel until you get seated...then things get a liiiitle iffy... table service is OK at best, which is upsetting because for that kind of money they should cut your food for you. overall the food is great...menu is very over written and if you are not a true foodie will have to ask your waiter a couple questions .... if you can find him...not sure if i would go back...but you have to go at least once for the view.', Absolutely gorgeous view...and we were at the perfect table to view the Navy Pier fireworks. Excellent wait staff- very attentive, patient (group of 8 girls...mildly liquored up at Rebar while waiting for table). Bonus amuse bouche and deserts- an unexpected treat.Food was pleasant, but small. Beautifully presented dishes- but for the most part they looked better than they tasted. We ordered plenty-- cheese plates, salads and entrees...but we were all still hungry when we left. Sadly, after the bill came- we didn't even have enough money to make a T-bay run., Why is it the more you pay, the more you expect?Every time I dine at a high end/high profile restaurant, I seem to expect more and when I don't get it, I'm disappointed. The caveat that makes me second guess myself is that if I had the same experience I had at Sixteen this weekend, but at half the price, I would have given 5 stars instead of the 3 here.Generally speaking, the food was above average to tasty. I thoroughly enjoyed my $40.00 scallop dish (think 3 scallops) and only... only half liked by deconstructed Caesar salad (the egg, although poached perfectly was just too much in volume as compared to the 3-4 pieces of greens accompanying it... and the pork belly on the side was... a bit dry, which isn't typical considering the amount of fat found on pork belly - let's put it this way: all I could taste was egg). Desserts were altogether yummy, although I've tasted them all before (or at least that's how I felt) at other restaurants in the city (i.e. nothing new or inventive from my point of view). Service was spot on and well tailored. We really had no complaint on this end. The dining room was... not my fave. Although there was the obvious wonderful view, I found the room to be sterile in that hotel kind of way (granted, it is in a hotel). Be forewarned, however,... if you are with a large party, the restaurant will need to split the group into 2 or more tables. If you're a New Yorker and you're used to this, then you have nothing to worry about. If, however, you are from Chicago, you're just going to have to get used to it., Considering this was one of the best meals I've ever had, I have no choice but to give it 5 stars.I was a little bit apprehensive that a place in a building run by Trump would be a little stuffy and unfriendly. Instead, everyone working there was cheerful, helpful, and - shockingly - had a sense of humor. Excellent service all around from the hostess to the wait staff to the sommelier. The layout of the place makes it seem much smaller and intimate than it actually is. From what I can tell, there are three separate sections with just a small number of tables in each. We were in the center of the three (just to the right of the wine cellar display) and there were maybe 8 tables in there, tops. Each section has a great view of the Wrigley Building, Trib Tower, and lake. Towards the end of the meal, we had a birds-eye view of the Navy Pier fireworks.They have an extensive wine list that can be a bear if you don't know what you want, but their staff will help you pick out something to your taste and in your price range. The cocktail list is solid as well. Try the Ol' Blue Eyes.I ordered the tenderloin and was pleasantly surprised to see the portion was fit for a full-grown human being. It was probably the best combination of presentation/quality and quantity that I've ever experienced. It was served with sides of horseradish risotto and snail ravioli. I know...snails can seem a little off-putting especially when they don't mask it by calling it 'escargot', but it was actually delicious.I'm not sure what other reviewers were eating, but after an appetizer, entree, and dessert, I was beyond stuffed. And I'm not a light eater as my girlfriend and doctor can attest. As far as the price, you're eating at a Trump restaurant. What the f--- did you expect?, This place is all about location, location, location. I recommend getting a window-table at 7:00 pm for dinner (summertime hours) to maximize your experience.The in-your-face view of the Wrigley Building, Tribune Tower, and other recognizable buildings that compose the magnificent Chicago skyline--plus the Chicago River in all its green glory, spilling through to Lake Michigan is worth the high tab you will eventually pay to dine as daylight slowly turns to breath-taking night lights. The food is well-prepared and seasoned. I particularly enjoyed a caesar salad with pork belly, perfectly cooked sea bass, and an egg-white / chocolate concoction for dessert. We were also presented with several amuse bouches, a sorbet, and a staircase of mini desserts complimentary and very delicious. The wine list was what you'd expect from a place with a gargantuan wine wall that greets you as you walk in. Service was friendly, attentive and helpful to our party of four. All in all, a good evening out with good friends., 'Went there for dinner and was not impressed at all. The service was not good - first off there were 9 of us with a reservation made a few months prior. When we arrived, they had set two very large round tables one could have held us all)...no one ever said we wouldn be seated together...after some persuasion and attitude from the staff, we were able to move the tables closer together at least. Then they proceeded to tell us that they could only serve 7 at a time if we didn all do the tasting menu so 2 people in our group would not get their food at the same time as the others! Again something no one ever bothered to relay in the 3 months the reservation was on the books. We didn all want to do the tasting menu so our host and co-host for the party said they would be served last then....In the end they did figure out how to serve the extra 2 people (ironically serving the hosts first) but at that point we were all appalled, pissed and shocked. Give me a break - this is supposed to be a place that goes above and beyond to make customers happy. My husband is a chef and there is no way he or his restaurant staff would ever say that to their guests. I eat fish, not land animals if you will, so I ordered fish for the app and entree. I always make sure they don throw bacon or anything into the mix and the server assured me and wrote it down on the ticket. Then they proceeded to give me a foie amuse! Again, at a place of this supposed caliber you would think someone would have been paying attention to the details...chef? Isn that part of your job?Serving the entrees was a disaster - the servers couldn figure out who had ordered what even though the db server took the orders straight down the table which involved not getting orders from the ladies first...So as the other servers assisting said quite loudly which one ordered this? another server was placing down the dishes in front of us and asking is this what you ordered? in a frustrated and annoyed tone.The food was just average. The fish was cooked well (I had the halibut) but the accompaniments lacked flavor and depth in every way. My husband was the same - he had the snapper. The crab app. was good except for the fact that I had 3 bites with crab shells I had to pick out of my mouth. When you pay this much for fine dining, you expect to have servers that are better than this and food that tastes better and without parts that don belong i.e. crab shells. I wasn expecting to have a wow experience with the food but a nice - this is really good  experience was expected. I didn get that at all. And the entire time, the manager went out of their way to avoid our table because they knew we were unhappy. Instead of trying to smooth things over and be apologetic and accommodating, they chose to avoid the situation all together. The host of our group that paid the bill found the manager after we were finished and thanked her for being able to serve everyone at the same time and the manager proceeded to infer that there was a lot of yelling in the kitchen because they had to serve 9 instead of their quota of 7. I think the place is pretentious and frankly not worth it. I can say I will never step foot in this place again. The view was nice but other than that nothing at all special. Thankfully I didn have to pay or I would have demanded a refund and an apology. It is just so ridiculous they can handle a party of 9. I think they should shut down and do some extensive training for their staff. Ugh.', For my fiance's birthday, I made reservations at Sixteen which had recently opened. I saw reviews from several newspapers raving about the food and thus was excited. We ordered crab cakes for appetizers and one other that I can't recall; it's been 5 months. My date ordered the duck, and I had the baby lamb. Sixteen is by far the best experience I've had at any restaurant PERIOD. The appetizers, entrees, and dessert were an explosion of flavors I've never experienced. The service was superb. The environment and view were very nice. My only gripe is that the prices are too high for me to go regularly; I'm not a millionaire :(I'll definitely be making regular trip annually., 'Sixteen has one of the best views in a downtown restaurant both inside and out. The elegant dining room is perfect for any special occasion. We went recently for brunch and found the food and drink to be superb. The selection ranges from omelets and pastries to beef tenderloin and king crab, all of which were presented beautifully and tasted equally fantastic!', 'If youe going to sixteen you have to be comfortable with two things:1. It is expensive. e.g. Brunch is $95/plate before drinks, tax and tip2. At least 50% of that price is a wow premium for being in the Trump space. The food is good, but youe paying for the Experience. For my money, the food is better at the Four Seasons brunch. But sixteen atmosphere and views are tough to beat. Service Accommodating and pleasant. I called twice with changes to our reservation within 24 hours of our seating and both times they were unflinching in taking care of us. Despite changing the time we wanted to come in and the number of people in our party, they still put us in a table on the window in the main dining room. Once seated, our server was a pro. Almost overly helpful, but you could tell he was sincere and we were definitely catered to.Space / AtmosphereStriking. Open flow with floor to ceiling windows that capitalize on the panoramic downtown views. The key design elements like the wall of wine or the massive chandelier are bold without being over the top dominant or distracting. The space is big enough to accommodate them. This is an instance where a 25 foot crystal chandelier fits. FoodThey had a nice range of the usual suspects for this kind of occasion. The omelet station, the carving station, the sushi station, great desserts, etc. What was there was certainly good. However, by comparison, the variety isn quite as extensive as what you see at the Four Seasons. Not sure what it says about me and my tastes, but two of the items I enjoyed most were from the kids station -- mac and cheese and sliders (you can take the boy out of the small town ... ). Net: sixteen is a good option if youe willing to splash out and your party really appreciates the environment. We were there for Father Day brunch and all things considered it was worth it. Star scoring scale:5 = Spectacular4 = Better than average, really enjoyed it3 = Average, don regret it2 = Disappointing1 = Abysmal', this was my second visit to Sixteen at Trump Tower... I left this time a little less satisfied than I had previously.My first visit was brunch, this was lunch.It seems like their prices have gone up slightly since my first visit... I looked over the breakfast menu and everything was $5 more than I had remembered it last time. Still not outrageous (and the claims that brunch is $95/plate just seem outright looney to me, unless it was some special brunch menu). On my last visit I had looked at the lunch menu, and now things are definitely higher priced than previously. Most sandwiches come out to be in the $25-30 range. For a sandwich. With waffle fries (they of course have to call them by their more pretentious sounding name pommes gaufrettes, which is French for waffle cut...)I had a slow roasted pork sandwich. it was very good. The bread it was on was really nice. The pork itself, was good. I have had just as good pork for 1/3 the price. But this place isn't about the price, nor is my giving it 3 stars... You're clearly paying a premium to walk into this door, so I'm not looking down upon them for that.The service this time, however, was was average at best. There weren't any tables all that close to us, yet the waitress was talking like we were in a library, to the point where you couldn't hear her. (Actually, we had an early start and were the first table for the lunch rush). We weren't in a rush to get out the door, but she clearly wanted us turned over as fast as possible (though again, they weren't even busy). She took our drink order 2 minutes after we sat, asked if we were ready to order food. We clearly weren't. Not even 3 minutes later, she came back... asked again... we clearly weren't still. A good waitress would've picked up on the fact that we weren't in a huge hurry and didn't need to keep coming back to make us feel like we were wasting her time. I had been performing the egregious activity of chewing gum, and looking around found nowhere to dispose of it as soon as I sat down. I asked her if she had a paper napkin, to which she said sure, but I'm pretty certain I got one of those eyeroll type looks as soon as she headed back to her waitress station. 5 minutes later, I had to ask for it again to a busboy, who was much nicer to accommodate such trivial matters. I think this waitress would be better suited working a hurried table-turning atmosphere of Grand Luxe than here, her contrived snootyness didn't work for me.Back to the food... I started off with a chilled corn bisque, which was tasty enough that I could have eaten that as my meal and be really happy. The sandwich was OK, but for ~$30 for a pulled pork sandwich you're better off going pretty much anywhere else if price to taste ratio is of concern. The waffle cut fries were tossed in a really nice truffle oil.. Cliched slightly these days, but flavor was spot on. Looking around, the crowd was mostly gray haired ladies, and decidedly not cutting edge.Still yearning for their outdoor patio to open... I don't think I'll be back until then., Loved it! I would compare this to Michael Mina.(So glad Chicago lifted the ban on Foie Gras! whew.)Be prepared to drop roughly $200.00 per person if you'll be drinking wine, but for a five-star dining experience, it's well worth every penny.Even my snotty Chucky-T's lovin' friend was impressed with what Sixteen had to offer!And with a great view, you may just catch the Navy Pier fireworks if you go on the right night!(only negative thing I have to add: the filtered water tastes funny here...spend the $12.00 on the water and you'll be a much happy camper.), 'Hmm...4 stars or 5? We did the blind tasting menu and it was fantastic although, I do recall being less-than-thrilled with a few of the offerings.Then again, that happened at French Laundry, too. And there were several courses that were lick-your-plate good...Plus the view was lovely and service was flawless...Ok, 5 stars it is.', Overall the food was good. I ordered the six course tasting menu with the wine parings. DO NOT get the wine parings for $50 more. They were the stingiest pours I have experienced. It included four glasses which were barely two sips each and amounted in total to one glass. I actually had to order a full glass of the red during one of the courses which was $14. You're much better off ordering by the glass. When I complained the waiter told me that more was too much for one person to drink and that the pours were small to not overwhelm the food. Yeah right., White chocolate bread. That's just one of those things that seem like it would be totally weird with your dinner but was actually amazingly good. Just like the walnut cocktail. Sounds manly perhaps, and a nut flavor is a bit strange for a cocktail, but it tasted fabulous. Everything else was also wonderfully subtle and bordering on sublime (amuse bouche, 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, 1 dessert).The main room had fabulous views and a gorgeous chandelier. We were in a side room, but still, it was very nice. The service was very pleasant. I have to admit I was predisposed to thinking that it was just going to be nothing but Trump-level hype, but I must say I was surprised by how good and sophisticated it was. Of course the prices reflected all that excellence, but that is to be expected from a place with the Trump name attached., The service was a 3. Our server seemed nervous!The food's presentation was a 4.The food's taste was a 3. They weren't serving anything special. I mean, it was halibut, scallops and the like. How about some halibut cheeks or wagyu beef?Let me first say that the view was VERY nice!!! My friend and I were initially taken aback by the view.... But they really need to put curtains on the side windows... If you've been there, you know what I mean. The room is dimly lit, a very romantic ambience. I keep describing it as a good proposal spot!! :) I think the chandelier is a bit Dynasty for my taste. We started at the little bar in the hall, while they set our table up. Yes, we were a little late for our reservations, but the restaurant was not full by any means. I opted for one of their specialty cocktails w/ apricot liqeur, brandy and some other things. The rim of the glass was coated with cinnamon. A bit too much actually...it left me quite--well, thirsty!! The vichyssoise was ok, a tad on the salty side. I really only had like 3 spoonfuls. The scallops I had as my entree were nothing to write home about. My friend ordered the halibut and seemed pleased, but he said he'd had better meals for that amount of money. I agree wholeheartedly. We ordered dessert which was A LOT better than the entrees. They also brought us out some tiny desserts, which I did not try. Man!!! I will have to return b/c I did not see what everyone was so impressed with....although I doubt my review will change much after a 2nd visit., I'm a gal with expensive taste; my boyfriend is a guy who could eat at White Castle everyday and never have a complaint. The fact that we both thoroughly enjoyed our meals at Sixteen is reason enough to give it five stars, but everything about our meal was exceptional.The decor and ambiance was very warm and inviting. There was enough space between tables to where we didn't feel right on top of the table next to us. The chandelier is very over-the-top but is gorgeous and fits well.Our waiter was wonderful and, unlike our waiter at Blackbird a few weeks prior, did not write us off when we decided against ordering alcohol. He was conversational, but not annoying, did not try to rush us out, and never let a dirty dish remain on our table for more than 10 seconds. As odd as this may sound, the bread was phenomenal. My boyfriend actually called the bread guy over at least four times because he loved the bread so much. I had an orange-blossom roll that was just so delightful. For my main dish I had the duck. I'm a huge fan of duck and this was by far the best piece i've had in a very, very long time. Though duck is naturally a very fatty meat, mine was not extremely fatty, but had so much flavor throughout. I ordered the Study of Chocolate for desert; while it was delicious, something tells me I should have ordered the Study of Strawberry instead.I am going there for Brunch on Thanksgiving with my mother and hope that it will be just as wonderful., The room is beautiful....The city views are even better. As nicely designed as it is, it's a little to stuffy for me, I can't really imagine coming here with my friends.The squash soup was reallllyyyy good. I had the world famous turkey burger for $26. While this was a good burger, definitely not good enough to be a $26 burger. My lunch partners have this recipe and have made it on their own and say that theirs came out even better. I would recommend the margarita. MMMmmmm, 'The restaurant was absolutely gorgeous and it offered spectacular views of the city. The food I say is good, not great, but just good. The service was better than the food. When I dine out, I love to have my salad and side vegetables, that wasn an option there. Would I go back or recommend it to my family and friends? NO! All I have to say to Mr. Trump, YOUE FIRED! ', I just think it is overrated as far as the cuisine goes.DO- go here for the ambiance, for the elegance, for the views, for the location, for the luxury, for a romantic meal.DO NOT- go here for luxurious service (it lacks), go here for outstanding food. I went here to screen this place for some international VIPs coming to town for my work. They are TOUGH customers. So I have a very strict check-list that I go through when I visit a new restaurant. I went her at about 2:30 for lunch on a weekday. EMPTY. But service was still slooooow, and unattentive. The dining room was breathtaking, but we soon grew tired of the meal. The desserts were yummy as was the coffee, but that's all I'd recommend going here for., After having my heart broken by having to cancel my PERFECT valentines day reservations in February, i finally got over to Sixteen in October for my birthday. It may have been for the best since i didn't get the bill at the end of the meal. Sixteen's atmosphere is amazing. I'd argue that it has a better view than the Signature Room, but it might be because you won't be surrounded by teens from Schaumburg. The dining room is exactly what you expect from Trump, large and in charge. The ceilings are ginormous and the decor is top notch. Definitely a great romantic place to bring someone you've been dating a while, or a first date if you're the obnoxious yuppie douchebag type that thinks the dinner is gonna get you laid. The menu had a lot to choose from and unless you're picky, I highly recommend the tasting menu (if you do appetizer, entree and dessert a la carte, it's about the same price as the tasting and you'll get extra small courses out if it). The tasting includes a scallop course that is not on the menu and is quite possibly the best dish i had in 2008! I LOVE scallops and often judge a restaurant depending on how they prepare scallop dishes since there is an infinite number of creative ways to serve them. Sixteen serves a PERFECTLY seared scallop (both my girlfriend and i agreed that they were tossing anything less than a 9.8 looking scallop in the trash) that is topped with a perfectly sized portion of perfectly cooked foie gras which is topped by this fried potato puff all floating on a perfectly sized portion of sweet potato. Notice a trend here? Yeah, the dish was perfection at it's finest! It was the PERFECT balance of savory and sweet and just melts in your mouth, total foodie orgasm But i have to be honest, other than the scallop, everything else was just really good, not great. To be fair, the desserts ALL looked AMAZING, but you get what the chef sends when you order the tasting so you can't choose. Maybe it's because every course but 2 followed that amazing scallop and i was expecting too much after it, but i really do think that for the price, Sixteen is just not worth what they are charging. The wait staff was top notch and the ingredients were only of the freshest and most high calibur, but that's expected when the prices are as high as they are. I'd definitely go back for dessert and drinks, but I'm not so sure there's any reason to try other appetizers or entrees for the price. I'd give them another chance for dinner, but it probably won't be for quite some time seeing as there are much better restaurants i've eaten at for the money. Unless you're going strictly for the view, I'd recommend Graham Elliot or NoMi in the same neighborhood for better food at a similar price (or even cheaper). To the best of my knowledge, the restaurant doesn't pay rent, it's owned by Trump so they could easily lower the prices about 10-12%. It would be a great place to go if they did. But for the price, i expect a little more, i actually left a little hungry and that's unacceptable after plunking down $250 plus for a meal., Difficult to review. I was with a party of 4 so one of us was going to have our backs to that stunning view of the lit up Wrigley clock tower. As we were paying I chose too have my back to this view. However, I think Sixteen has made a big mistake of having the wall facing in so plain. OK there is 1 massive mirror so I could see the view but its tall and narrow. In my opinion the entire back wall which is a gorgeous color is plain and should have multiple mirrors so that the room feels like it is entirely view and mirrors. That way noone misses out on the view. Because of this I felt the place lacked ambience. When I was sitting on the opposite side briefly the view was breathtaking. So I felt like Trump had not thought this view out for people sitting in seats not facing the window. An easy fix so I suggest they fix it fast. If I was sitting facing the view it would have been fantastic and I would have incrfeased the star rating.Service was pretty good, our server was very nice and relatively attentive.The menu is small which I like but I have to say nothing jumped out at me which is shocking really as I do like a good meal and am a relatively sophisticated diner. Also on looking at the prices if I had three courses we were talking $90 so I chose the 6 course tasting menu at $95 as did our whole table.The overarching taste of the whole meal was sweetness. Too much sugar, purees, and sweetness to the whole meal. Plus I always always always eat too much bread. I only had two very good wholegrain rolls but I wish they wouldn't serve bread, it adds nothing and slightly blunts your appetite. In future I will not take any bread at all.There was a blue cheese mash type course with some kind of Apple puree. I hate blue cheese as it is so overpowering and my first mouth full was a bit of a shock. However, when I paired the blue cheese mash with the apple puree it was a divine combination so I ate it all. For me blue cheese is just gone off cheese, I can't see the attraction to it, but this way I could. OK so I am not that sophisticated :o).The biggest disappointment was the duck course. I Mean it was just a lump of flavorless flesh and the portion was two times too big. The mash it came with was divine as it had some kind of nutty caremalised crust. My partner didn't like it but i found it wonderfull especially after the disappointment with the duck. The duck was cooked fine more or less medium to slightly rare. I know duck is difficult but they should pull this this item as its really not very pleasant and spoiled the meal.There was a pre desert which was some kind of mouse and crubly biscuit top. Pretty non descript and didn't taste of too much. Also stupidly the base of the glassware it was served in was too narrow for the spoon. So I had to turn my spoon upside down and use the handle to get the remainder of the mouse out. Not very professional and a very bad example of someone not considering the utensils for the job. Not classy!The desert itself was nice but too big. It was a trio of chocolate deserts. All of which were very pleasant. I suppose for a big fat person it would not be a problem to wolf it down but I was already struggling. None of the portions were huge as is appropriate for a tasting menu but I guess the bread pushed me over the edge. I think Iiif I had been hungrier I might have struggled less. Saying that I did eat them.Then coffee arrived which was nice with some more small chocolates and sweets. Nice and expected of course but we couldn't eat them.I will definately give them credit as we were with non meat eating couple who ate fish and they altered the tasting menu to accomodate them with no problem which was great.SO to sum up. In general the tasting menu was great apart from the massive failure of the Duck course. I mean really not good. DO come starving so you can fully appreciate the flavors and number of courses.Would I go back? Very difficult. Probably not unless someone else was paying and then I would make sure I didn't eat all day. The view alone is worth it though just skip wine and have just 2 courses then it is an affordable treat.We came up from the bar downstairs which is one of the most overpriced, , uncomfortable bars I have ever been in. I mean sooooo overpriced but that is a different review.The wine menu is over priced in a major way as is the bar., '1. Go2. Try, ultimately in vain, to pretend you are not supporting Donald Trump. This will prove impossible as his name is emblazoned on everything from the liveried doormen to the napkins beneath your cocktail, but it will make you feel better to try.3. Don even bother looking at the prices, unless you need a conversation piece that will inspire shock, awe and hilarity in the near future. The adage if you have to ask... was written for places like this.4. Really enjoy the view. REALLY. You are floating amidst the turrets, crenellations and minarets of Jazz-age Chicago, all brilliantly lit as if for your pleasure alone. Conversation will seem superfluous, even distracting. Over food, drinks and service, this will be your memory of the experience, believe me.', 'I recently went there for a birthday celebration, and the wait staff and food were simply amazing! I made the reservation through Open Table and left a special note that we were celebrating a birthday. The wait staff had champagne waiting and gave us complimentary chocolate covered strawberries for the occasion. I would definitely go back there to try the tasting menu, and if I am adventurous, I would be tempted to experience the blind tasting menu!', 'If I could give zero stars, I would do it. I know food and this is by far the worst and most expensive place that I have ever dined at. My wife and I had the 5 course tasting menu. Not one course was good, as you would expect at $100,- per person. And watch out for the wine prices. This place is a complete rip off. There are many other places in Chicago to get a great meat. This is not one of them!!!!!!!!!!!!!', Framing: My good friends took me and my partner out to dinner at this restaurant. I did not see the final bill because my friend was paying and that would be rude. Thus, my comments are based on pricing from the menu. We went here while construction on the building was still underway, as I believe it still is.The good: Great food with wonderful flavors. Amazing view, if you can get somewhere near the windows.The bad: The smallest bar ever for an upscale restaurant. EXTREMELY overpriced. Snooty service at the hostess stand, bar, and some of the waiters.My question is whether Trump will give up on the restaurant before he gives up on the building.I think they need to try again. Chicago typically does not tolerate bad value food and ok service for a very long time and I'm not sure there are enough tourists in this neighborhood for this restaurant to survive.One of the worst values for the money in the City of Chicago in my opinion. Because it is pricier than North Pond and the servings much smaller than a normal restaurant, I give it two stars to North Pond's 3. Sixteen has really good food and decor, but is just way too pricey for the uber small servings., I must say I would have not gone here if it wasn't for an out of town friend wanting to check out Trump Hotel and Sixteen as I'm not a Trump fan. But if I had passed, with the exception of dessert, I would have missed out on an extraordinary dinner.The main course was exquisite and a taste explosion. The appetizer was delicious. Very tender prime rib, nicely cut and lean. Wonderfully done!Barramundi fish with mango puree was a taste sensation for my senses. The fish skin was slightly crisp and went well with the smooth, soft tender fish. Melt in your mouth good.The dessert was lacking and a disappointment. There were cool chocolate discs with some caramelized sugar in an artistic display. Sadly it ended there. It strangely resembled what they have in their hotel rooms. It just could have been tastier, more thought out and a better portion for something that is the cost of a meal.The waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful. I was very impressed! The service was definitely A+. Unfortunately, I cannot remember his name, only that he had dirty blondish hair and this was during the thanksgiving holidays but he was awesome! The atmosphere is one of a slight air. Don't be surprised if you run into trophy wives dining with their children and nannies here as I observed. Very spacious dining area with vaulted ceilings which give way to a dramatic scene of the Chicago river and skyline on a good weather day. Very contemporary and clean. You wont find much embellishment in the decor. A wide selection of wines which I passed on but are nicely displayed as you make your way through to the dining area. The entrance to the restaurant is kinda bright for night dining. Minimal and contemporary.Overall it was a wonderful experience. Though the cost would keep me from coming back. Only on a special occasion would I make a trip back. But I enjoyed the experience. I was going to take a point off because of the dessert. But the appetizer and main course was spectacular so I added an extra point., 'If you want a special dining experience, please go to Sixteen. My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here, and could not have picked a better place. The place is beautiful, elegant, and nicely lit - and of course, the views are to die for. Service was well-timed and everything ran like clockwork! Immaculate, in fact. We chose that evening prix-fixe menu, which included more courses than what was listed. Knowing that it was our anniversary, they brought a plate of chocolate-covered strawberries with a chocolate placard that read Happy Anniversary. Very classy. The details in this place are what make it so special and beautiful. Every serving plate, etc is a little piece of artwork in itself. Of course it is on the higher end of the budget, but definitely a lovely special occasion restaurant to add to your list.', 'I was extremely disappointed with the food quality and wait staff at Sixteen. I went with co-workers on a Friday for lunch. First, the staff should have tested how long we wanted to spend at lunch. 2 hours when you work is likely too long.Even worse, they messed up my order once, and when returning it, I got a wadded up, wet paper napking (I think?!?) in my salad. I cannot tell if it was because they used a napking to wipe off the salad dressing I asked for on the side... or if it comes in all salads. The view and space are great. But definitely not worth it for bad food and bad service at that price.', 'A year after they opened, still 5 stars. But the food has moved down half a star.Sixteen, in the Trump building, has the best service of any restaurant anywhere. Anywhere. No, it not in a league of its own. But no one is better. It on the top tier with only a few others. It not hovering service, but it lacks nothing. We had friendly conversations with both our waiter and the waiter from our prior visit who stopped by to say hello. We had discussions with them about the menu, where they worked before, and their thoughts on other Chicago restaurants. Every staff person I made eye contact with smiled and was genuinely friendly. And never once did I have a dining need that wasn anticipated.Ambiance: I call it a minimalist dd9cor. Very simple, no art on the walls, high ceilings, fabulous views. Absolutely terrific views if youe there before and at sunset. Simple but classy vases on the tables. It was very comfortable and classy, with, as mentioned in my prior review, table spacing far enough apart that you were not part of other people conversations.Alcohol: We started with great kirs, made with a high quality white wine, which made them taste perfect. The wine list was huge - 11 pages of red wines alone. Very international. There was an entire page of 24 Australian reds (no doubt because the chef is Australian). We had a bottle of the best Chablis Ie ever had, a 2004 1st cru Vaillons. Then we ended with a nice port.Food: A very good friend refuses to dine in top end restaurants that do not post menus, or at least sample menus, on their websites. Sixteen is one of those. And I understand the point, but have been coming back to Sixteen because (1) we had a great first experience, and (2) their Australian chef brings in Australian ingredients and develops great dishes. With no menu for you to look at online, here my overview: Fabulous ingredients and combinations of tastes, which consistently overwhelm the basic ingredient, to the point you can barely tell what the basic dish is.The menu has only six appetizers, six main courses, and six desserts. The bacon gnocchi amuse-bouche was terrific. Four breadroll choices - the white chocolate and orange roll was unique and tasty, as was the roll with scallions. We both ordered the foie gras appetizer. Sauteed foie gras, ramps, white asparagus, prosciutto, and quail spring roll. The pork belly dish we previous tried is now Braised pork belly, pork taco, red pepper gastrique, and pineapple roulade. The foie gras appetizer was delicious, with lots of flavors and textures. It was like an exotic plate of tapas. But as my wife said, paying $26 for foie gras, you expect more than two bites of foie gras. For main courses, I went with the John Dory, which I loved on our first visit. On the menu: John Dory, tempura squash blossom, cumin polenta, and carrot jus. Sorry, but this was terrible. The dish overall tasted wonderful. But buried in with the other ingredients, the overcooked John Dory might as well have been a Lake Superior whitefish. There was no John Dory flavor, no John Dory texture, no John Dory tenderness. It was a very tasty dish, but I was expecting John Dory. Janet had a crusted scallops dish (sorry, I didn write down the specifics), and she loved them. To show what else is on the menu, the duck she had previously is now Roast duck breast, keema matar, panisse, morels, pea and coconut sauce.We shared a cheese plate for dessert. It was adequate - six cheeses. I was less than impressed with the assortment, lacking in variety of textures. So the meal was a delightful experience of different tastes and textures. Well done. But totally subject to what the chef wanted to serve, ignoring what the menu said the item was. That seems to be the trend - order a 20-course tasting menu and sit back to eat whatever the waitperson brings you, play guessing games to identify the flavors he/she told you is in each dish, and somehow feel honored to be paying the enormous bill. That just not my interest in fine dining. So Sixteen remains a five star restaurant in my book, more because of the service and ambiance, but Takashi and Les Nomades will get my business going forward when we want fine dining.', 'Not bad. Which is a helluva thing considering how much they charge, but it was ok. The view was outtasight. Floor to ceiling windows with a super cool view of the lake, trib tower, and downtown. Service was curt but quick. It was $8 for a beer, 18 for essentially a so-so greasy burger and waffle fries. This didn surprise me as the name Trump was associated, though. You expect a hit in the wallet, thankfully it was a work thing so I didn foot the bill myself. I come back here for a special occasion as the view is wicked cool but for a lunch thing I thought it was much ado about...well, not nothing, but not much.', 'Sunday brunch at 16 is perfect for my family and myself. The buffet is large and has several options for picky eaters (like my kids). It is reasonably priced and for a self serve buffet, the service was still right on. We loved the display of desserts and the great drinks that were available. For anyone with kids or people looking to enjoy a truly great brunch, 16 is definitely the place go to. The view was fantastic too!'|2
46|sons-and-daughters-san-francisco|One of the owners/chefs trekked up a mountain to his apartment, AND back down the mountain with a stack of broken down boxes spilling outta his arms, and all over into the street *after* an exhausting day of restaurant renovations, (that they are doing themselves) *just* to give me boxes for my move. Because of that, I don't care what their food tastes like, they are A-OK w/me :). Cheers to your grand opening S&D's! Can't wait for that coffee., 'Truly enjoyable evening ..... GREAT and interesting food ..... wonderful atmosphere ...... we will be back!', Creative dishes with exquisite and subtle flavors, savored in a hip yet elegant atmosphere. Can't wait to eat there again., I would definitely recommend Sons & Daughters, it's great to see young chefs starting their own place! All the dishes I tasted were delicious and creative--mostly small to medium size plates that were good for sharing, I'd recommend the $48 tasting menu which let you pick 3 dishes and a dessert. Things I recommend:The black cod was cooked perfectly, it was really tender and it came in a broth with mushrooms and uni garnish (which I usually hate at sushi places but it was just the right amount and not too overwhelming).The squab was also amazing, especially the little claw that came as part of the presentation--it was just so cute. The service was great, everyone that works there seems young and passionate about the food and wine they serve. They also gave us 2 free amuse-bouches during the meal which were a nice touch. The dd9cor is also amazing, love the purple ceiling, the cute little lounge area with vintage furniture, and the giant black & white close-ups of food. Ask to see the wine room in the downstairs, which has a beautiful old wood table with stools pulled around it., I ate here shortly after they opened and had a great experience. The menu is so unique and delicious, it's kind of unforgettable. I can't wait to go back.Also, the service was superlative, and the place has this great hip-but-elegant vibe. A comfortable, casual atmosphere. I recommend this restauraunt to everyone., 'I ferried my ass across the Bay, and stopped by Fussy Fusspot office to pick up my sweet poodle. Fussy was adorned in a bright blue sequined scarf that he draped over his head as if he was on his way to a disco mosque. We climbed upon a cable car and sparkled up California Street. Clang, clang went the trolley. The guy who stood in front of us hanging on to the streetcar handlebar had nice shoes. Fussy and I were headed to the Rrazz Room to check out Sam Harris cabaret act. Sam and I share a history, and that all Il say about that because Sammy doesn know it. But before the show we of course had to eat!I chose Sons and Daughters. This restaurant opened last week, and in my opinion this place is on their way to making it BIG in the San Francisco culinary circle. Dinner was simply exquisite. The chef assembled an intelligent menu where complex meets creativity. A multitude of flavors and textures unfolded in every bite as we moved from course to course. Ingredients were prepared in ways I have never seen or heard of before and every plate brought to our table was a work of art. I see many Michelin stars in their future. The dd9cor was lovely as well as the staff. We were well attended to throughout our meal and we will surely return soon. Fussy Fusspot had tears in his eyes when Sam Harris sang Bette Midler, In My Life, to me; I not sure if he was moved by Sam touching performance or if he was recalling his last delicious bite of squab with tiny edible balloons of honey from Sons and Daughters.', So we had an amazing meal here last night. This place has been open for about a week, and you can feel the freshness of the food, the approach, and the staff. They want to run an amazing restaurant, and are looking to wow their first customers/regulars. Young chefs with really strong ideas -- each dish had one item in it that was unexpected, yet worked perfectly. Raw lobster with, um, dried roe? Delicious. An Herb salad with curds (I'd never eat goat cheese again if I could get my hands on that stuff) with eucalyptus? Amazing. The risotto was rich and creamy (raw egg, marscapone, and truffles). Great wine list, and an amazing selection of different beers kept showing up at the table next to me. The space is a little awkward, but the location near Union Square will give me a place to go to in the area. So go here now, become a regular, and earn your place -- because this team is going to be making some of your favorite food for a long time., I feel very lucky to have discovered this fantastic little restaurant before people catch on and it becomes packed (which it will, believe me).Six of us at here last night and I can't think of anything that would get less than 5 stars. The atmosphere is perfect. It's small, smart but not upscale, you can see the kitchen right in the middle, and they play cool music (they were playing Boards of Canada when I arrived). The staff were friendly, attentive, funny and incredibly enthusiastic. But it was ALL about the food. We all chose the 4 course tasting menu but it ended up being way more. All in all they gave us two amuse-bouches and two other complimentary small plates! I've never experienced such generosity and good service. We also chose wine pairings which was definitely a good decision. After the first melon based amuse-bouche we were all treated to the (complimentary) curds and whey taster which was refreshing, tasty and looked beautiful. I followed this with the raw Lobster with caviar which was a total party in my mouth. And the wine pairing was perfect. In fact I think they gave us a complimentary extra wine tasting which was a very nice touch.Next up was the Black Cod with Uni and mushroom. SO GOOD! The tender texture of the cod was like eating a soft egg-white. After this was yet ANOTHER complimentary bite (these guys were really trying to please) the Risotto with black truffle. My only slight criticism was that it was quite salty. For my main course I had lamb that had been cooked in hay, with a very green herbal oil drizzle. The lamb was sweet, tender and just perfect. Finally the desert. I tried both the chocolate truffle cake and the plum cream thing. Both very tasty.The food was contemporary, interesting, and delicious. The staff were young and enthusiastic. All in all it was a great evening. I can't wait to go back. San Francisco needs more places like this., This restaurant is a great little find. They've opened up recently after Cafe Mozart closed down.First off, this place is VERY different from Cafe Mozart. The whole interior has been spiced up with a great casual and contemporary feel. The clean and simple black and white photography decor go perfectly with the furniture set up - not cramped at all, cozy yet not cramped.The large windows allow outside light to spill in (and especially now while it is summer, it remains bright even late) - as the night progresses, the staff will light up the chandeliers and doorstep lamps. The ambience is perfect - upbeat yet not overbearing.The open kitchen in the center of the restaurant also adds to the experience - you feel involved being so close to the food preparation; they have nothing to hide.And I haven't even got to the food yet - the food is incredible! The menu is a great mix of Californian and Italian. Sons & Daughters has found a great combination of fresh ingredients, clean presentation, and interesting flavor combinations to create a wonderful tasting menu. You can't go here without getting the tasting menu - the portion sizes are small, so you can't have a full meal without 3-4 courses.The main courses were so good that they overshadowed the dessert - not particularly memorable, but the experience and food, especially for a brand new restaurant, combine to make a 5-star winning experience and comes highly recommended!, Sons & Daughters is fantastic. If you are reading this, read no further and go check it out for yourself right now. I knew about this place because my good friend grew up with some of the owner/chefs. We were lucky enough to go and try this place out before the hordes of people figure it out, and it turns into a 3 hour wait spot like so many SF establishments. When we went, it was busy, but not packed - after-all, it had only been open for a week. The remodel they did to this place is great. Modern, clean, hip (not not snobby), and great decor. It's a bit intimate, i.e. cramped, but that is fine too. We didn't need to lounge in the hang out spot, but it looks like a great place to hang out while waiting for a table. The service was friendly, polite, and prompt. They came at just the right pace - not fast, nor slow. The food was fantastic. There were 4 of us eating, which meant that we tried nearly every thing on the menu. My favorite on the menu was the sweetbreads. The main that I got was the risotto which had an egg on top, but I like my wife's lamb much better. The Foie torchon was excellent as well. We knew the chef's are obsessed with it, and it shows with each bite of this dish which takes up to 4 days to prepare. Definitely go here for a romantic, special dinner. You will not go wrong. The price is nothing to scoff at, but then again, you pay for what you get. The only knock I have is the music selection! While eating a romantic, kind of pricey dinner, they were blasting music ranging from Elton John, to Tom Petty (the cheesy stuff), to Dylan and beyond. Not that I don't like all the music they played, but it was loud, and didn't suite the mood. I hope this restaurant takes off and does great., Great energy here. Watch the chef/owners in an open kitchen. Different tastes and foods to try, a little exotic, a little adventurous, all served with elegance and panache. Great vibe; intimate; lively. An exciting new entry in San Francisco's culinary culture., GO TRY THIS RESTAURANT BEFORE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A RESERVATION! The food was fantastic and the place is delightful.My Hottie Blade and I had tickets for a Cabaret Show at the Rrazz Room and my Hottie Blade picks Sons & Daughters for dinner. It's new, he says, we should try it. I'm suspicious but willing to give it a try. O.M.G my Hottie Blade was so right!To be fare to all of the other restaurants we need to rate it on the Fussy Fusspot Scale. So here goes starting with the cleanliness scale...Clean table and dishes? 5 of 5 points.More than clean, they were spotless.Clean server? 5 of 5 points.Yes, yes indeed.Clean bathroom? 5 of 5 points.Clean, with hot water (see Bistro Central Parc for an explanation of why hot water is sooooo important) and clean towels. Nice.Subtotal = 15 of 15 Fussy Points on the Clean Scale. Perfect Score!.Service? 5 of 5 points.Prompt, polite and efficient.Ambiance and Decor? 5 of 5 points.Nicely furnished and comfortable.Menu Options? 5 of 5 points.Inventive, interesting, appetizing. I wanted to try almost everything on the menu. The 4 course prix fixe is a great option.Food? 10 of 10 points. Fussy Fusspot almost never gives 10 of 10 on the Food Scale. But Son & Daughters is different. It was really really really good. Really.Price/Food ratio? 4 of 5 points.$107 for 2 people including a couple glasses of wine, 2 entrees and 2 main courses.Bonus? 3 of 5 points.We arrived a little early for our reservation and they showed us to a comfortable waiting room where we ordered a glass of wine to begin - 1 bonus point for the room itself and 1 bonus point for the service in there. And the food. Have I mentioned the food? Oh so good. 1 more bonus point for the food.Total: 46 Fussy Fusspot Points., I used to walk by this spot all the time since I live about 4 blocks away, it was the Mozart Romantic Restaurant (or some shite like that). My partner had heard about it so we called and made a reservation about 30 minutes before showing up. The decor is super rocken, very modern chic great find from a second hand shop, I'm guessing or they were able to find goods that appeared that way. The chandeliers are a great touch as are the black and white photos. Everyone that works there is super friendly and nice, it reminds me more of an LA spot (even compared to the Mission dist. it was LA seeming which = good thing). The music was odd, SO PLEASE CHANGE IT! It started off with this soft funk and then switched to 90s rock and then went to Bowie, it was obviously on a cd changer and it needed more focus. Find a theme and stick with it. It was odd going from soft and soothing to loud rock.  I' m astonished as to how anyone can handle going up and down those darn stairs with a tub full of dirty dishes, it was bothering me just watching folks have to do it yet I suppose with the size constraints and the cute open kitchen its the way it has to be -- Both amuse bouches were lovely as was my tasty curds and way salad, and the risotto main course, I can't remember the app. but it wasn't too too memorable. The chocolate cake was like a thick brownie that had been taken out of a fridge for an hour to soften up (not a fan) however the bread pudding was super good. If we had skipped the dessert wines, which easily racked up an extra $40 it would have remained reasonable and worth it but it somehow seemed just a tad bit too much in the end. I'd go back. It's cute, local and good., Please don't tell anyone else about this place for at least a little bit of time, because I'm sure this place will be mobbed once the reviews come in, and I'd like to go be able to actually get a table there a few more times... Definitely one of the best new restaurants I've eaten at in a long time. The squab cooked sous vide was cooked perfectly (with claw still on!) and probably the stand-out, but everything from wine list to dish composition was great, and definitely not unreasonable for the quality. My one complaint was that the risotto didn't have enough of the black truffle come through, but was still very good., not pretentious at all which is hard for some San Francisco restaurants. Wanted to dine somewhere nice for my birthday and found this on yelp.The decor is really cozy and chic. When we walked in they were playing bay area gangster rap!!! funny because it kinda matched the place.server was really attentive and helpful.pre-pixe 4 course menu for $48 !! dishes were small but filled you up. didnt take long for each course to come out. dining room flowed.OPEN KITCHEN!! so you can see everything!flavors of all the dishes were very well prepared. * lamb was amazingly tender. * herb salad was surprisingly delicious because i usually don't like herb salads.*cod was light and fluffy.* lobster carpaccio was sweet * foie torchon was the BEST i've ever had. it had a dehydrated yogurt and pear gelee with fresh peaches. yummm!!!i would come back again once they change their menu =)they've only been opened for about 3 weeks now., 'Perfect for a dinner before a show. Delicious complex food (think lobster carpaccio) at reasonable prices ($80 for four courses with generous wine parings) and a staff that works very hard to give you an elegant dining experience. Yet casual enough to feel comfortable in jeans and tennis shoes. Cute little lounge (parlor?) downstairs to enjoy a drink before or after dinner. And we do know something about gourmet food Micky T... Not quite Saison but less than half the price.', Went there with friends and had some amazing surprises from this creative staff...Don't have time to do the full review now...but check it out during the summer before it gets REALLLLLLYYYY packed in November...., Went with the tasting menu for $48 pp. Tax was included in the menu price.Herb salad and lamb loin: amazing. Two separate amuse bouche courses were both pleasant surprises. But everything else ranged from decent to forgettable. With such a small menu, and at this price, I was hoping for more consistency. Between the two of us we tried just about everything, and came away a bit disappointed.There were other oddities: the music, for example, was quite distracting. The space is divided between a lively kitchen and dining area on one side, and what seems like overflow seating on the other side. We were seated in the latter; service was still attentive, but I felt like we were missing out on the action.I think there is a lot of potential for Sons & Daughters to be great, but right now I don't feel compelled to return., 'Simply amazing.For $50 each my date and I got a 4 course menu that rivaled anything Ie had at Fleur de Lys. The smart casual atmosphere is classic and understated without being stuffy. They managed to have my 5 favorite indierock musicians on rotation on their playlist. The waitstaff was simply fantastic- helpful, attentive, knowledgable, and down to earth. Sons and Daughters is not snobby, but it is delightfully foodie. I am a pretty experienced eater, but in this one meal I was introduced to more than 5 ingredients I had never tasted before, including toasted lobster roe and the herb chervil. Artful combinations of flavor and texture and presentation.They gave us a completely flawless meal from start to finish.It a small place, so get reservations because Sons and Daughters is going to be very popular. If you are the sort of person who loves Beretta and you are looking for somewhere for more of a mellow sit-down, multi-course meal, this would be a good bet for you.', 'The boy and I went to Sons and Daughters for my birthday dinner after I read about the opening on Thrillist and Julie B. It hasn gotten much play on yelp yet, so I decided to check it out while I could still easily get reservations. And for $48 for a 4 course prix fixe with $38 wine pairings, I knew the price couldn be beat.The interior is small but cozy and chic with great chandeliers, a parlor area and beautiful purple walls and ceilings. The small open kitchen is adorable and though it feels homey the food certainly is more refined. Contrary to other reviews, I actually liked the music selection. It felt like they cycled on their favorite Pandora station that was full of youthful electronica and funkalicious beats. Their amuse was beautiful but not exactly memorable. For first course, I had the lobster carpaccio and the boy had the foie with peaches and brioche. The lobster with sturgeon caviar and coral was delicate and absolutely decadent with very high quality caviar. The foie was luscious served with a wonderful sauterne.For second courses, I had the sweetbread and lobster claw while my date had the scallop with veal tea. My sweetbread was cooked perfectly with a chickpea puree but the standout really was the perfectly cooked scallop. And by veal tea I mean super rich jasmine flavored jus. It was actually mind blowing.Main courses were actually the most underwhelming part of the meal. I had the lamb loin, which was not memorable in the slightest; and he had the squab, which was beautifully presented and a great texture. I also thought the wines paired with both of these had too many tanins. The pluot foam refresher was astonishing because it completely cleared our palats. Following that came the chocolate cake and honeydew melon soup deserts. The soup really surpassed my expectations and the dessert wines paired with both were exceptional. As parting gifts, the restaurant left us with bruleed pineapple pieces. The timing of the meal was excellent (not terribly hard with the size of the restaurant) and the service was attentive. They still need a little time to come into their own completely, but I would check them out before they become too popular to get a reservation.', I'm not going to lie, I'm a bit buzzed as I write this but I just had a delectable dinner at Sons & Daughters. The restaurant just opened up 3 weeks ago in my neighborhood and is a splurge in mouth at a reasonable price.The menu items are all extremely unique with combinations of ingredients you wouldn't think you pair up and the wait staff is super attentive and informative about the different courses and complimentary tastings in between courses.The lobster carpaccio with roe and dill was perfect and the foie tourchon was buttery and rich. We also got the truffle egg risotto which is as good as risotto can get (never been that big of a fan of it). All in all, neighborhood gem. Definitely think it will get discovered and become big soon and a worthy try., Tried this a few weeks ago on a weeknight and LOVED it. Great ambience (open kitchen, small space, arty feel), super friendly service and amazing food. Everything is beautifully presented and as others have pointed out, the tasting menu with wine pairings is fantastic value. Must try dishes: raspberry mousse, lobster carpaccio, herb salad. See here for pics and more: bit.ly/9xj8is I took one star off because the risotto was pretty bland (in general, I'd say the entrees were not as strong as the appetizers). That said, these guys are new and are probably experimenting around (menu changes regularly) so I'm sure it'll get even better. Go check them out!, The food is incredible. The Foie Torchon was outstanding. The caramel milkshake had a toasty bittersweetness that made me swoon. Great flavors and textures overall. If you plan on going, come hungy and don't skimp. Get the tasting menu; it's well worth the price. I'll be very surprised if Michelin doesn't award them a star, as the food is on par with heavy hitters like Aqua and Jardiniere, but at a fraction of the cost.Service is polite, attentive, unpretentious, informative. The ambiance is on the casual side, although the decor is still lovely and sophisticated., If you haven't been, it's great. Portions are small but their 4 course is only $48. The lobster Carpaccio and foie were great. The lobster was super fresh. The foie is more like a pate. The scallops were good, but slight old because they had that old seafood taste that tells you something is old. The sweetbreads weren't bad either, but the lobster that was part of that was way tastier. Why? Because the sweetbreads had an intestinal taste to them. Risotto was to die for! Right amount of creamy with truffles and the egg! The egg with salt added flavor and gooey-ness. YUM! Dessert was okay. We had the panna cotta with raspberry and Riesling gel. Neither of us wanted a date milkshake. I changed my panna cotta to a vanilla bean ice cream with a Riesling gel. The ice cream was good and melded fine with the Riesling gel.The ambiance was great. There's even a neat little waiting area on a lower level that's great for sitting and having a drink until you are seated. Service was attentive and polite. Just what I like., 'Sons and Daughters offers a fantastic menu with creative dishes and a beautiful presentation. The wine pairing was exquisite and the service was seamless. We loved this place and highly recommend it!! The herb salad and lobster carpaccio were just two of the outstanding dishes on the menu.', 'Fabulous little California/French restaurant. Lovely atmosphere. Great Service. Love the food. The tasting menu for $48 is a real value. Support this gem!', i've been here twice now and thoroughly enjoyed both times. everyone is super friendly and casual, which is a refreshing change for such refined food. our server andrea is a hoot.everything was delicious. (and this last time, we had been to coi the night before). i'm in love with the sweetbread and lobster claw. although the menu does not look vegetarian friendly, just let them know beforehand, . . . say when you make your reservations. chefs matt and teague created a vegetarian tasting menu for my dining companion. it did not feel or look like an afterthought, like at some other restaurants.there's an eclectic and well-chosen wine list, which i look forward to exploring on subsequent visits. the late harvest zin hit the spot with the chocolate cake and mint ice cream., Holly F. and her beau raved to us about Sons & Daughters. Since Holly knows her food, I had to see what had made her so happy. The first thing that struck us about the restaurant was how small and pretty it was. You practically walk right into the kitchen as you enter. The super high ceilings were painted black to bring a more intimate air. We were seated by the window with a lovely view of the Nob Hill Theatre-awesome. One wonders why they didn't add sheer window treatment to dampen the noise (it gets really noisy in there) and diffuse the street view. We started off with a compressed melon amuse with one pink peppercorn to garnish. I loved the burst of pepper with the dense melon - it was the perfect way to start off a meal clean and complex flavors.Since we opted for complementary courses of the pre-fixe, we got to try everything. I didn't know which I liked more the lobster carpaccio or the foie torchon. Both were amazing for exactly opposite reasons - the carpaccio was sweet and light while the foie was rich and decadent.I also really enjoyed my sous-vide squab. It was cooked rare like I like it and was very flavorful. I also tried the marscapone risotto with truffles - amazingly decadent. I much preferred the chocolate cake to the panna cotta - the panna cotta had not set yet and was soupy. If the panna had been on point, I would have been inclined to award S&D five stars. Since this restaurant is new, I am chalking this up to a newbie mistake. I have a feeling that S&D will be a favorite for service, value and exciting preparations., Alright people, this is it! This is going to be the next big, busy, 3 hour wait, you can't get into but wish you could. Go now before it blows up. The food is thoughtful, whimsical and crave-able. The wine pairings are incredibly spot on. Service is fun but professional, intimate but unobtrusive, informative but not pretentious. We really felt taken care of. You can tell that everyone wants to make your experience memorable. I can't wait to go back., 'Always looking for new places to try, this small menu was definately intriguing. The head chef Matt is a artist not only in how his dishes appear, but how they taste. I have never had so many flavors explode across my palet as I have at this restaurant. We chose to go with the 4 course and wine pairing, and it was amazing in every way. I look forward to returning to this small charming restaurant again.', I was so excited to try this place since some of my friends had positive things to say, as well as all the rave reviews right here on the ole Yelpster. So why don't I agree?ATMOSPHERE: Almost cool, kinda funky. The waiting room was nice, but the garage sale furniture and LED tea lights on the tables made it feel super cheesy. Are they attempting to be ironic? FOOD: I convinced the same friends I had dined with the week prior at Prospect to join me, promising them it would be amazing. The tasteless nectarine with honey caviar amuse bouche was indicative of the rest of the meal. They were out of the lobster carpaccio so we each had the herb salad because it was highly recommended by our server. The salad was pretty, that's about the only positive thing I can say. To be honest, it lacked acidity and the whey was completely flavorless. I also don't believe you should place foam on a dish unless it really adds to the flavor, which it clearly didn't. We decided to order one portion of the cauliflower soup, which turned out to be super delicious ... semi-rich and really well balanced. For my second course, I had the sweetbreads with lobster claw salad. Again, not too flavorful and unbalanced. The lavender pork belly and loin I had for my third course was edible, at least most of it. Half of the medallion was completely red so I didn't touch it and decided to only eat the edges. Call me unsophisticated if you want but pork that rare .... no gracias! And what's with the dried up puree and crunchy-chewy barley, which tasted like burnt rice? Finally, my chocolate truffle cake was delicious, but it was the size of a tiny brownie that was cut in half diagonally. PRICE: I had thought to myself, four courses for $48 ... wow! Well, when they say scallop on the menu, they literally mean that you get one scallop. That analogy goes for almost everything on the menu, so don't get too excited.. SERVICE: Our attractive hipster server was nice enough, even though his recommendations were a clear miss on every instance. Aside from that, the service was consistent. CONCLUSION: Is there something I just didn't get, fellow Yelpers?! The concept is over-developed but under-executed and the food not as refined as one is led to believe. However, if you must go I highly recommend ordering a bottle of the Lucien Albrecht Cremant d'Alsace Rose, as it was the most delicious thing I consumed that evening., Recommend, and hope to help this place develop a Yelp! following, as it definitely deserves it. Give it a try for your next special occasion -- perhaps in lieu of the much-hyped Frances -- I promise you won't be disappointed.It feels a little funny to be handing out a 5-star review, but the truth is I can't think of a single thing I'd have changed about our meal at this lovely new discovery. They are attentive to detail, inventive but well-edited, ambitious but unpretentious, and every aspect of the restaurant, from decor to food to service, reflects an eagerness to please. Though a stranger, I felt like I'd wandered into my favorite neighborhood bistro and they were serving my favorite dishes. We showed up a little late for our reservation and rather than making us stand awkwardly in the vestibule or next to the door getting elbowed by patrons, they seated us in their low-lit and cozy lounge at the back where we ordered a glass of wine and waited (not very long) for our table. We started with some buttery kumamotos with celery juice and a mild horseradish garnish, and went with the $48 four course menu. Cream of beet soup the color and texture of purple crushed velvet topped with tender small chunks of beet and topped with creme fraiche; gamey oxtail tartare with miso, chervil, juniper berry & potato chip; delectable seared foie with sweet grape granite, tart concord grapes, and yogurt; tender sweetbreads interestingly accompanied by somewhat salty dungeness crab meat and a pleasant dijon dressing; a gorgeous duo of crisp-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside sage pork belly and tender pork loin; a pretty good but not stellar squab breast with maitake mushrooms; and one of the best panna cottas I have ever had -- topped by a razor thin layer of incredibly subtle lemon verbena gelee, and filled with plump blueberries.The decor -- dark wood, vintage-looking crystal chandeliers, Fortessa flatware -- and service, from an open though somewhat out-of-view kitchen, are engineered to create a sense of ease and comfort. Probably the closest thing to a real French bistro experience I've had in this city so far.With four courses each, six oysters, three glasses of wine, tax, and a generous (deserved) tip, it came to $200.00 for two, which felt like fair value.I'd love to try it again as soon as the menu changes., MY GOD, this place was amazing. we got there early so we had almost personal service, and somehow our waiter managed to keep up that quality service even as the restaurant filled up. i forget his name, but he was AMAZING, best service i think i've ever had. very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the food. the three of us (my boyfriend sam, friend annie, and i) all had the really reasonably priced 4-course dinner, and my bf let our waiter pick his selections and man, his choices were spot-on.first things first: the food, oh my god, the FOOD. i'm going to have dreams about that cream of beet soup with crd2me fradcche. perfectly seasoned soup, warm, even the crd2me fradcche was deliciously seasoned. the people writing reviews saying the food was bland or seasoned poorly must over-salt everything and have burnt off their tastebuds, seriously. my bf and annie had the oxtail tartare and loved it. excellent presentation with the tartare. next annie and i had the sweetbreads (i've always been terrified of sweetbreads, but i gave it a go and actually quite liked it) and dijon foam and crab. the crab was GREAT. sam had the foie gras, which was divinely rich and buttery. then i had the squab breast with the confit leg (cute little foot still attached, eek) and sam and annie had the pork belly and tenderloin. only thing i would've changed about the meal would've been to get that as well. the squab was great, but the tenderloin was HEAVENLY. and then for dessert, we all had the vanilla panna cotta, which was the perfect ending to the meal. oh, and before we had the first course we were brought a little tasting, a little slice of cucumber topped w/ honey orbs (kind of like roe) and i think maybe some basil? anyway, delicious, great flavors and texture combos.secondly, the atmosphere. really well done. might've felt stuffy if they weren't playing the smiths and bowie and stuff, it was really great.thirdly...what i'm trying to say is, GO HERE BEFORE THEY RAISE THEIR PRICES AND/OR IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A RESERVATION., 'Sick. This place was ridiculous. Excellent menu, excellent wine pairings, attentive (but not oppressive) service. There was a seared foie gras and concord grape granita that may, or may not have, changed my life. Will be back for sure.', 'I had a very nice evening out with a dear friend here recently and I have to say I wasn that impressed. Don get me wrong there were some lovely things about the place ( the beet soup was amazing) but I just didn leave there wowed! Our waiter was very nice and tolerant of my friend and I so I think Il try it one more time.', 'Great dining experience....Sons & Daughters has that innovative, young spark with passion in every dish. Plates were small but flavors were robust and creative! The tasting menu is the way to go. We also added a few dishes a la carte. YUM - Sweetbreads, Seared foie, Squab breast, Pork Belly! Good -- Herb salad Pass -- Pasta with bone marrow powder My taste buds left happy and yours will too :)', I had been to S&D a couple of times before and it was quite good. The staff were friendly and kudos to them for converting the old, dated Cafd9 Mozart into a slick, but inviting space. But my third time was no charm. The evening really began with a tray-full of drinks that landed on my shoulder so perfectly that I was thoroughly soaked with a combination of white wine, champagne, some sticky drink. I know it was sticky since I had to retreat to the back of the restaurant to disrobe and wring out my shirt. To their credit, I was offered (and accepted) a staffer's shirt to return to the dinning table. While accidents happen and life is life, the kicker for me was when a staffer wanted to open a window with a long stick just over our heads. Rather than risk a being brained with a six-foot long fire iron (and with the drink experience fresh in people's minds), my companions fled the table while the staffer flailed about with the stick until finally giving up. Smelling like a wino, I couldn't really get in interested in the food, which my companions roundly trounced. We'll need some time to recover before returning to S&D., This place is very cute, it definitely has character of a trendy new place, open kitchen, very nice waiters but a few things just lacked on both service and food side for me. With using these types of preparations, I would have enjoyed explanations from our waiter on how things were prepared and unique. Some dishes had the foam that stood out but besides that it was hard to tell.Usually we're the ones that order less food and stay away from Pris fix menus and leave some on our plates but here we were just hungry and wanting more. The plates are very small tasting portions and even the entree selections are small, to the point of you really just get 3 bites and it's gone. For the price this just didn't seem worth it, a $24 lamb dish needs to have a bit more dish to it.We began with ala carte selections and ended up getting the tasting menu to satisfy our appetite yet I was still wanting more. The food is definitely fresh but not overly rich, everything felt light and preparation was for the most part well executed.Some things that stood out was the sweetbreads and arctic char tartar, the flavors were balanced, unique and exceptionally well blended together. Every bite was amazing and left you wanting more.The salad, lamb, and risotto was just OK as far as we were concerned. There was nothing special here, no bold or unique flavors. The salad was too acidic for my taste, the risotto was a bit on the watery side and the squash in it was chunky and didn't complement the texture but fought it. The finale was a chocolate cake with mint ice cream and coffee. The cake was dry and poorly made, it tasted like something out of a box. The ice cream was amazing, home made and you really tasted the fresh mint. The coffee was served in mugs, I found this completely lacking in class and ambiance for this place, I would have also enjoyed a nice espresso if they had a machine. Some dishes were good and some completely missed the mark for me and with the prices, I feel I could go to many other places and walk away more satisfied and impressed., 'Great cool update of a space that had lost it luster by an obviously creative team with a DESIGN CONCEPT at the forefront of what it wants the experience to be. Service was attentive, black clad servers in keeping with the vibe of the place, music..., hey it up to them but found the rock a billy not really working with the chill style of the dining room. When going to a restaurant wee usually ultimately seeking a meal. This experience was more of a high minded food as art presentation from newly graduated (top in their class) culinary students with money. Don get me wrong, creativity and fine ingredients were in evidence throughout but if you have an appetite and don wish to seek the remainder of your meal elsewhere after the very delicate courses presented fail to fully satisfy your hunger save this for a day youe looking for something out of the ordinary, perhaps not a meal, but involving food.', 'The waiter told us a cute story about how the two young chefs met in culinary school and started this place. Sounds like the trailer for the sequel to The Social Network. Except without the billion-dollar valuation, the lawsuits, and ... the success?Look, I hate to give an ambitious new place two stars. I try to find any reason not to go to this level. But seriously, Ie eaten at damned near every fine dining joint in town, multiple times, and I can say with absolute certainty this one won last without making serious adjustments, and soon.The food starts with nicely made brioche and salted butter. Cheers.Then there a bland honey balls amuse-bouche. It just sad. Ie never had an amuse-bouche that skimpy or sad anywhere. Your use of sodium alginate and calcium chloride (note to foodies: both chemicals) doesn make up for the fact that it just boring little honey balls.I had the herb salad. Note that I didn actually ORDER the herb salad, but that not why I am giving them such a low rating. I a good sport and miscommunication happens. It nicely seasoned and dressed, fresh, but there something (whey?) that has the very unpleasant texture of stale grape nuts. Get rid of it, and fast.The sweet breads with lobster claw is the high point of the meal. Nicely cooked but somewhat under-seasoned sweetbreads, forgettable chickpea puree, nice jus, nasty-looking and useless dijon foam. Over-seasoned lobster in little bits underneath a perfunctory baby greens salad. But overall, well made, tasty. Hits the right notes. Then the lamb. Look, this is a sad dish. I took one look at it when they set it down and I knew I wouldn like it. And I didn. It pitiful.It four little slices of lamb loin. They are perfectly even all the way through with a little crust. There is no jus, no fat, nothing to make the dish unctuous or rich. There are a few fried potatoes with roasted tomatillo sauce, and some odd green (cloves?) strewn about.Look, this is what the cooks did. They took this great piece of lamb, hacked every bit of fat off it, then stuck it in a sous vide machine. When the ticket was fired, they took it out, fried some potatoes, seared off the lamb, and dressed it with some pre-made tomatillo sauce.This is an insult to lamb. You can serve lamb without any rendered fat, no jus, in tiny little pieces like that. Guys. Go to any other restaurant in town serving lamb at similar prices to yours, and try it. Go to Frances. Go to Aziza. Go anywhere. Taste it and tell me it not an order of magnitude better. Yes, Thomas Keller gets away with serving perfect dishes with sous vide machines. Including lamb. You know what else he does? He spends twenty hours making triple veal stock to moisten it. You can serve a freakinlamb dish for over $20 with four little tiny pieces and no sauce or rendered fat. It insulting.Then there this sweet amuse bouche with berries and vanilla powder. It tastes like something at the condiments stand in Starbucks. I could make a ghetto latte with their vanilla powder.*calms down*The watermelon granita dessert was the best thing I had. Nice balance of melon and syrup. In a four course meal, the granita should NOT be the best thing I try.Seriously, the folks giving you three stars here are being nice. Each one is really thinking meh. If you get a Michelin star for this food, Il never trust the guide again. Il swear off the Bible and wander the desert, damn it. For around $90 after taxes, tips, food, wine, there no way this meal is even close to worthwhile, not at this level, no way.', 'The chefs (we noted two in the center kitchen) at Sons and Daughters are passionate about their work, of that there is little doubt. They have yet to combine their talents with the dining experience, however, which created a general feeling of dissatisfaction for me and my guests. Gluttonous typical American portions aside, $14 for one scallop borders on the ridiculous, no matter how expertly prepared. As far as touting the deal of the tasting menu, at $48 each plus wine and tip, the total hovers around $90 per person, depending on the wine selected. If that is a deal to you, knock yourself out. (Note: the dining menu is very small itself, by the way, so unless you eat everything, you may find picking all four courses a challenge.) Our server, while very nice, couldn elaborate on the bottle of wine we chose not because it was awful, but because the varietal asn her thing That is not a good enough answer if I forking over almost $100 per person.Overall, the experience reminded us of the esoteric dining of the late 90 that offered affected, labor-intensive food at a premium back when everybody was making money- just without the polished surroundings and stunning execution. If you are a member of the foodie/chef set and have a bunch of recreational cash lying around, you might like this place for the novelty. If not, you may be disappointed.', 'Alright, but not memorable.I admit I arrived here with high expectations, after reading a local food critic review, but mostly because one of the chefs used to work at Gregoire, one of my favorite sandwich places! (Go there now.) I certainly wish this place well, and all, but after sampling dishes that left the food critic in a state of bliss, I only thought they tasted okay. Okay isn necessarily a bad thing, and they are trying to be pretty creative in the kitchen, which is nice, but nothing was a standout. This place is not ready for the 100 things to eat before you die list.', 'So I had a most excellent experience here, but that said, I don think it for everyone.Here the way to get the most out of it.Go online. Look at the menu. Youl see it a really tight offering of dishes. If the majority of them sound delicious to you, make a reservation.Expect to spend about $80-90pp including drinks and tip.Order the $48 4-course prix fixe. Have at least one in your party do the same and share all of the plates. Order a bottle of wine. Or get the pairing for $35.What we loved: the atmosphere (lots of black and chandeliers, like an elegant home, but one that you could go to in nice jeans), the presentation (very upscale, interesting ingredients), the service (very helpful, knowledgeable). The 2 courses of amuse-bouche: 1 at the beginning of the meal, one before dessert.What we ate: the oysters, foie gras, char tartare, herb salad, sweetbreads, lamb, squab, risotto, and 2 desserts: chocolate cake and a watermelon granita. All were delicious - with the must-haves being the oysters, foie gras, herb salad, and squab.The portions are reasonable size, not huge, which is why it makes sense to try every dish that you can.Who would like it here: A date, New Yorkers, friends who are really into food.It has all of the makings of a cult-classic, hidden gem, and is a great addition to the area.', 'Looking around the dining room at Sons and Daughters, I felt like I had left San Francisco. Brussels? my companion suggested, but no, the room felt American in that East-Coast way of wishing it were Europe. The food is very careful--bordering on fussy--and I detected a certain cautiousness underlying the generally inventive and technical approach to cooking. I mean, they had foams and powders and all that, but the two main courses were just meat and two veg with jus (squab with pea shoots and green beans on the one hand and lamb with mashed potato and clover leaves on the other). They were just too similar and too safe. In the end, Sons and Daughters reminds me of Boston: I can appreciate it, but it not for me.', 'Fun tasting menu! Balanced flavors, beautifully prepared dishes... I loved everything from the brioche to the sweetbreads and lobster to the squab to chocolate brownie with mint ice cream at the end. Delicious! I would have licked the plate if it were socially acceptable. Will definitely be back and bringing all my friends.', Great new place near Union Square. When we walked in, a few in our party had already arrived and were seated in the waiting room, which is this cozy area in the back. The restaurant is intimate and nicely decorated. The execution and presentation of the dishes are on par with some of the more expensive restaurants in town but the tasting menu (choose 4 items for $48) was a fantastic deal.My selections:- Herb Salad with eucalyptus, curds, whey & quinoa. Absolutely loved this salad. Very interesting mix of complex flavors. Also, the presentation is great with delicate slices of greens, foam and sauces. Favorite dish of the night.- Foie gras with an accompanying yogurt & concord grape granite in a glass. The foie gras is seared and not a pate, which I prefer but it was still really good. Loved the granite as it provided a delicately sweet balance to the rich and savory foie gras.- Lamb loin served with redwood clovers with separate sauces of parsley, uni and tomatillo. The lamb was perfectly cooked and so tender (no chewiness at all). - Watermelon icee with compressed melons and basil. Nice refreshing and simple dessert to clean your palatte.A few in the party were left a little hungry as the dishes are on the smaller side. But I was nicely satiated (probably b/c I also had two of the amazingly warm pieces of bread). We had several bottles of the 2008 Chateau Musar Jeune, a blend of Cinsault, Syrah and Cab from Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, which I really enjoyed. A soft red that complemented the dishes well without overpowering., Sons and Daughters: Our party of six shared everything on the $48 tasting menu and the paired wines. We were impressed. The wines were well chosen; the foie torchon (a cylinder of creamy foie gras) went spectacularly well with the slightly sweet gewd_rztraminer (an alternative to the traditional sauterne). The lobster carpaccio, scallops, lamb, squab and sweetbreads were all perfectly executed. In between there were little spoonfuls of savory things with interesting textures. I thought the chocolate cake a bit dry but my friends disagreed. The series of good things in small portions added up to just the right amount of food and the price was a bargain for such quality and creativity. The chefs looked very young (and the somellier even younger!) but they definitely know what they're doing., 'my friend and i both had the four course tasting - her with the wine. we ordered different items so we could taste everything.started with the honey balls amuse bouche and it was tasty. by the way, the bread and butter is delicious - almost like corn bread. the chef gave us each a complimentary bowl of beet soup so our four courses became five. the soup was an amazing magenta and tasty. i had the salad, which was fresh and delicious. then the carrots with vanilla puree were yummy. next was the squab which also was very good, but the foot still on was a little off putting to me. for dessert (after the blueberry and coconut powder amuse bouche) was the chocolate cake with mint ice cream. refreshing and decadent.my friend was a fan of all the wine pairings while i sipped a few glasses of persecco. all in all it was a little expensive, but we really enjoyed ourselves and left very full.', I found this place on yelp during a trip to San Francisco. It's new and pretty understated from the outside, but i love the interior decor. it's pretty swanky and small, kind of what i expect from SF or NYC. we came in for the pre fixe 4 course meal, and it was about $75 per person including wine.we started off with a flaky, soft, and warm brioche that had just the right amount of sweetness. i had to force myself to stop eating to save stomach space. we were given a complimentary sample of cucumber caviar which was very fresh and had great flavor. my starter course was the beet cream soup with creme fraiche. it was absolutely amazing and comfy, one of those soups you wish you could buy in bulk to have at home on a cold, rainy day. this was my favorite dish of all. we also got the sweetbread with lobster which was buttery and soft. the foam stuff was just weird, i really don't get why it's included in dishes. the lobster was great thought, not too tough. i got the zucchini and squash risotto which was really light and delicious with goats milk cheese on top. i could barely finish it all. my friends got the lamb, and it was cooked perfectly. for dessert, we had chocolate truffle cake with mint ice cream and pistachio that tasted like frozen herbs. we also got another complimentary sample of fresh blueberries with cream and coffee. Yum. the incredibly slow service pushes this to a solid 4, but overall the cuisine is perfectly aligned to a foodie's palate and heart!, eh. it's ok. i left hungry. wasn't wowed by any of their dishes, though the presentation and space are impressive., Ambitious chefs cooking creatively, mixing it up. Local, organic ingredients combined in interesting and mostly tasty ways, but not all dishes were successful. And it's pretty spendy, too., Finally got to try this place out. I thought the menu looked so interesting and really wanted to like it. Their concept seemed new and different. Unfortunately, when I did finally taste the food, the execution was just a little off. Between the two of us, I got to try 8 courses and I can't say any of them was memorable. The squab was pretty good, but I flat out just did not like the taste of the yogurt with the seared foie. Nothing was horrible, but it lacked the wow factor for me. It was just kind of A-Ok as the 3 stars say., Solid four stars. Ate here for the first time with a foodie friend - we were really looking forward to trying this place out. Highly recommend doing the 4 course tasting with accompanying wine selections. Let them figure it out for you. End up with a prix fix of $99.10. Tip and you are out of there for about $120 per person. The portions are small - however they are plenty when you figure a warm fresh roll and the wines. I had: Herb salad with eucalyptus, curds and quinoa and fennel. Loved it - but couldn't detect any menthol hints at all so wondered where the eucalyptus came into play. The fois is to die for good. Lightly dusted in flour and sauteed it had a caramelized crunch. I enjoyed it by dipping my spoon into the yogurt and grape granite and then adding a slice of the fois. I am not a fan of eating just fois - I need it on a raft of some sort - but this was refreshingly different and I didn't miss my requisite raft. MMMMMM.... I then had the squab - it was a tad underdone for my taste and slightly challenging to eat. though presentation was magnificent and daring with the little claw foot sticking up ever so slightly. :) Do not miss the watermelon granite - over the top refreshing. A cup of french press coffee in a diner mug and stick a fork in you are done. My companion enjoyed the ahi with quail egg. she said it was delicious. She also had the lamb - she didn't rave about it but she did say she would go back. I would too when they change the menu. Although I enjoyed the limited selection prepared flawlessly and I get the mindset around that - I hope they change weekly or bi-weekly so I have a really good reason to go back soon., 'Sons & Daughters provided me with one of my most memorable meals out in SF for a long while - surprising me with fresh ingredients, inspired dishes, and flawless execution. The 4-course tasting menu with its exceptional wine pairing is the way to go, giving you the chance to explore all the kitchen has to offer.The chefs dabble in molecular gastronomy and have a few creative flavor combinations (like the seared foie gras with yogurt, concord grape granite, and balsamic foam), but mainly Sons & Daughters impresses with its thoughtful food choice and precise execution. Squab breast is accompanied by a delightfully sweet pea coulis; instead of salad, they pair lamb loin with the much more unusual, grassy flavor of redwood clover leaves. Even their bread rolls are delicious, well-seasoned with San Francisco sea salt and served with warmed butter. Other nice touches include two complimentary amuse bouches and glasses of prosecco with the wine pairing.With chandeliers and fine art photos adorning the black walls, the ambiance manages to feel upscale without being pretentious. This is probably enhanced by the relaxed (yet still classy) service and open-air kitchen, allowing diners a sneak peak at the chefs at work.At $48 for the tasting menu and another $36 for the wine pairing, I would describe the meal as pricey but not overpriced - they are, after all, serving lobster, foie gras, and lamb. For a special occasion or simply a nice evening out, Sons & Daughters will leave your curiosity piqued and your palate satisfied.', I was certainly excited to come to S&D after hearing so much buzz about it. Unfortunately, I didn't think the experience lived up to the buzz. There were certainly highlights during the evening - the cream of beet soup was wonderful and fresh, and the desserts were superb. However, I found the vegetable and the meat courses to be flat. Although my lamb was very well cooked, it lacked flavor and tasted like....lamb. I knew it wasn't just me since everyone else at the table that ordered lamb also asked for salt. The arctic char tartar was just so-so. The sweetbread was a bit chewy and overdone. Some of the dishes just seemed a bit overworked and complicated.Service throughout the evening was very good, but did not make up for the average food we got. I definitely believe S&D has potential, but given the price we paid, I also think we could've gotten better food elsewhere., Seriously awesome. Best date place I can recommend if you are ok with the price. We did the 4 courses with the pairing and the food was exquisite, perfectly portioned... I had beet bisque for the first time and it was phenomenal. The service was outstanding, great attention to detail, they explained every dish and how to enjoy it, explained every wine, refilled our water, didn't charge for the after dinner coffee, and generally went out of their way to accommodate us. We both ordered different things and everything was done just right and if you are vegetarian I think each course had a non-meat option.Minus a star b'cause neither of us liked our dessert, since everything else was fabulous that may have just been us., 'Just want to write this to help the owners out. Got the prix fixe which seemed like a good deal. Portions were so small, I not a big eater but I was still hungry and went out to eat again afterwards. Service was my biggest problem, I actually overhead one server say to another, man wee only doing 15 covers tonight, I need to make some money! Also, not ONCE did server check back on one of our courses to see how we liked it. I didn touch my foie gras since it was really undercooked, the server who took it away didn even ask if anything was wrong. Both amuses were warm (on a really hot day) and neither added anything to the experience except to take away from it. I liked the menu and the concept but this place needs a lot of work, please hire servers who at least pretend to care.', 'Excellent meal and excellent service for this tiny place. Wonderful pairing of wine with the 4 course special. i will return.', '3.5 fairly priced: 4 course $48interior is nice, simple, esp. with the black and chandeliers3 choices each course and with choices like sweetbreads or foie, it kind of a more advanced dining menuour choices:amuse bouche: honey ballsbread on a hot plate, biscuit-likecourse 1*beet soup marjoram creme fraiche -- nice color, strong beet flavor, great mix with creme fraiche*raw scallop nasturtium flower lime basil horseradish -- single thin scallop, too flowery on top but scallop was decent qualitycourse 2*seared foie concord grape granite with balsamic foam -- wasn a fan, large piece of foie seared properly but salted (too much) with a sweet granita and foam, but missed a carb component, plus piece too large for combo of ingredients*gnocchi white chanterelles corn arugula sage nasturtium petal -- gnocchi not super melty, but all the ingredients fine, nice corncourse 3*sablefish tomatoes consomme pepper kelp sea salt foam -- mild flavor, prepared well, pepper helped*squab breast confit leg baby carrots pea coulis -- prepared quite well, was slightly gamey but otherwise perfect skin flavordessert amuse bouche: strawberry and vanilla powdercourse 4*super weak, vanilla panna cotta white peach lemon verbena*also weak presentation chocolate truffle cake mint ice cream pistachio -- cake was the good partwhere the pastry chef when you need one', We really enjoyed our first visit to Sons & Daughters. We both had the 4-course menu, fairly priced at $48. The winelist was interesting but fairly small. Since nothing jumped out at us, we had the wine pairing as well for $36.What I had: Scallop crudo - very very nice. prepared with lime, herbs, and nurstatium (sp?) petals, which was very interesting with the scallops. Paired with a Loire chenin blanc. Sweetbread and lobster salad - I thought this was the weakest course. the lobster salad was nice, but the sweetbread was somewhat tasteless. Paired with a Viognier Squab - Delicious! Perfectly prepared. The chestnut puree was wonderful. Paired with an Oregon Pinot. Cheese - 2 small cheeses. Excellent grilled bread. Interestingly, paired with a white wine (don't remember what it was).Services was friendly, efficiency, and knowledgeable. Only small criticism would be that the wine didn't always arrive before or with the course. But that's a small quibble.|1
47|soto-new-york|Checked this out yesterday with some friends, We had plenty of food to try out, pretty much the entire menu. Food was good, thou couldn't take another bite, the fresh coat of paint still fume the place. Long story short.Food - *****Service - *****Decor - ****Up to Par - ******Yo B - Thanks 4 Evite, everyone had a great time. We all are proud :o)P.S.The belly rules the mind. Catch u later, I had high hopes for Soto. Supposedly, the chef (Soto Kosugi) is a legend in Atlanta (not that Atlanta is the hotbed for sushi or anything) and there's been quite a bit of buzz for this place... spotlighted on Zagat's site, featured in various blogs, and written up by critics in local publications. Despite all this, I was rather surprised when I was able to score 8:30pm reservations on the same day (week night). I walked in and the minimalist, clean simple wood interior reminded me a bit of Momofuku and Sushi Yasuda. But that's where the comparison should stop (Yasuda is on a different level and thus, I won't even go there w/ comparing the two). Soto has a nice clean interior but they need to tone down the lighting... the halogen bulbs were beyond bright... I don't need romantic mood lighting in here but I don't want to feel like I'm in a hospital room.As for the food, we opted for a variety of dishes (primarily non-sushi) to sample. Some of the dishes will remind you of Nobu... inventive and interesting, great use of fresh seafood, and nice presentation. We ordered two different lobster dishes (a special lobster roll of the day and the amazing cold steamed lobster layered with uni and garnished with caviar on a bed of cucumbers... i can't imagine lobster being prepared any better than this). The lobster dishes were definitely the highlight of night. I would've been a happy camper had I stuck with those since I was underwhelmed by the other dishes. The citrus salmon carpaccio was perfectly edible but boring, the chawan-mushi was good but I've had much better, and the anago dish was completely forgettable. I was also disappointed that they were out of the fluke dish and that my companion did not care to try the langostine dish, which sounded amazing on the menu.Service was definitely lacking. Dishes were oddly timed... one dish, then a long wait til the next, then everything else all at once. Our poor waiter, a fresh-faced young guy who probably just started there, was a mess. He spilled a few times at our table and also continued about his clumsy / nervous ways at the table next to ours. My date was getting totally aggravated with him and wanted to say something, but I convinced him that he's a cute kid, seems to be trying his best, and deserves a break. Hope he's getting along better these days.... Love the fact that it is BYOB (for now)... I brought a bottle of sake which they chilled in the back and brought it back in a cool blue carafe to serve. I hope to be able to up my rating to 4 stars for Soto (5 will be ambitious); thus, I'll give them some time to work out their kinks and plan on going back... esp so I can order the omakase and try the sushi / sashimi... oh, more lobster please!, Fancy presentation, casual atmosphere. Uni and lobster dishes are superb. Service is a bit slow but they try.There's no sign outside the restaurant so you would need to look out for the minimalist, white wall in a glass-fronted space with cutouts that let you peek into the restaurant...kinda like it's framing up its customers.There's no omakase yet. Portions are very small so sharing is probably the best way to go in order to enjoy the various dishes.The lobster with uni was really well made. Presentation was very fine. The lobster was prepared such that it was still very tender and sweet. Excellent combination of flavors.Uni with black sesame yuba was interesting and so good. The slightly thick and more rubbery texture of the yuba somehow went so well with the creamy, sweet and delicate texture of the very fresh uni...actually, on second thoughts, perhaps the yuba could be slightly thinner, but nevertheless, I really liked the overall taste.Langoustines were yum, although they reminded me of those scallop/crab-baked-with-Japanese-mayo dishes you find at more casual Japanese restaurants. Doesn't mean they can't serve that here though. What stood out was that in spite of the gratinating of the mayo/mushroom topping on the halved langoustine shells, the langoustine meat still managed to be really soft.Goma tofu was very tasty. It was cubes of white sesame and black sesame-flavored tofu. It had the perfect creamy consistency with just that touch of texture from the sesame....really opened up the palate as a starter.Geoduck clam appetizer was great. The geoduck was not rubbery at all...had a texture of very soft clamari/squid. Presentation was really cute with the carved fresh lime...but it lent a latin flavor to the look of the dish.Uni and unagi was not bad but not as amazing. It was unagi smeared with uni on top and then grilled. The presentation was excellent but the unagi was a bit dry for my liking.Tuna avocado roll wrapped in white kelp was interesting and pretty good. The filling was raw tuna mixed with pine nuts (nice touch) and some pieces of avocado in a roll.There was quite a wide/interesting variety of fish for sushi and sashimi. White shrimp is good. Medai (bream) I didn't get to try but I don't often find that.Not many options for desserts, they only have a variety of mochi ice cream (strawberry, mango, red bean, green tea and vanilla). We ordered 1 of each and they were nice enough to slice each in half and still had them nicely garnished on a plate for us to share.The service of the food was very slow but our waitress was really pleasant and nice about everything. A bit too many plate-changing though.Decor inside is very clean, elegant and yet also casual, felt like you were in someone's new apartment. What really caught my attention was the detail they had in their presentation, very modern but still very precise and delicate. Prices are very reasonable, 14 dishes + 2 bottles of sake + 7 pieces of sushi + 2 rolls + mochi divided by 8 = reasonable fullness and $64 per person including tax and tip., 'I guess this place hasn been open for too long. When I decided to dine there 2 weeks ago, there wasn even a sign outside the restaurant. I assume it will stay this way since Soto wants to give patrons a sense of mystery and anticipation upon entering, but don be fooled - the interior is bright, simple, and minimalistic - hardly an ideal choice for a romantic/intimate occasion. The menu prices are ridiculously high for the portion sizes. I spent about $140 for 2 (no wine) and had a selection of appetizers, mains, and ala carte sushi. Every dish is meticulously prepared and neatly presented, though this is precisely what I felt I was paying for. Nothing really stood out apart from the lobster sashimi ($18), which in all honestly, doesn take a genius to prepare.I was only half-full after this experience and will definitely avoid this restaurant in future. Soto Sushi is without a doubt a popular place among the mostly American clientele who are deluded by the high pricing, the branding of this establishment, and the apparent celebrity status of the chef/owner (I did not know about this until later). Whoever claims that this is the best Japanese cuisine in town is clearly oblivious to the numerous other places in Manhattan that serve comparable food at a fraction of the price.You have been warned.', I came here in May right after they opened and it was still BYOB, pretty empty and the food was EXCELLENT. We ordered all the specials on the menu, 2 special rolls and a Flounder. The person I was with was a bit hesitant because it was an entire fish but once she had a taste she forgot that very quickly. : )2008 Update: came back here again and LOVED it! It is more like a tapas type Japanese bar, not somewhere to go when you're super hungry and want to fill up. Three of us shared 2 entrees and 2 sushi rolls. We had a soft shelled crab and amazing lobster with mango and portobello mushrooms. The sushi first roll was just a simple scallop roll with a hint of mint and their roll of the day of tuna tar tar. We were very satisfied when the meal was over. Along with two drinks the total bill was a little over $80 but worth every penny., EXCELLENT excellent food. soto is and wonderful sushi chef and the kitchen dishes were wonderful as well. fish is flavorful and fresh, and the menu is updated everyday(guess they get shipments of fish daily?) the only thing that was dissapointing was the atmosphere. i sat with a friend at a table by the sushi bar but next time i'm gonna def sit at the bar. service was really nice too. very attentive., Soto has excellent sushi. However, their hot and cold dishes are the true standouts. In fact, they are probably the most creative and moan-inducing dishes I have had at any restaurant in the last year. If you are an uni lover, you will be in heaven. The most gorgeously plated dish (and also my favorite, taste-wise) was uni surrounded by squid and seaweed and topped with a quail egg. The lobster, uni and lotus root dish was also extremely delicious and delicate. The sushi was very good, but I have had better and I think it is a little overpriced for what it is. IMO, an order of 2 cold dishes, 2 hot dishes and 3 pieces of sushi is ideal for one person. This is what I had and I spent $150 after tax and tip, with no alcohol. Pricey, but the dishes are so artful and unique that it is worth it. This wouldn't be my first choice if I was in the mood for just sushi and sashimi, but I can't wait to go back and try the other dishes I missed!, Uni lovers rejoice! Soto gives you many options to choose from with the sweet, smooth see urchin, and gives you generous portions of them! One of my favorite dishes of the night was the mountain of uni wrapped in seaweed and sweet and chewy squid, topped with a raw quail egg. When you mix it all together, you get a deliciously creamy combination!With shipments of fresh fish coming in from Japan every four days and fresh shipments from everywhere else (US, New Zealand, etc) arriving every day, they never run out of any of their unique seafood...including the wierd-sounding but wonderfully tasty squid with quail egg and sea cucumber intestine. I was a little hesitant to try it at first but after the first bite, I was hooked! It has the wonderful fresh taste of the sea, with an interesting texture combination: chewy, but also smooth and slightly slimy.Soto definitely offers dishes you won't find just anywhere, from monkfish liver to cod fish milt, but you should trust the chef. In fact, I found that the stranger dishes were the best. Lobster sashimi, while fresh and sweet, was not particularly memorable, and neither was any other sashimi dish I had, although they weren't bad, but it was the strange choices that really stood out., 'I first came here a year ago when they opened. At the time, they were BYOS (Bring Your Own Sake), and they were still experiencing some growing pains. I ordered a couple entrees, including the uni wrapped in squid with quail egg, the broiled langoustines, and a ton of sushi (via the omakase). I remember the entrees being excellent, and the sushi being pretty good, but not awesome. This time around, they have now acquired their liquor license, and they have a fairly good selection of sake, red wine, white wine, and beer. Heeding my lesson from the first time around, I asked the waiter if they had any omakase for the entrees. There a sushi omakase listed, but nothing on the menu for the main courses. The waiter said he would check with the chef, and the answer was in the affirmative. I thought they give me 4 or 5 dishes, but I ended up getting 11. This is what I ended up getting:- Edamame starter (bland - not special)- Chawan mushi (decent)- Surf clam with ginger (good, but not memorable)- Sesame tofu (better...)At this point, I was thinking that the meal was good, but nothing to write home (or on Yelp) about... but at this point, I feel, is when they must have started adding crack or something to all the dishes. In fact, this meal ended up being a mirror image of my meal at Per Se, which started off with 6 amazing, heavenly dishes, and then petered out. In the case of Soto, it started off slowly and then went to amazing. The mention of Per Se is not accidental. On to the final dishes. - Steamed tai, or sea bream, in ginger broth (amazing, though portions were small for $16 - the equivalent of two sashimi slices worth of fish)- Steamed Lobster with uni mousse (Wow!, the uni mixed into the lobster really created an amazing combo)- Scallop, Fluke, Shiso Agedashi (Wow again, this was like agedashi of, with fish replacing the tofu - it was extremely delicate, yet flavorful)- lobster sashimi (Simple, yet amazing as well)- Baked sea bass (a lot like the steamed tai, very flavorful but also rich)- Toro tartare (normally, this is a highlight of any meal, but in this case, it was merely great)- Fresh West Coast Sea urchin wrapped in thinly sliced squid and shiso (Many others list this as their favorite, but I think the combo doesn work for me personally - the squid does not mix well with the uni in terms of texture or flavor)- Broiled langoustine (Wow, the shrimp was sweet, and the sauce made out of its guts added just the right amount of intense flavor)At this point, Soto-san told me the omakase was over, and would I have any room for sushi? I was already bursting, but I nodded my assent. I received four pieces, and then waved my hands - the universal signal for No more!. For the sushi, I got shira ebi (white shrimp), chu-toro, hamachi, and anago. I calculated the cost of the separate dishes and the sushi, and I think I got about a 25% fixed price discount vs. the separate cost ($150 before tax and tip). However, if you don want to eat so much, I would recommend any of the dishes above starting at the steamed tai and thereafter. If I rated the restaurant based only on sushi, it be a 4 star. But the cold/hot entrees take it into the stratosphere - I have to agree with Kay in calling this moan-inducing. Absolutely one of the best meals Ie had in a while. Service was a bit slow at first (took a while to get the chawan mushi) but then the hits kept coming one after another. I will have to go back to Soto soon.', Very unique and tasty dishes define this simple, unassuming place. The food is just like Nobu's (in my opinion, much better and their dishes less overdone/overcopied): artistic, flavorful and very, very good. Definitely couple of things that make you go 'wow', and that's pretty rare.Be prepared to bring the checkbook because you're leaving hungry otherwise. I was in a group of 4 and lets just say 2-3 entrees/person and a tab of $200 left us all still pretty hungry and wanting more. You can easily spend $100/person on food here, no problem.Great service in a comfortable and very small scene. Should definitely try it out if you're a fan of the Nobus in this world, and see what you think. Too bad it's no longer BYO though!, 'The uni wrapped with thin slivers of squid, then strips of seaweed, topped with a quail egg - to resemble a real whole sea urchin - is worth the 5 stars alone! Lobster sashimi was a little overpowered by ginger sauce, but everything from the big eye tuna to the shiso wrapped agedashi of scallops and fluke, were plain delicious and almost too beautiful to eat!Kind of on the expensive side, it was a $100 per person which included a bottle of sake, and I was not completely full. Definitely request to sit at the bar, because watching the master work at his creations is well worth it! Also - go early, I went at 9pm and got the last piece of uni in the restaurant *yum*!', 'Another bad value proposition. We paid about $200 for two ppl (no drinks) and we were satisfied, but we could have easily eaten more. The food was good and is only described as exquisite because everything was just so small. For the celebrity chef factor, Soto does prepare a lot of the food himself and he seems like a very anal, exacting man, the kind that alphabetizes CD collection (or perhaps porn) by genre and then by artist. I find him a little scary. He was apparently a big deal in Atlanta, but I don think his restaurant is that wonderful in the land of awesome NY eats.The restaurant does have an obsession with uni - we tried 2 of the items with uni and found them pretty good. I liked the one with the quail egg on it the best because it was presented so nicely and the uni was very fresh.We also had the sushi omakase - 12 pieces of sushi, each one served on warm rice with very fresh fish. Great, but Soto specialty is more cooked dishes than sushi. I recommend ordering a variety of cold and hot dishes and perhaps skipping the sushi altogether.Service is very good. I probably wouldn come back until Ie tried some other places.', So if they simply opened in the Upper East Side instead, their clientele wouldn't have to travel so far.Lets think:FOOD: precise and beautiful food - couldn't fault it - though the price tag is heavy, and quite honestly not warranted. Increase the price, you increase the expectation - and frankly the food didn't come near expectation.DRINKS: fantastic wine and sake menu, well only if you want to drink by the bottle - otherwise 4 things by the glass is rather pathetic.ATMOSPHERE - minimalist, clean lines, bright (as in glaringly bright). If the lights were toned down by half to add a little warmth to this WeVil spot they might at least have a shot.UPSHOT - they won't last. It's overpriced, clearly not a local crowd, the room is lack-lustre and the food, while very good, lacks consistent wow-factor. I say Deathwatch - 18 months max., Oh, I love Soto! I'd been wanting to try it since I first read about it, when if opened in NY. Really cool, unique dishes on the menu, so many intriguing combinations of ingredients.We were celebrating, so we had a sparkling sake, which was great because it's sweet and sparkly, like a moscato, good for people who aren't usually huge fans of sake (like my bf). The Kompachi Tartare was a great start, wonderful flavors and a nice balance with the pine nuts. Next up was the Fluke Usuzukuri - loved the super thin slices of amazingly delicious fish, and the yuzu added a beautiful zing. The Shiro Ebi Tar Tare was great with the caviar and the ikura, and the broth under it was awesome. Finally, the Broiled Lobster With Mango, Portabella was such a fun dish - luscious lobster meat balanced with sweet mango and savory portabella, it was great getting all the flavors in each bite.Service was great and attentive without being overbearing, the dishes were spaced apart so that we could really savor and enjoy each dish separately. We were having a great time and great conversation, so the pacing was perfect. All in all, a great meal, we can't wait to find an excuse to go back., 'Hard to find, but once you do, youl find tasty treats inside. I heard so many good things about this place that I had to come and try for my wife birthday. Recommended by our burnt out, smoking too much weed waiter, we got 4 dishes to feast upon. One by one they came out and it was presented in a creative, yet delicate fashion of mostly uni. All the items were good and uni was sweet and fresh. Portions were waaay to small, but the taste made up for it. As we finished our langoustine, we ordered 3 sushi not realizing that one order of a specific type of sushi only came out as one piece....I thought this was a crock, but whatever. My wife was full, but I later got a pizza in my neighborhood.Food was good and worth the visit, but portions were small and a bit too pricey IMO. Il still give it a weak 4 stars and definitely eat something before you go to keep you satisfied.', 'Let me start by saying, I all about the Nigiri. I don like Maki places and 1000 things on the menu.- No sign / no menu on the window: This is always a great first impression for me. Very classy Japanese style. Great restaurants only need word-of-mouth advertising, and I like the confidence this place has in its food and service. - Awesome Awesome nigiri: this is what separates 4/5 stars with the rest. The chef (guy with glasses) is a REAL sushi chef as opposed to many other sushi places that really don know much about art of sushi-making. You should sit by the bar to observe him. He grabs a perfectly cooked rice (nice and moist w/ a bit of a bite) and molds it perfectly (not too compact) so the rice easily falls apart in your mouth. He takes time to cut a fresh piece of fish (chef and waiters are very knowledgeable on what the freshest and the best fish for that day) in ways to bring out the most complex flavors. Also, the piece is beautifully laid on top of rice. Some chefs, like this one, who want customers to eat the way they want customers to eat would put wasabi mixed soy sauce on the nigiri piece (some think it arrogance, but I personally don think so and don really care). Anyways, nigiri here is one of the finest.- Uni: I heard so many good things about Uni here and yes, it was the finest quality. Amy M. mentions uni/squid/chiso/quail egg small dish. It is superb. Get the Uni nigiri like I did...youl be so happy youl order another bottle of Sake.- Service: Excellent waiter service. He was very knowledgeable and helped us pick great dishes. Again, I feel good Japanese restaurant waiters should know what the freshest that day...Avoid places that say all our fishes are very fresh. It BS.- Fusion: some of the small plates were most fusion type of dishes than traditional. Interesting twist although I didn like all of them. However, if you are into trying new creative dishes like me, it always a pleasure. - Sake: I don know too much about Sake, but there was a good variety. My Tokyo friend who knows Sake said they had good selection, so you should take his word. - Price: Be ready to spend some of your hard-earned money on both sushi and a good bottle of sake. It worth it. Ignore people who paid less than $125 per person because it just silly to walk into a good sushi restaurant like this and expect to pay less. Hopefully, I didn sound like a douche bag.', 'Sotohiro Kosugi food has been a staple of my diet for many years. I frequented his restaurant(s) in Atlanta for many years. Needless to say, I was devastated when he left. As with Chefs Guenter Seeger and Joel Antunes, Soto just did not fit here in Atlanta. Soto is an artist, and that does not translate well to the Atlanta scene. Wee getting better, but wee just not there yet. While I will give this 5 stars all day, every day - it is not to say that Soto is absent of faults. I have ordered Omakase for years. As a frequent customer, I not sure Soto serves us the same thing he does most Omakase customers. This is most likely because he knows we eat everything - so there is no holds barred with us. Because of that, I will not steer anyone toward any particular dish. I will however, give a few suggestions and tips on what to expect. First: the portions are small. Second: it not inexpensive. Third: It not quick. If you can swallow those three things, then youl be in good shape. But if youe read this review and still complain about those.... well, I warned you. Ie heard people toss the words celebrity chef with Soto, and I must say I baffled by that. Celebrity chef makes me think of Gordon Ramsey, Nobu Matsuhisa, Tom Colicchio, or Daniel Boulud. I cannot think of a single instance of Soto doing an interview (outside of the culinary world) or promotional book tour, or anything of the sort (if I wrong - let me know). He is, however, distinctly Japanese. He can be abrasive and has a very demanding personality. This is not directed at his customer, rather, at his employees and most notably: HIMSELF. He works in front of his customers and should probably tone down the outbursts. When Soto is in a good mood, he is as friendly and as engaging as anyone. But he is such a perfectionist; if you don know how to read him - you may think he ignoring you. He is not; he is just focused on his craft. His wait staff is attentive and kind, so that should help soften some of the gruff from Soto. What he may be lacking in the warm and fuzzy aspect, he more than makes up for in his execution, delivery, and quality. The cooked dishes are wonderful and offer an excellent opportunity to explore your palette. As with any artist, presentation is as important as anything. Each plate comes with itsown masterpiece that you think must be one-of-a-kind. Then you glance at the plate of anyone else at the table and see that he executed a consistent presentation.The flavors are wonderful and he uses only the highest quality product. I would take every opportunity afforded and be adventurous here. You will not be disappointed. I find it hard to justify spending this kind of money on a spicy tuna roll (though it is wonderful here). If you go - expect a fine dining experience at itbest. It will be delicious and exquisite with a distinctly Japanese feel. Youl be there a while, so make sure you order enough; but, you will not be disappointed. To sum it up: FANTASTIC.', 'You know how you find an amazing restaurant, then go back and it meh? Not so with Soto. I keep coming back, determined to find fault, and there is none to be had. This is my favorite restaurant of 2008. Virtually every dish on the menu is delicious, and very thoughtfully prepared. We usually do a combination of the first page of the menu and the sashimi. Haven dabbled with the cooked fish entrees. A few menu recommendations:Chawan Mushi -- a traditional Japanese starter and prepared perfectly at Soto.Chyu Toro Tar Tare chopped fatty tuna with avocado coulis, garnished with caviar, chive, served in sesame ponzu sauce -- beautiful presentation, amazing flavors.Tempura -- okay... I am not a go-to-Japanese-restaurant-and-gorge-on-tempura gal, but this is some really special tempura. Unique veggies, perfectly fried. Opt for salt and lemon as garnish rather than the dipping sauce.Ume shiso rolls -- a very delicious burst of flavor and a perfect filler if you need it.Hakkaisan Junai Ginjo -- the perfect sake to complement sushi or sashimi.The few items we tried that weren mindblowing were worth trying once. So be adventurous! Opt for dessert elsewhere, though. Their mochi balls should be taken off the menu, really. I suggest walking to Chikalicious for a dessert conclusion worthy of such a fabulous meal partner. What else? Service is very attentive. Call for reservation and if they tell you they are booked, call back 5-10 mins before you plan to arrive; we have never had a problem getting a seat although it did require tenacity when we went on a whim. Bathroom is amusing with automatic everything.', Came by when it first opened. Interesting menu and we decided to go with the dobin mushi soup (oooh it had been a long time since I had this and was so delighted to see this on the menu), steamed lobster with uni mousse, tempura, scallop fluke agedashi, broiled langoustine (and many more dishes), chef's omakase sushi along with some lovely sake. Food was good but servings were small, which explained why we went on and on with the food order. BTW, the omakase sushi order was not planned. We just decided to go with that at the end of our 8 dishes for a group of 4. I guess I came here to be overwhelmed by a whole ton of uni dishes... but the uni-ness just didn't come through. I did however, love the otoro sushi... which I thought was AMAZING., Update. We went back recently and nothing was as good as it was the first time. The quality of the uni and toro was not as good, and all of the dishes were a step below what we had that first day. Unfortunately, the prices stayed the same. So we probably won't go back again unless something changes. Oh well., Really, Soto? $60 for sashimi Omakase that's barely appetizer-sized?I get it: Fancy sushi is pricey. And we're paying for presentation as well as taste. And yes, the sushi tasted great.But my friend and I spent $130 EACH and we left that restaurant still hungry. There has to be something wrong with that!We were so hungry after our $260 meal that we went to the noodle bar down the street and bought three orders of dumplings at $5 each. Next time we'll order the dumplings BEFORE the meal. Oh wait, there won't be a next time. We're in a recession now, my wallet just can't justify it., REALLY SMALL PORTIONS!!!!!! Smallest I've seen yet, I have to say. Nobu gives you more food! I've had way better sushi. The fried shrimp cakes barely had shrimp in there and it was overly greasy. The tuna tar tar was way too complex and the flavors did not mesh well. Pear, sesame oil, scallions.... where's the TUNA?!?! Can't remember the other dish but it was a semi-cooked fish sashimi style that had way too much soy sauce., Best sushi I've ever had in the lower 48, bar none. Incredible flavor, freshness and artistry. Incredibly. Tasty. That is all.Unlike some of the other reviewers, I was quite satisfied with the omakase portions. If you want a huge meal, go to the Cheesecake Factory or some other chain monument to American gastronomic excess., uni is my favorite food (it's even the wallpaper on my cellphone-one when it's still in the spiky shell. it keeps me full everytime i make a call). and soto serves it so well!uni-ika with soy reduction made me cry. so did the whole lobster tail sashimi topped w/ caviar.they also had THE most high-tech bathroom of all the fine restaurants i've been to: minimal, and yet EVERYTHING is automatic. we're all used to motion sensored faucets, toilets, soap and paper towel dispensers. with all of those Soto topped it off w/ a motion sensored trash can! sorry this paragraph already got way longer than the one describing their food, but i just can't stop telling everyone about their awesome trash can!if you like inventive and yet authentic sashimi dishes, go here. the bottom line is: Chica (the owner and chef of Chikalicious) recommended this place. and the night we went, she and her husband (sous chef at Chikalicious) were eating at the bar., 'This is my absolute favorite restaurant, and I never miss the opportunity to visit and indeed plan trips down to NYC specifically to eat here. Chef Soto is a perfectionist and a true master who operates with both fine cutting precision and extreme creativity. I am on my most respectful behavior when sitting at his sushi bar. He is intense and extremely focused on his work, but also has a warm and humorous side. On one occassion Chef Soto apologized profusedly to me, for being able to only offer B++ quality uni (only a perfectionist would know and admit to the difference) and made me a complimentary geoduck clam sald because of this. As someone who prefers cold appetizers and off-the-run types of items (especially uni and clams, etc.), the menu here is perfect for my tastes. My favorite items from his sushi bar include: uni-ika sugomori zukuri (the creativity, construction, and flavor of this dish is sublime), live lobster sashimi (Ie never had a better preparation for lobster), and basically every item on this part of the menu (aoyagi carpaccio, geoduck clam salad, shiro ebi tar tare, shimi aji carpaccio, hokki nuta, goma tofu, ...). Everything is fabulous. I recommend ordering several cold dishes followed by 1-2 hot dishes From the Kitchen (which are also very good). I wouldn recommend spending your appetite on the nigiri or rolls, since the star attractions are the From the Sushi Bar and From the Kitchen menu items.The discreet entrance on 6th Ave, and the minimalist decor of the restaurant (some people may complain that it is too bright and stark, but I actually like the decor very much) is somehow very fitting. This place is something special; it not the excellent, but flashy (and therefore popular but in a run-of-the-mill kind of way - both in the cuisine and the atmosphere) sushi bar that exists in abundance in NYC. Is there another restaurant of this quality, where the Chef is a perfectionist who does everything, including answering the phones (when the restaurant is not open) to take reservations?', 'This is my favorite sushi bar outside of Japan. I always get the 12 piece Omakase which is absolutely amazing and also reasonably priced at $60. Owner Soto san is the only one making the nigiri so when the restaurant is busy you should probably order some appetizers until your sushi comes.', 'WOW - Really outstanding. Have been 4 times now and sat at the bar and the tables, and have ordered both ala carte and the Omakase menu. Absolutely sit at the bar and put yourself in the hands of a master. And by all means move beyond the sushi section of the menu to try some of the most inventive dishes.I am not a big fan of uni, but his uni dishes are amazing. He does a dish that has tofu, uni and topped with dried uni - sounds disgusting, but it is one of the best things I have ever tasted. The Dobin Mushi Soup is exquisite, and the Lobster with Uni Mousse is decadent. You should probably go with adventurous diners, the California Roll eaters out there might not get it.Sure it is expensive, but no more so than any of the top tier Japanese restaurants in the city. And this one is definitely top tier.', 10.16.08Look what you did to me, Soto! Drove me to eat the greasy nastiness/goodness that is Gray's Papaya after only one glass of wine. Not drunk, but driven by our grumbling stomachs and much lightened wallets, we left Soto impressed by the presentation and flavors, but not by the portion sizes., Soto's minimalistic decor reminded me of other hardcore sushi destinations, such as Sushi Yasuda and Sushi of Gari. These three understated sushi dens focus on simplicity, both in their Japanese culinary preparations and environments. They understand that you do exaggerated Disneyesque decor and crazy roll concoctions are not necessary when inspiring true sushi lovers. Soto patrons come here to sit at the bar in awe of the amiable and skilled Soto himself. Soto's menu changes daily and includes a variety of small tasting plates, sushi bar samples, and larger kitchen entrees. Some courses start in the affordable $5 range, while others small portioned items reach a steep $25-30. I was blown away by my first Soto experience. While I entered the restaurant mildly hungry, I ate with the kind of continued vigor one could only possess after such a flavorful course progression. As its season had just began, the Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab was a must. The crispy live crab was coated in a fragrant curry salt. At first I was put off by the dangling claws, but I devoured them as easily as the crab body. The daily special roll of Tuna Tartare was a spicy blend of chopped tuna, asian pear, cucumber, avocado, sesame, pine nuts, and scallion. This combination of textures was wrapped inside white seaweed, which has a more subtle flavor than the traditional green version. By using white kelp, Soto was able to enhance the flavor of the inner ingredients. The spicy tartare had a savory flavor similar to a hot barbecue glaze. The Scallop Shisho Roll included melt-in-your-mouth raw scallop and fragrant shiso leaf. The Negi Toro Roll was enhanced by scallion shavings and was my favorite of the three maki. I also sampled several pieces of sushi, such as the Zuke, which was a soy marinated big eye tuna from Costa Rica. Soto delicately brushed the tuna with just enough soy to add flavor but not mask the freshness of the fish. The Amberjack from Hawaii and Sea Scallop from Maine were also tasty. My favorite piece of succulent fish was the Sakura Masu, or Pink Sea Trout. Though it looked like a slice of salmon, the trout had a smooth crisp flavor like I have never before experienced. Even two pieces of it were not enough! Just when we were about to come out of our sushi-induced haze, I realized that we had not sampled any of the Uni that had made Soto famous. Boy was I glad not to have missed my piece of sea urchin sushi. With its strong flavor and rich consistency, uni is often an acquired taste. However, this was the lightest, cleanest sea urchin I have ever tried. I washed down this delicious meal with some great Japanese beers off of their decently-sized beverage menu.I would definitely recommend Soto to serious sushi fanatics. Even writing about it is making me hungry..., 'Interesting and beautiful food: You bet. Satisfying dining: Not really. Had uni/squid construction -- great uni, fabulous looking -- built to look like a sea urchin. Tempura. Langustine. Black cod. Creamy black and white tofu. Everything tasted great and looked great. But holy moly, there were wee small portions, and the sake prices were shocking. At the end of the meal, I kid you not, we went out for some pizza slices down the block. Never had that issue at Yasuda.Still, I would say go. Just be prepared to leave hungry.', 'I give three stars to this place. The food was great going down - a definite 5 stars. But definitively 0 stars for what happened when I came home. Creative tasty food and great service - VERY expensive.', I've lived in Japan for 3 years, and eaten a fair amount of sushi both in Japan and in New York. I heard the buzz about this place, and on a recommendation from a friend, I took my Japanese wife and in-laws here to ease their American-food weary bellies.While I've had small, overpriced proportions in my time, this was insulting. I didn't say anything, but waited for my Japanese guest's response. They were actually visibly upset (which is a rare thing to see), and two of my guests muttered under their breath that the head chef was a thief. $18 for a tenth of an ounce of food? We laughed when the first dish came out, but that quickly turned to anger.Did it taste wonderful? Sure. But unless you're raking in AIG bonuses or living off an obscene amount of income or a trust fund, you WILL be insulted by this restaurant's audacity. It's not like it's a great atmosphere. The interior looks half-finished. I saw plenty of posh and pompous types in there, mostly europeans enjoying the exchange rate. But if you can say hard-working, or American, without being sarcastic, this place is not for you., I love great sushi! I thought the prices were reasonable for the quality, though the portions were small -- but this ain't cheesecake factory! Good selection of sake. The only complaint I have is their slow service, but it's not fast food and if you want the head sushi chef to make your dish then you have to be patient. Wish they had a more conspicuous sign out front -- hard to make recommendations when there's no sign for the place., Everytime I go back to Soto, I can't stop raving about it to my friends. The food is absolutely stellar (definitely have the lobster sashimi with uni mousse, you also can't go wrong with the omakase sushi too). It's not just that every bite you take is absolutely delectable and perfect but it's also that Soto-san himself is a pleasure to talk to and a true sushi artist. If you have a real appreciation for sushi and are willing to try different kinds of fish this is definitely the place for you.Every person I've taken here has absolutely LOVED it., You'll walk right by this place and never know it exists. At least I didn't for over a year till my bf took me here for a quick bite after the gym. I had no idea what lie behind those white partitions. The food is totally ritual in this lil temple of culinary adventure. You should like sushi and bring a fat wallet. For a late night sitting they didn't have a prob with my t-shirt and jeans but you may feel more comfortable if you dress up a bit. Scrumptiously adventurous. Keep in mind portions are small tapas style plates., Soto, named after the sushi master himself, is unmatchable in quality across the board. Soto positions himself behind the sushi bar and takes his craft very seriously, being known to fire people on the spot if everything is not exactly as he wants it. The service is impeccable (fresh hot hand towels between every dish!)Beyond all the details, the food is some of the best I have ever had of any cuisine. The menu changes daily, and I would take the chef's suggestions as no one knows sushi -- in NYC -- like Soto., This places rocks!! Had an incredible dinner yet it was totally expensive, $180 for myself Omakasa, sake, 1 beer but well worth it!!!I would certainly go back again, Soto is perfection!! It has been some time since I've seen dishes look so beautiful and taste that amazing. The fish was so fresh as if it had just been caught.Cannot wait for my return visit!!, If you are looking for something unexpected, exceptional and delicious, then pls disregard the 1-3 star givers who complain of lack of volume. C'mon America, what Soto serves would be considered gluttony anywhere but in the States and maybe Italy. Do we need to pig out to justify spending money? Personally, I'd rather see elegance of presentation, on-the-money flavor combination, fresher than fresh ingredients. IMO, Soto is what Matsuhisa's was 20 years ago when chef Matsuhisa (as in Nobu Matsuhisa) served up some of the most inventive cuisines anywhere., Food is not very good. Sushi was cut well but the fish wasn't that great so all the good cuts in the world wouldn't help that. It was at least not very expensive (for sushi). It wasn't very crowded after 9pm on a Saturday night but the people that were there were not foodies and just wanted a chic looking restaurant. Try something else if you're looking for good sushi., Soto must be one of my favorite restaurants in the world, or at least NYC. The food is nothing short of phenomenal and it's always a pleasure to sit before the unassuming Sotohiro Kosugi-san when I'm not dining with a group at a table. Uni is the restaurant's raison d'etre and any preparation where it appears is going to be good. I think Kosugi-san sources most of his from Santa Barbara, but sometimes does have uni from Hokkaido, as well. Regardless of the source, the uni is impeccably, reliably fresh and as sweet as can be. It's not really accurate to call Soto a sushi restaurant, though it does serve sushi. While the sushi is decent to good, the non-sushi preparations far outshine the sushi. Each plate is an individual art composition -- visual and gustatory -- a brilliant combination of vivid flavors that never overwhelm delicately flavored fish and crustaceans. The compositions are plated beautifully, with translucent, sweet fish offset by bright, slightly bitter greens or crispy, barely vinegared Japanese cucumber slices or a pretty, light green wasabi tobiko. This is some of the most beautiful, nuanced and delicious food I've had anywhere in the world. My favorites on the current menu: - Uni tempura with uni powder (creamy... amazing)- Uni Ika Sugomori Zukuri (sea urchin wrapped in thinly sliced squid and shiso served with quail egg and tosa soy reduction)- Geoduck Clam Salad (ginger marinated giant clam, japanese cucumber, daikon and shiso, spicy radish sprouts)- Kampachi Tar Tare (chopped hawaiian amber jack with wasabi tobiko, pine nuts, served with soy foam -- note that this is pretty accessible for non-adventurous eaters)- Steamed Lobster With Uni Mousse (layers of steamed Maine lobster and uni mousse in lotus wrap garnished with smoked uni and caviar; the smoked uni is a perfect foil for the sweet lobster)Do note that portions tend to be small and they are not inexpensive as other reviewers have pointed out -- but Soto is very much worth an occasional splurge, I think. It's probably the only place in NYC that I can always count on to have very fresh uni. Even Yasuda-san sources uni of variable quality at his restaurant; Kosugi-san has never served me a bad piece. I can't rave enough.p.s. Soto doesn't serve dessert except for mochi ice cream (a platter of five half-pieces of green tea, red bean, strawberry and two other flavors). p.p.s. They do have a short, but well chosen sake list, all served at their individual, optimal temperatures and kept this way in the back until refills are needed. p.p.p.s. Check out the motorized R2D2 shaped trashcan in the bathroom. I spent a good five minutes playing with it., Uni Heaven. I thought I had tried the perfect uni dish at Aldea last month, a bite-sized Sea Urchin Toast that was light and foamy and reminiscent of the sea. That was before I dined at Soto. Who knew sea urchin could be so versatile and transcendent?Uni is that briney, rich, (and let's admit it) weird shellfish with a cult following among adventuresome eaters. I often find it to be too rich and salty for my palette. But, in the hands of Chef Sotohiro Kosugi, uni is transformed into a vibrant canvas of flavors.Much of the menu at Soto incorporates uni, a la variations on a theme. The small plates are perfectly composed and display masterful technique and flavor compositions. The standout dish for me was the Steamed Lobster With Uni Mousse, layers of uni mousse and lobster wrapped in lotus and garnished with smoked uni and caviar. The flavors were simultaneously delicate, rich and light.The Kampachi Tar Tare, a tartare of jack fish, is also a winner. Unexpectedly, the pine nuts really stood out in this dish and the soy foam was an excellent accompaniment. The Uni Ika Sugomori Zukuri was visually beautiful and texturally interesting, a bird's nest of sea urchin and yari squid topped with a quail egg.All of the plates I tasted were excellent or very good and displayed the common themes of perfect composition and depth of flavors and textures.Excellence comes with a price, however. Soto is fairly expensive and the plates are fairly small. Diners who refuse to succumb to the cult of uni may not enjoy dining at Soto. For the uni aficionados, Soto will be a near religious experience.As for beverage offerings, the sake list is fairly extensive. There is a decent wine menu but the wine by the glass offerings are limited. The only dessert at Soto is ice cream mochi served in a variety of five flavors (green tea, red bean, strawberry, mango and vanilla). I don't know whether the mochi is handmade at the restaurant but it certainly taste that way.Service is very slow, so it is advisable to order promptly upon seating., Soto is the type of sushi place that easily allows you to be adventurous. The menu is structured so that all the specials showcase a delighftully, exotic type of sushi without being overwhelmingly esoteric or daunting. Novices will walk out of there having tried the uni for the first time, and loving it.I was floored by the Ika (squid), the uni, and the sea bream.Added bonus, even though it's on 6th ave, the environment is quite peaceful and relaxed. Isn't it nice to have an alternative to the other medicore downtown sushi options?, If you love uni, you need to RUN here. By the end of my meal, my love for sea urchin had quadrupled. I felt like I didn't even know what I was in love with before I had uni at Soto., 'This well hidden gem in NYC with no sign on the outside is great sushi....very high-end sushi menu that is all about the chefs imagination vs. your own. Tuna Tartar was to die for and the best I have ever had. Warning: they do not have a full bar. Beer, Sake and Wine. I would have given it 5 star if they had a bar.', Despite the prices, the food was amazing. The steamed lobster with uni dish was sublime. Minus one star for still having to eat a pizza to get full after dinner, but i'd still recommend this place to anyone, especially those richer than me!, 'i liked the entrance to soto... very retro i may add.. the restaurant, while desolate, was simple upkeep. not that there is anything wrong with that....we sat at the bar, i like to do so whenever i get the chance. instead of omakase, i wanted to try a few of their non-sushi dishes. this place is suppose to be uni heaven right? soto is something of an anomaly and wonderment. too pretty to touch, to exotic to NOT want to touch. their japanese dishes are much better than their sushi. it was evident in everything that we ate.. very unexpected, but what the hell do i know about expectations these days?everything was delicious...the uni cocktail and the kanpachi amberjack tartare were among my favorites. tried their scallop, chu-toro and salmon sashimi....which were ok.. their regular, creative, innovative dishes are what makes soto worth going to. the portions here are very tiny, so don expect to leave super full either. presentation and service was excellent! though a part of me definitely felt something was missing. i wasn 100% satisfied...but i was moving on to bigger, better things in a matter of hours. time to buckle down and move on!', 'I had a hard time finding this restaurant but luckily my friend texted me the address. It is very unassuming from the outside, looking as simplistic and clean as the inside. Their menu has a small plates, from the sushi bar, from the kitchen, and sushi / nigiri / sashimi sections. I felt like there was a good variety of things, though many dishes featured the same ingredients - umi, fatty tuna, yuzu - I appreciated the fact that their sushi / nirigi selection had a nice variety.I enjoyed my dishes for the most part and they had a really interesting daily roll. Everything is nicely presented and tasted pretty good. I would say this is a solid place to check out and perhaps return to.', This restaurant doesn't even have the name displayed in front, but I had the address so it wasn't hard to find. Ok, in short, this place is AWESOME!!! High quality of fish, interesting fishes. They also have several interesting appetizers. We had Fluke Usuzukuri, cocktail Uni, and cocktail scallop as the appetizers. They didn't disappoint us at all. Uni is the MUST here - it's mouth watering. Anyway, I'm drooling while I'm writing this..lol Will definitely come back.PS. portion is very tiny!!, Food's fresh and well prepared. Small, I mean tiny, portions, especially for the price. But it is quality.Ambiance - Take a hard look at what the interior looks like. Sterile, no fun, too bright.The dessert, which is pictured here, was very good. It's the only dessert they offer.There are places where the food is as good for the same price, maybe even less, that will offer a better dining experience given this place's boring & sterile vibe. Feels like it lacks some character but can't put my finger on it.Not bad, I don't feel cheated or ripped off, just wouldn't go back.Good luck., Soto is a Michelin starred sushi house just off of west 4th street. How I have never been here before or have heard about this place is beyond me! It's a nice find.I made a reservation for one, but that was ultimately unnecessary since there was only one other person at the entire sushi bar on my visit. I was seated in front of Sotohiro Kusugi himself -- nice. A third generation sushi chef, I found him to be affable, in control, and always professional. The restaurant itself was the essence of Japanese minimalism, comically taken to the point of not even having a sign outside of the restaurant. You will likely need the street address to find the place as I have walked by it for years unaware. For dinner, I opted for the 12 piece nigiri omakase at an attractively priced $58. I was warned that it would take some time to prepare the sushi and was strongly encouraged to try some appetizers in the mean time. I found this strange, but I quickly relented. I additionally ordered the miso soup which, surprisingly, is not included in the sushi dinner. To drink, I went with the Koshihikari Echigo beer. The miso came in at a pricey $10 for a small bowl (all of the other menu selections were considerably more expensive and equally appetizer sized). As far as miso goes though, this was considerably better than the usual offering. It was jazzed up by mixing in a lobster broth with the white miso and including chunks of lobster as well as chives and ginger shoots for flavoring. I appreciated the sophistication, but I was not overcome by the broth. The flavors did not meld as well as I would have liked. Also, the lobster was too sparse to justify the price point. Now for the sushi, the part that really matters. The selection was impressive with some uncommon choices in the mix. Definitely no salmon and hamachi here. This omakase was designed for the enthusiast. - The first selection was completely unfamiliar to me. It sounded like enamae. It had a characteristic green marking in its flesh and hailed from Japan. A nice beginning, the rice was quite good, soft, and served at the right temperature (a sign of a good sushi house). The fish was fresh and melted in my mouth. - Squid. Very nice. I was surprised by how tender it was. Another good selection.- Tasmanian ocean trout. A less common selection, but one I was pleased with. Great color. The flavor and texture were wonderful. - Aji (horse mackerel). Fine, if otherwise unremarkable.- Stripejack. This was brought out only moments after the placing of the horse mackerel. At this point, I noticed the tempo of the meal picking up, though I understood why these two sushi might be paired together. I did not have the presence of mind to ask if it was wild or farm raised. It was quite tasty, making me wonder if it was the wild version which is known to be rare. - Ama ebi (live sweet shrimp). Yes, raw shrimp, not that dreadful cooked shrimp that you will find at discount sushi houses. This was so amazingly good. The natural sweetness, the texture, it was all wonderful. I even said as much to the itamae, to which he politely smiled and nodded. - Saba bakno? (more mackerel). I wasn't sure what type of mackerel this was, but it was enjoyable. - Toro. No proper omakase can exclude toro. This example was deliciously fatty and fresh.- Maine sea scallop with sea salt and yuzu zest. A regional selection! Akin to the raw shrimp, this too was naturally sweet and delicious. Good scallops are like that -- never a miss.- Japanese sea bream with pickled wasabi inside. The wasabi was especially noticeable with its lovely piquancy. This was especially good. Another great selection.- Uni. Noticeably large and generous in portion size. This was clearly a high grade uni. It too had natural sweetness. Good uni can be so decadent.- Unagi (freshwater eel). This was fine, but I was surprised that this was the final course. Swapping the order with the uni would have been more memorable, for example. A wonderful sushi experience. I did not find it to be the best sushi in the city, but it does easily place in my top five. The ease of getting a seat with the master sushi chef, and the rich diversity in the selection are distinctive points of note. The place is definitely on par with Ushiwakamaru if not a touch better. Recommend., I came here with no expectations, as the SO had booked it and I hadn't bothered to look it up. It wasn't totally busy on a Sat night, which was a bit of a bummer for the scene/buzz, but this disappointment quickly dissipated when the first dish arrived... and my happiness with the place kept growing with each dish (all TEN of them). There is only one word for this place: AMAZING! I know some people might want to compare this to Yasuda, but it isn't a fair comparison at all - they are just totally different.I not only will be back... I can't WAIT to go back!, 'If you are a sushi aficionado, order a custom Omakase at the sushi bar. Tell Soto what you like, your budget and you are in for an experience. The variety of ingredients, he will serve you is really amazing and delicious. I always enjoy my meals here......... Omakase meals should be eaten at the bar and expect a leisurely meal. Sample a few of the Sakes on the menu and talk to your date while you wait. One of the better Japanese Restaurants in NYC. One of my favorites for Sushi.', food is excellent. tiny plates that leave you wanting more. a place for more serious diners of Japanese foods. I really enjoyed the overall experience.terrible service though. the waitresses should definitely be replaced by better ones. definitely replace them with Japanese ones as well. i feel that a place like this should have a staff that is Japanese. i feel that when the waiting staff is not, a place loses some credibility and the food is actually affected somewhat (even though they are not doing the actual prep or cooking).... course sequence and recommendations can go wrong I believe. I know most high end sushi/japanese restaurants have a very clean and well designed space, but this place is exceptionally clean looking, haha. i felt that by walking in, i was creating a mess with my shoes. it is just so clean-cut looking. I really enjoyed the design aspects of the place as well. uni-lovers paradise. if you have to get your uni-fix, this place offers many variations of small uni dishes. if it's prime uni season and you're in the mood for some uni, this place will not disappoint., Soto is the kind of restaurant that showcases top ingredients in the most subtle of ways. The uni and mackerel heavy menu may turn off sushi lovers who normally order Philadelphia rolls and think unagi and salmon are traditional for Japanese sushi and the smaller portions at higher prices may turn off a hungry diner; but no one can deny the quality of the meal they are getting when they dine at Soto. If you want to explore different types of raw fish you wouldn't normally try, this is where you would do it. The space accommodates 42 diners and the unassuming ambiance of the space is merely the canvas on which Sotohiro Kusugi creates his masterpieces. Here are some of the dishes I tried...Chyu Toro Tar Tare chopped fatty part of big eye tuna with avocado coulis, garnished with caviar, chive, served in sesame ponzu sauce....This dish was a highlight and as rich as a foie gras mousse.Wild Snapper Carpaccio new zealand wild snapper with aged vinegar and sea salt sesame oil garnished with chopped ginger shoot and cilantro Fluke Usuzukuri thinly sliced long island fluke with sea salt and lime juice, touch of yuzu zestsushi - yellow fin tuna & pink sea troutBroiled Lobster With Mango, Portabella lightly broiled maine live lobster an mango, portabella mushroom under pankorolls - special roll of the day - spicy tuna roll with asian pear, cucumber, avocado, sesame, pine nuts, scallion, wrapped in white kelpscallop shiso dessert -assorted mochi...I love mochi, but have never had it this fresh before!Dining here was a great food experience and I will be back!One important note I forgot to mention...the service wasn't great. While they kept our water, sake and wine chilled, they were less than prompt refilling our glasses. Also, pouring wine into my sake glass rather than the wine glass was a bit off-putting., 'Sotohiro Kusugi Soto is currently a 1 Michelin Starred restaurant experience that will receive a solid 3 Yelp stars from me based on the average of:- 2 stars for Service/Experience- 3.75 stars for FoodSoto is known to us as 357 because there isn a sign on the door allowing you to walk past it and not notice it. The simple white/beige decor synonymous to most Japanese restaurants is exactly what Soto is. They do however, have an awesome green/metallic/bricky backsplash behind the sushi bar that looks pretty cool. I did notice that this menu is very heavily focused on uni and mackerels as other Yelpers have stated.We ordered:- 2 seaweed salads---- this was pretty good as far as a seaweed salad goes, not overly stringy/getting stuck in your teeth, good balance of spice and light dressing- Wild Snapper Carpaccio---- the aged vinegar and sea salt paired well for this dish as the wild snapper however, was a bit fishy causing me to think that adding a hint more salt would help remove the fishyness taste- Shima Aji Carpaccio---- the strip jack fish, which Ie never had before, proved to be the best dish of the evening. We found the truffle soy ginger sauce to be an absolutely divine companion in a briney form yet subtle and velvetty.- Tuna Tartare Roll---- this was quite flavorful, like POW in your face flavorful for a maki roll...the fluke paper that the roll was wrapped in was awesome!- Scallop Shiso Roll---- this was pretty straight forward and good. Scallop, rice, seaweed combined with a hint of shiso leaf really gave this roll the depth of flavor it needs. fantastic.- Negi Toro roll---- fatty tuna / toro. Yes. Order it. Simple. Good. Yummy.- Junmai Kuguki Sake 300ml---- this was about $42 for the 300ml if I not mistaken, not as clear and refreshing as the description states, so it was fair at best.Now folks, here why Soto receives 3 stars.The service and confusion throughout the evening between the servers proved to be quite comical (I being facetious, I think...?) yet annoying and irritating.Confused server scenario #1:The first server took our sake order, left the table and another server right behind him asked us for our order leaving us confused if the first server had processed our sake order. So I asked server #2 if server #1 has our sake order, he looks at me with a blank stare and then asks me again what would you like to order... so umm we re-ordered the sake....eh? Confused server scenario #2:We ordered the Tuna Tartare roll as part of one of the items for our meal, and so they confused that for the tuna tartare appetizer (which we later realized). They brought us this Tuna Tartare item, which we thought was what we ordered but wasn, the server explained every layer of the dish and then the server walks away. NOW FOLKS - close your eyes and imagine this - ************we pickup our chopsticks, all 3 of us, we go to grab the tuna tartare concoction and then a DIFFERENT SERVER comes to our table and GRABS the plate and RUNS AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*********** LMAO!? wtf?! We were literally 1.5inches above the plate to dig in, and the plate was STOLEN from underneath our chopsticks as fast as you swat a fly with a fly swatter....WTF GUY!? really???? She ran away so fast with the snatched dish and we looked at each other like WTF Is going on!??!?!?! She said nothing, none of the other servers said anything and she whisked the plate straight to the back? we were blown away with what just took place!!!!!!!!! LMAO! We were so dazed, confused and blown away, we didn even put our chopsticks down...WTF to the max moment!!!!!!!^eh ????Confused server scenario #3: When it came time to ordering apps and sushi etc, I specifically wanted to order JUST the apps, leave 1 menu on the table and order the sushi after the apps come...we weren in a rush and wanted a 15-20 minute break between courses. A different server (different from scenario #1) got all hot-n-heavy when I explained to him that I like to hold off a bit before we order the sushi and muttered to us that oooo sushi take time, it busy restaurant... I knew EXACTLY what was going to happen, which was we order our sushi now, it shows up immediately after our appetizers will without a break in between. So what happens???? The SUSHI SHOWS UP immediately after the appetizers were finished, and in fact, the appetizer plate wasn even cleared from the table yet!!!!!!!!!!! I love how I can predict restaurants..............eh?seriously? what up with the crazy weird servers at this place? It really aggravates us because if the crazy confused server shenanigans didn take place, it would be receiving 4 stars from me and not 3 if they service was at least on-point and attentive, like most Manhattan restaurants of this caliber.', 'Sushi and appetizers were great. Main courses are not worth it... I would just order lots of sushi and appetizers next time. Service is horrible... we sat there for 10 minutes before they brought us a menu. The servers were congregated behind the sushi bar chatting and having a good time while they completely ignored us. When they brought us the menu, it was from the day before so we had to wait for the updated menu. Our waitress made us feel unwelcome so we rushed through our dinner to get out of there!', The food here is excellent. The first dish of raw fish slices with truffle oil gave the meal an incredible start. The uni appetizer was too thick and not worth the 28 dollar bite. The lightly seared bass in soy sauce tasted like one of the steamed whole fish in a Chinese place except, 1/10th as much. The thing that impressed me the most was the sushi omakase which tasted just like ones at Sushi Daiwa Tsukiji market. Warm rice with fish at the right temperature, be it the cold uni or the steamy hot eel. It's quite fitting of its Michelin one star rating, and much better than Jewel Bako. The service is substandard for a Japanese place. But I gather this is nothing new., 'I have been here many times, one of my favorite Japanese menu for serious fan of uni and ika. The food is amazing, (small portions new style sashimi for tasting and excellent mushroom flavored crayfish) Each time we get in NY, we will dinners reserved (twice) at Soto, bar masa and twice at blue riboon but the favourite more unusual is Soto.Unfortunately, will have to give it a pass from now on. Mr Kosugi should replace the servers. They are horrible and clueless. Employ professional japanese or western. They were constantly chatting, bored. lazy, cheap and DONE professionally different from the chefs. The servers destroyed the atmosphere in there, making it really uncomfortable nearly everytime we ate there (10~ so far) and FINALread the other reviews,,, we love your food but your servers are chasing us away.5 star for food1 star for service', 'I highly enjoyed my experience at Soto as a quick glance at their menu gave me the impression that they too were uni lovers. However, I didn get an authentic vibe when one of the sushi chefs (or perhaps busboys) was Mexican and my waiter spoke with a high Chinese accent. Don get wrong, I am all about equal opportunities, but when a white guy is trying to sell me a $15 taiwanese sandwich (cough XIE XIE), my pride will takeover and automatically think he knows sh!t about cilantro and crushed peanuts.I digress.Portions are definitely on the small side as I did not leave the restaurant stuffed to the brim, but if I would have, I probably would have spent 1-month rent at Soto and that wouldn be kosher at all.Get anything uni here, you won regret it.', Make a reservation pray to god you're on a expense account and make sure your a true purest when it comes to sushi. Only the sauce that comes with the dish itself. They don't beieve in bottles of soy sause thank god. Biggest complaint as many of us Yelpers portions very small even for sashimi you spend a small fortune and you're definitely still hungry. But fresh and delicious.|2
48|spiaggia-chicago|Wow - what a waste of money! I chose this place because I wanted to take my friend to an expensive high-end Italian restuarant on Michigan Avenue. However, what I didn't know: high-end = skimpy portions! Everything I ordered - even my entree - was the size of a medium tomato...if that! The stuff didn't even taste that good either. I paid $200 for 2 people with tip....and we didn't even order that much! So no filling...and the service was mediocre. The only thing I was impressed with was the dining room and the view of Michigan Ave....very aesthetically pleasing - but that's it!, 'This glossy highrise is located at Michigan and Oak, basically the starting northern point of the Magnificent Mile. It has mainly offices, but there are a few expensive shops on the main level plus the upscale Spiaggia eateries. I think Spiaggia is a bit overrated, or perhaps I am prejudiced by the thought that I can enjoy very good Italian food in Chicago at much lower prices.', Maybe I liked it because I wasn't the one paying. Very Northern Italian/French. The Gnocchi melted in my mouth. I was pleased with everything I ate. Gentlemen beware, coat required., I (stupidly) came to Spiaggia without a sportsjacket. They, luckily, had one there for me. Other than that...the experience and the food were amazing. They had gnocci with a truffle sauce that was unbelievable. The best gnocci I have ever had, for sure. The portions are not what you will find at an Italian American place....but you will enjoy it, for sure.Did I mention that I didn't pay for this meal? That makes it easier to enjoy...for sure., Went here for a first date and wasn't disappointed (in either the guy or the food)! If you're looking for a romantic Italian restaurant and don't have the extra cash to spend, then this is the place to go. It has the same great food and service as its big sister restaurant, Spiaggia, with a lower price tag. If you really want to impress your date, ask for a table with a view (I got a little glimpse of the lake beyond the Mag Mile), and order the potato gnocchi. It's the best gnocchi I've had in the city (and this is coming from a girl who didn't even know what gnocchi I went there)., 'Hidden treasure on Michigan Ave! The food here is exquisite and melts in your mouth. Save room for dessert - their tiramisu and gelato are to die for! Make reservations and ask for a table by the window!', 'Spiaggia, which I believe means the beach in Italian, has great views of the lake during the day! It located right behind and above Oak Street Beach. At night I think it one of the most romantic places to have dinner. The Reverence of the place is great. I think a Guy should throw on a jacket and tie (ties are optional) every once in a while and take his girl out to the best! This place has been rated the best in Chicago a couple of times. It expensive but, I feel, worth it. You are not just paying for the food! Ambiance isn free. I actually bring my own bottle of wine and pay the cork fee. I loved the tasting menu. The staff was very cordial and made me feel like I was a King. (they made me look good in front of the babe too) The food, I think, is incredible! Everything melts in your mouth. Great Cheese selections and the deserts are wonderful! A Real 5 Star Restaurant!', Top of the line attentiveness, just enough undertoned attitude and finicky detail to make one feel pampered, welcome, and privileged. My future father-in-law's Archie Bunkeresque critique of the portions humiliated the staff, as they sputtered to and fro in attempt to placate. Five stars for the humour alone.Do go, and enjoy!, 'One of the waiters has a crush on my boyfriend, but his flirting is so much fun to watch. They make a good bloody mary and have a decent wine list with a few favorites of ours. The view is supposed to be of Michigan but the lower roof is a huge distraction and some of the tables can feel small and as if you are standing in the middle of a hallway. I recommend the left room if you want less chance except be warned of drunken parties that can be loud in such a small space. All considered the food is above average the service has always been wonderful and the location is very convenient for those of us in gold coast out shopping or playing for the day.', Seriously not impressed with Spiaggia. The only impressive thing about it is the location- which to me just translates into EXPENSIVE.I had the buffalo mozz/tomato/basil salad. I could honestly make better at home. Then some type of savory crepe, which was overloaded with garlic.Main course was 1/2 chicken baked under a brick marinated in grappa. Ok honestly I have had better rotisserie chicken for MUCH less (See my review for Semiramis).I should probably preface my dessert comments by saying that I am not much of a dessert person anyway- and I'm specifically not much of a crepe person. Chocolate crepes were just okay. They looked pretty but I really didn't care for them. $200 for two for the above. I am positive I could make better at home for less than $25.PS I fed the leftover chicken to my dog., My manager brought me here for my birthday lunch, and it was wonderful. It's classy and friendly, and the food is superb. I had the gnocchi, which absolutely melts in the mouth. For dessert I had the apple torte with caramel gelato, but after tasting my manager's tiramisu, I knew he made the better choice. Amazing!, My disclaimer with this review is that I had one meal at Spiaggia two years ago. What I do remember was that my then boyfriend and I had a variety of courses and were pretty underwhelmed with the food for the price. However, one of my date's courses was so good that I can remember it even after all this time. It was a small but delicious combination of duck and gnocchi. If they served a big bowl of that, I would be back in an instant!, 'Ie been here about 4 times over the past 9 years and boy do things change. This was one of the first fancy restaurants I ever went to, and it was fantastic. Then a new chef took over and things took a turn for the worse. I am very happy to report that the current chef is turning out better food than ever!Go here for a romantic dinner for two, or to impress business clients. Ask for a table by the window--the view is to die for!', 'By FAR the most pretentious place Ie ever been. I had a friend in from NYC who is a BIG foodie...everytime she comes to Chicago, she wants to try out the fancy dining and Il indulge. She dragged me to Alinea last time (not that I complaining, it was amazing). So we got a group together, dressed up, and headed to Spiaggia...NOT expecting to be treated like 12 year oldsFirst thing they did....ASKED FOR OUR ID!! OK. I 27. I was the youngest in the group. I look 27, not 16. We were dressed appropriately. It was totally bizarre.But it got worse. Once we were seated, the waitress proceeded to talk to us as if we never been in a restaurant nicer than TGI Fridays. She gave a whole speech on how if we were looking for spaghetti and meatball type, large dishes, there are plenty of other restaurants in Chicago for that, but it wasn their style. No shit, Sherlock. We literally felt like we were being scolded the entire night. The waitress questioned our dining choices (I suggest another course, I not sure you understand how small the portions are), spoke to us as if we were children, and overall made us want to get up and leave. The food was good. I enjoyed the mushroom risotto the most, and the gelatos were to die for. BUT, i wasn blown away enough to justify the prices, especially after being made to feel like I didn belong. Spiaggia needs to get over itself and learn to treat people. Even those who are....gasp...under 50.', 'Being such a tourist magnet, the mag mile -- Michigan Avenue -- seemed to be an area that littered with poseur restaurants: places that pretended to have good food, but offered overpriced items of mediocre quality. The Italian restaurant Spiaggia helps break that myth for me. Yes, it expensive and I think some would still argue overpriced (the reason for docking a star) since the food is wonderfully prepared but not necessarily innovative. The wine list is expansive and expensive ($1100 bottle anyone?), and the menu is true to Italian dining in the sense that the primi and scondi courses are portioned correctly. Technically, you can -- and should -- order all three courses without having to take things home. For sweets try the sorbetti; there a basil flavor that was a surprisingly pleasant dessert. There also a beautiful selection of Italian cheeses. Service is impeccable, if not a little stuffy.', 'I was actually nervous when I went in to eat because this was like the first fine, fine dining I was going to experience. It was just that, an experience like no other I have been through. I mean when the cheese server dresses better than me, then I know something is up. The courses were a good size although I wish I had more of the truffle pasta (I would have killed a small puppy for more). All of the other courses were just as good and the whole experience made me feel...well pretty darn special. Definately a place to go to at least once just to get the full package. Once again, a lot of small portions equated to a massively full stomach and I think it is worth the price. Definately.', 'I always have great Italian food every time I go there, almost like back home. They use Carnaroli rice for risotto and it cooked al dente. I love it! everything I had was good...and pricy! but of course they make you pay for the atmosphear and the name too.', I went here for my birthday dinner. The room is really nice, and if you do sit by the window you have the Michigan avenue feel! It's got a less pretentious feeling than the main dining room. There is of course, less selection, but that is to be expected. The service that night seemed a bit slow. I ordered a fish course--the waiter, who was friendly enough, neglected to tell me that the dish was going to be very spicy, so it was not quite to my taste. The cafe is a bit more casual, but a note for those of you planning to visit the main dining room--they take their dress code very seriously, so be warned, sweat pant wearers of the world--you're not going to be dribbling any risotto on those sweats at Spiaggia!, 'Hands down, one of the best dining experiences Chicago has to offer and without question the best Italian food in this part of the country.Wee been here several times and always talk about the experience for days.As with great food in the Mediterranean itself, the basic food itself is never overshadowed. The preparation somehow always makes the natural elements of the food seem brighter -- whether it fish, beef, pasta, whatever. Of course this requires everything to be outrageously fresh...which it is.Wine list is impressive, sommelier is very knowledgeable and down-to-earth. Which I appreciate, because I typically get stuck when a list has a lot of Italian wines on it.It is expensive. And Il buy that some people find a slight stuffiness factor here. Like Trotters, Tru, etc. that often comes along with a more formal dining experience. The moment that becomes arrogance, it unacceptable...but Ie never, ever seen anything close to that here.In fact, one of the most striking things about Spiaggia is the level of personal care we always sense, from the preparation of the food itself to the people serving it and how it served.FANtastic.', This was the type of experience we were hoping for on a special occasion. Typically when you know you have to throw caution to the wind when the wallet is concerned and dinner is involved, you expect two things - impecible service and spectacular flavor profiles. One can carry the meal, but you pray for both. Here, the menu is overwhelming and as my boyfriend and I looked over our options (an a la carte menu as well as two different tasting menus, not to mention a very pricey wine list) we were struggling to decide on any one item. So we went for the whole shebang...the grand tasting menu which was featuring DOP specialties. Our cast of servers (this is definitely a team concept restaurant) were incredibly helpful. When Blake decided against a bottle of wine and went for cocktails, the server brought me out tastes not only from their wines by the glass list but also from their open bottles for the tasting menu - showing me the bottle for each and describing them appropriately. Each course came out well timed and its story told as it was set before us. While I admit that I was impressed by only a portion of the items on the tasting menu (definitely try the beef deckle), we went about it the right way. We even stopped mid coursing to order off the a la carte menu when we saw the most delicious plate of homemade gnocchi with ricotta cheese sauce, black truffles, and black truffle oil set down at the table next to us (by the way - YOU HAVE TO ORDER THIS). At the end of the meal, the server thanked us for celebrating and poured us complimentary muscato d'asti (I had ordered it and he brought us both a glass on the house which he refilled mid-dessert). To top the evening off, a jewelry box filled with bite size bits of heavenly desserts left us full to the brim. Admittedly, I don't think we'll go back anytime soon - but only because we have so many others to check off our list. This is definitely a special occasion place and you will leave feeling nothing less than VERY well taken care of., The only reason this place is getting 4 stars is because the service was great. I would definitely recommend staying away from the Tasting Menu's and putting something together yourself here. I will second my Girlfriend's recommendation on the Black Truffle Gnocchi, it was amazing.If you're looking for a really special night go somewhere else, the only thing extra special about my night was my girlfriend..., Wonderful. Excellent service from the host, the waiter, and the augmenting staff.I had the Texas quail and it came out almost buttery with very little, if no, gamey flavor. My friend hunts morning doves, and the meat looks very similar with the potential of the same game-ish flavor. Spiaggia made this to perfection on top of polenta, which only added to an extremely smooth flavor.The tiramisu came out excellent, but their Pedro Ximenez ice cream stole my heart. I adore rum, and this rum-based ice cream with golden raisins is a must-have.I got a bit of a laugh at other reviews mentioning this place as a first date. There's no way I would bring a potentially bad date to a wonderful place, ruining my experience., 'I just had a business lunch here. The service was top notch. They allowed us to talk and did not pressure us in terms of time. I never had to ask for more water or drinks, they just came. Service was a 5 for sure.I ordered the artichoke appetizer. It was great, perfect, a reminder of why you order artichokes at a top restaurant. When done properly, they are close to heaven. I then had the goat cheese wood smoked pizza. This is EXACTLY how a true Italian pizza should be. Perfect. And then, of all things that impressed me, was the latte I ordered. Boy oh boy, had I forgotten what a REAL latte was, as opposed to the blandness that accompanies one from Starbucks.Everyone there seemed to be having a great time. It is definetely on the pricey side ($100 for lunch, NO alcohol) but was perfect for my needs for a business lunch.', Oh, I love this place! The food is excellent, the room is lovely, and you can look down on Michigan Avenue while you eat. The pizzas are always amazing, and the pastas are to die for. The menu seems to change seasonally, so there is always something new, and the specials are usually top-notch. Service has always been terrific. I've never been to Spiaggia itself....too expensive for moi, but since the food in the cafe is fantastic, I can only imagine how good the restaurant is. I feel like this place is a secret oasis on Michigan Avenue that no one knows about. It has always been pretty quiet when I have been there. Finding it is half the battle, but this is a great place for lunch on a day of shopping. I assume they are open for dinner, too, but I have only lunched here. The food is a bit on the pricey side, but the quality is well worth it!, 'Definitely a special occasion place. My Mom and some of her friends took Tammy and me here after I got them tickets to see Oprah.Their tasting menu was both delicous and novel, with courses such as squid ink spaghetti. Unfortunately, the portions were VERY small, which I should learn kinda goes with the tasting menu territory, but it still a little bit disappointing.', 'Outstanding. From the time we walked in till the time we left, the service was outstanding. I felt we were treated like diserving humans that were out for a special treat. The staff was not pretentios, rude or snobbish. This is a big plus with me, especially when I know they could be. The wine list was impressive, and the wine staff was willing to explain each wine in great detail. We opted for the 3-course over the tasing menu. We all made excellent choices---but Mom was the big winner with the Gnocchi for the pasta course. Heaven. Perfection. I could eat that every day. I ordered the Dover sole for dinner. While it was 100 % perfectly prepared, I did not care for it. The waitress asked if everything was ok, and offered me another dinner when I told her. I refused. The restaraunt gave us a table full of desserts on the house, simply because I did not LOVE my dinner. There was nothing wrong with my dinner at all------This fact earned that important fifth star. The chocolate terrene is..............so perfect.I look forward to the day I get to go back.', Absolutely phenomenal Italian food; easily one of the best meals I have had in the city. Also phenomenally expensive, with one bottle of wine, appetizers, main course and dessert the bill was over $400 for two people. However, I think so far it is the best meal I have had in the city. It is far, far better than Tru (which we have been to 3 times, unfortunately), better than Kevin, Nomi, Charlie Trotter's. In fact, the only restaurant that I have been to that is as good is Alinea, but that is more dinner as theater than just a dining experience. We will definitely go back for special occasions., 'You know that feeling when you have been allowing yourself to drink cheap wine for a while and then someone gives you glass of Cakebread? You never ever want to go back. Ever. I had a hard time wanting to eat after such a brilliant meal. I went for their signiture dishes of Seared Scallops and Wood-Roasted Guinea hen wrapped in pancetta. I now know what a near death experiance feels like. I just about died after the first bite, and was completley fine with it. It took every bone in my body to try and leave the table...I was going home mind you. I am not one for elegant dining-mostly due to experiances of over hyped food that left me jaded. But I must say, after one bite under a twinkling chandelier, my little tomboy self felt a little cinderella-ish...only she said the hell with the prince I takin Chef Tony Mantuano home!', My Justin and I have shared many profound moments while drinking wine and dining. We've eaten at the oldest cafe in Paris, we have dined on the grounds of a private vineyard, where our glasses chimed an ancient prayer as they touched. But nothing compares nor have we ever been the same after dining at Spiaggia. Our Past, Present and our Future was represented. TONY MANTUANO IS MY DINING MASTER !!! My heart and soul belong to you. the only part that really sucks about eating here is that for the rest of your life food that is not prepared by this MASTER, is......how shall l say it....vulgar., I would like to give 3.5 stars, but that's not an option, so I've rounded up. I thought the food was excellent. The decor reminds me of a Hilton. I don't think the dining room is compelling visually. The service was very good and the timing was perfect. I think it's a little too expensive compared to the other fine restaurants in the city. We paid $600 for dinner for two, one wine pairing, and two other drinks. It is a top restaurant, but it's certainly not the best restaurant in Chicago. I'd say it's the bottom of the top ten. You won't be disappointed, but you also won't be inspired., 'orgasmic.my company holiday party was held here this year and everything, from the appetizers (mushroom pate w/truffles, chicken pancetta, and calamari) to the main course (filet mignon) to the dessert (it was some sort of profiterole) was de-goddamn-licous.the staff was very friendly and even though we are an insanely loud group, they were very helpful without making us feel inhibited.i would hate to see the bill for this party, but it was worth every penny that i didnt spend...', Very good italian food--the portions are small but exquisite and the view is fantastic too. I think the ambiance will need to be updated in the next couple of years but for now it's attractive enough., It was pretty decent, but didn't really live up to the hype. The view is amazing. I expect a lot out of the restaurants in this city and it just wasn't up there as best of the best for me. That being said, I would go back and give it another chance., 'Eat here the next time it -10 outside and you want to blow $500 on a meal.The indoor valet is probably my favorite feature(right on to Walton from Michigan, first big white garage door to your right).This has been on my to try list for a while. Tlhe food is exquisite for Italian, LOVED the crab appetizer, lobster with saffron, and my husband said his filet was the best he had ever had. The dessert list was a little uninspiring and the cocktail menu could use some attention. I had the passion fruit martini- suddenly passion fruit is everywhere- try the peach one at Mirai, 1 M times better.Anyway, the view would be inspiring by day, but at night, it kind of felt like we were sitting in the middle of an intersection.Would I go back? Nah...not at this price point. Am I glad I went? Yep, now back to the list...', 'One word--Pretentious.Food is over-the-top exquisite, but what ruined the experience was the pretend robotic server from the moment she introduced herself in a Greta Garbo-like, raspy voice with, Helloooo, my name is T-eeeeresa... Paaaaleaze ... I am too old for this and you (the server) are obviously trying too hard when the cuisine speaks for itself. No need to pretend. Just be you.', Went to Spiaggia for a friend's birthday and it was AMAZING, and I do not use that word a lot. The wine list was fabulous and when we asked the waiter to write down the wines for us, they handed us (each) a Spiaggia embossed note card with the wines typed out..talk about service! I think this is the best upscale Italian food I've ever had. This is a very expensive meal so be prepared to drop at least $200 per couple or more. Outrageous on every level, service, food and ambiance, it was all wonderful., 'For being she she, this place was great. It catered to our great upper middle class people. The staff was fantastic. They put our party at one of the best seats in the restaurant. Food was good and the overall experience was great!', Magnifico.I've had many glorious meals both here and at the Cafe. Refined, impeccable service, jaw dropping view. And thats the downside. When the Chef sends a plate out of that kitchen, its like he sends a little piece of his heart. Beautiful presentation, artful preperation and simple, sublime favors.It matters not if its a simple salad or a rich pasta dish or a hearty meat secondi, EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING is made with a masterful hand, a discerning palate and a passion for authentic Italian cooking.Prices, yes, its not cheap but you get what you pay for in quality. Unsurpassed. Truly inspired. Every single thing I've ever had here has been absolutely divine. Bravo Spiaggia, Bravo!, The entire dining experience was amazing...except, and I'm probably wrong, the wine was corked and we spent a few hundred on it, but I usually have a pretty good nose on that! Regardless, the gnocchi (my favorite food) with a white truffle sauce OMG! This was the nicest dining experience Ive had in my entire life....up to this point! We loved the cocktail so much we put it on the menu at Watermark..., 'This is a 2 1/2 star review.My most recent dining experience was a let down for two and a half reasons. First, the service: it was the worst Ie ever experience there, granted, even their worst is better than others, but still. The pacing of the D.O.P. tasting menu felt rushed. The waitress even took one of my dining companion plates while I was still eating; unreal.Second, the risotto was raw. We had an 8:30 reservation. I suspect that they ran out and couldn complete the dish in time for us. I don have any other speculation. I couldn believe they actually served it. I would have been happier had they come out and said We ran out of the risotto. I know how long it takes to cook risotto properly. That dish should never have been served.Lastly, I made a reservation for a table at the window 6 weeks out. That request was not fulfilled, even after I asked about it. I don think that was right either.I not sure Il be going back.', Very rarely will a meal simply blow me away. Spiaggia was one of those rare experiences. If I could give 6 stars, I would.Eric and I went for our first wedding anniversary. We ordered the a la carte menu, and since the chef knew it was our anniversary, we were presented with several courses that were not even on the menu. We were welcomed with celebratory glasses of champagne for our anniversary. The first course from the chef was a perfectly seared scallop in a rich sauce with tons of truffle shavings on top. The next course I had was a beautifully presented beef tartare dish. My husband had the rabbit as a beginning course, which was also delicious.The most memorable part of the meal was the gnocchi. My first bite was simply the most incredible taste-- the gnocchi was hand-rolled, fluffy, melted in my mouth, and the sauce was rich and velvety with drizzled truffle oil. I savored every bite.My entree was a seared royale dorade fish, simply cooked but there was something so rustic and familiar about it-- it reminded me of the way my mom used to fry up fish and crisp up the delicate skin, with melt-in-your-mouth meat. Some may say the food is over-priced. But our dinner was the most memorable meal I've ever had, and a small price to pay for a very special occasion., Our last night in Chicago, me and my friend had dinner here! It was the best dinner on our trip! the pasta was to die for! the sauce was yummy! The server we had was great! If I ever come back to Chicago, I'm coming back here! This was absolutely the best Italian food!, I really wanted to give this place 5 stars but it didn't quite make it. The room and the service are definately 5 stars. The problem we had was with the menu(s), portion size and to a lesser degree the presentation. We started with two glasses of complimentary Champaign. Three of the four choices for bread for the table are house made. All three were very good. We were given two menus. One had two tasting options. One was $255/person plus wine. The other was $165(?)/person plus wine. These were almost entirely seafood. The second menu was the regular menu. This had a high concentration of seafood as well. If you don't care for seafood or red meat there really isn't much of a selection. Spiaggia presents itself as an Italian restaurant not a seafood restaurant. ALL portions were small. Kind of like a snooty French place. On the guenny hen with polenta, we couldn't find the polenta. The veal chop came with veal sweetbreads. I have had sweetbreads before and enjoyed them. These were dry and almost tasteless. The chef's idea of presentation is to plop the food in the center of a large white plate. Not 5 stars. Service was very good except the check was wrong when we first got it. Our server had to redo it. Not much on the wine list under $100. If you plan on going here be aware that it is mostly seafood and the portions are SMALL. Not really Italian., 'I went here for a work event and it was great. There was a buffet set up with steak, mushrooms, polenta, green beans--all very tasty. The view was nice as well, despite being a bit dark outside when I was there. I think it would be nice to go back on a date because the ambiance was very romantic and upscale.', Let me start with the good. Ive travelled all over Italy and ive never had GNOCCHi that is as good as the one they served here. It was to die for. The moment I tried it I just realized I had the realized that it was the best ive ever had and maybe the best I ever will. If you ever come to this place do not pass the GNOCCHI. We were celebrating our anniversary so we wanted to go somewhere nice. My bf originally reserved L20 but I didnt feel like spending 400 bucks for a dinner for two, not in this econormy. We arrived at 980 N Michigan and there were a line of cars and secret service checking people's purses and running metal detectors, I even joked, whats going on, is Obama here? They answered, maybe? We were greeted and asked to wait, it was a 20 min wait, our table was not ready so we sat by the bar and while I was talking with my bf, his mouth opened wide and Obama just walked past us, he was heading to the men's room, all i saw was the back of his head, I was waiting for him to walk back when our maitre d announced our table was ready. When we were about to be seated he said, please dont talk to our special guest, lo and behold, they were sitting behind us. Enough of that. We did not get the degustation for 255 per person coz that too much so we went ala carte. We each did anti pasti, primi and secondi and shared a dessert. Our bill with tip and no wine is 300. Ive dined at Tru and charlie Trotters and paid almost the same price. I cant justify the price at this place. Dont get me wrong its a good place but it doesnt earn my price approval. I would recommend trying this place coz its good but I wont be back. Its good to try once but not worth trying again. Can I have the Gnocchi to go please?, 'Right down the block from my old condo, Spiaggia has gnocchi that is absolutely to die for. I do not have much to say, figuring that the service, hospitality, attention to detail, and overall atmosphere won my heart and stomach. I cannot wait to go back and visit this diamond right off the Magnificent mile. :)', Heaven on Michigan Avenue! I love to sit at a window seat at lunch and people watch. The food is top notch. The chef's special is the way to go. If you are really, I mean REALLY, flush, order the eight course dinner. At $165, you get 8 small portions. My favorite was the cheese course and the dessert sampler. BYW, that was $165 PER PERSON. Ouch!The wine list is beyond intimidating but tell the somillier what price range you are looking for and the wines you enjoy and he/she will be accomodating.The dining room is elegant and quiet. The staff is suprisingly un-stuffy., 'I have eaten lunch as Spiagga Cafe twice and it has only reinforced my desire to go there fr dinner. The food is excellent, and yes, the gnocchi is the best there is... almost like biting into an air pillow of greatness! All of the appetizers are great, the pasta is superb, and the dessert menu is also very good... especially the gelato. I guess it is a little expensive for lunch, but for an occasional spot, its worth it. P.S. the bartender makes a nearly perfect bloody marry (only missing blue cheese olives). If Spiagga is half as good for dinner as it is for lunch it will be worth the bill.', If I was starring in rap videos, the President-Elect or in high finance I'd probably not bat an eye at dropping $550 on dinner, damn you unnecessary $180 bottle of delicious wine! If that were the case, I'd eat here once a week. Alas., My wife and I went here to celebrate a very special occasion and were not disappointed. Babbo is a pinnacle restaurant for me. It was spectacular, but Spiaggia was right there. Seriously. Neck and neck.I should have known. Every time that I get the attitude that you have to travel to New York to WD-40, you get Schwa in Chicago or to Yountville to the French Laundry you get a table at Alinea. Chicago has effin' fantastic food and Spiaggia is among the best here. We went for a 3 course go around at Spiaggia. I started with the testa which was delicate and very meaty. By meaty, I don't mean hearty, it wasn't, but the essence of the dish was to taste the meat and notice the texture of the loaf of the emulsified, thin cut meat. Next I had the veal angliotti, which are little envelopes of veal in a spectacular sauce. Simple and amazing. Next, I had the duck. The duck had a boneless breast, skin on and heavily crisped, with duck sausage and a bright fruit compote.The meal was spectacular. The bill wasn't small, but it was a great night out and a great celebration., The food tastes very good and of course the ambiance is nice, but I just felt massively ripped off the whole time. Spending $600 on a place and leaving hungry, leaves me angry (And I wasn't even the one paying!). Let New Yorkers obsessed with being seen with Obama come to this place and waste their money., 'Can I give six stars?My fellow Yelpers, I had, hands down, THE best dining experience of my life last weekend at Spiaggia. Need I say more? If you get the chance, you must, must, MUST go here.', Wonderful restaurant. The decor is beautiful. There's a mix of plants and giant marble ball's that seperate you from other guests. Plenty of space inbetween to not feel like your dining on top of one another. You're a couple floors off the street, so it's a view I have yet to experience elsewehre. The service has been impeccable the handful of times I've went. Spiaggia's actually got me into fromage, they had a gentlemen come out with the cheese cart our first time we visited. Since then, I've become a huge fan of the worlds variety of cheeses. The food is in a class of it's own. You're going to pay top dolla, but the food will leave you soulfully satisfied and you'll be talking about your experience for years to come. If you want to avoid the French fine dinding scene, give Spiaggia a go. You wont be dissapointed. I recommend getting a 5-7 course pri fixe, skip the truffle upgrade. Not worth the hype., 'If you rate this restaurant high, then I bet your last Italian meal was at Olive garden. Decoration is totally artificial (a feeling of being aboard a cruise ship) and service is slow although admittedly fairly good once the waiter decides to finally stop by. The food is mediocre at best: decent presentation but taste offers nothing beyond what you would get in a precooked pack in the froze aisle. This can only be a self rated 4 star restaurant.', 'Went there with my girl friend and 4 other friends Saturday night and found inattentive, condescending and  don bother me kind of attitude from our server. My wine didn come until I asked for it again at dinner, and the food was salty and overcooked. I would not recommend this place for friends or client.', Spiaggia is definitely a solid and classy choice for upscale Italian dining in our fair city. Trust me, I pay homage most certainly where it is due. Which is why I've held off for some time on reviewing this spot since my first visit there didn't do a whole lot to bowl me over... the food was incredibly tasty, but the dd9cor, clientele and overall vibe just came across a bit... well, old. My group was the youngest in there by far - a mix of late twenties and early thirties - and I literally felt the staff almost collectively cringe when we walked in. True, we weren't all clad in Sperry Topsiders, but were there just as any other upscale patron would be; enthusiastic foodies on a mission to spend some hard-earned, young and upwardly mobile dough! This first experience may have left a slight bad taste in my mouth, even if my sheep's milk ricotta filled ravioli with lamb pancetta, shallots, tomato and mint pesto did not... I was, however, certainly glad to have a crack at a second round via business dinner and (hopefully) prove myself wrong - Spiaggia really is a dining force to be reckoned with and not just a culinary has-been still basking in it's days of yore... I still stand by my previous statement that the dd9cor is a bit tired... likely better suited for the more 'mature' crowd they seem to draw, I personally prefer a far less conservative atmosphere. The big burgundy leather booths and dark, worn carpet did nothing but help me reminisce about my childhood dinners at Hamburger Hamlet. Eh... at least the menu strongly makes up for what they lack in forward design. And with that said, on to some food! Tasty, Delicate, Delicious, Flavorful, Phenomenal! These are dishes for a connoisseur of cooking! Not a bad dish in the house... I've sampled from the regular dining menu and the tasting menu alike, you can't go wrong with either, really. Spiaggia's take on Italian is like nothing I've had previously... to say it's inventive would be a gross understatement. For example... why have a basic caesar salad when you can delight your senses with a warm salad of cardoons, salsify, and baby leeks with creamy fontina, quail egg and crispy focaccia. See what I mean?! Thinking you'll go for a nice plate of spaghetti and meatballs? Not when you can devour hand rolled potato gnocchi with ricotta sauce and Umbrian black truffle -or- hand crafted garganelli with San Marzano tomatoes, Pantellerese capers and house cured sardines... you really would be a meatball to pass up these delectable morsels... Uh Oh. Sorry... I needed to take a break and wipe my keyboard from all that drool... I'm back in fighting form now! Trust me, your expectations for dining well here should be met 20x over... I, for one, know their orange blossom honey lacquered duck breast with duck sausage, rapini and creamy yellow polenta is nothing short of sensational... crispy, sweet, velvety, savory and melt-in-your-mouth fabulous, I can't say enough about the perfection of this dish. Desserts like warm chocolate-filled crepes and lemon panna cotta with polenta cookie and Meyer lemon vodka really round out the menu with simplicity, delicacy and class... it's hard not to be amazed at the conclusion of a meal like this, almost makes slightly haughty staff totally dismissible, doesn't it? Spiaggia will never be my chosen destination to reveal a new gorgeous dress in a fabulously chic setting, but it will be my go-to for the best Italian, make-your-mouth-water dishes outside of Tuscany. Benvenuti nella bella vita!! Welcome to the good life!!, My girlfriend's parents treated us to a dinner at Spiaggia this weekend and it was fantastic (especially since we didn't have to pick up the bill). For my first course I had the wood roasted rabbit loin, which was fantastic. For my pasta course I had the gnocchi with black truffles which was the best gnocchi I've ever had. And to finish it off I had the lamb loin. It was good, but I felt that the pasta course was the strongest of the three.This place is expensive, but its great for a special occasion, or if someone else is picking up the bill. heh., 'My GF and I had a fantastic dinner at Spiaggia a couple nights ago. It hit all the high points for me. Great interior, fantastic decor and vibe, love the huge windows in the front and the multiple tiers of seating. Everyone has a great view yet it still felt intimate and not crowded.Service was solid, although it was a weeknight and I think they were just a little under-staffed they still handled everything well. Would have liked a few more suggestions from the server but I think she was new. The wine list is exceptional. Everything you could want from Italy and more. Very helpful and fun descriptions of many of the offerings makes the list a fun read.And the food...Wow! As others have noted, there are some simply unforgettable dishes such as the gnocchi with black truffles which is amazing! The sturgeon capellini was silly fresh, the diver scallops were perfectly cooked and the duck was divine. I would recommend that if you are average eaters and want to maximize your tour of the menu, order two antipastis, two first courses and share a second course. We did that and were perfectly sated, if not a little full!For me, this is without a doubt one of the top four or five restaurants in Chicago. Next time, we are going to try the tasting menu. I cannot wait!', Spiaggia is by far my favorite restaurant in Chicago. For a special occasion, you can't go wrong. The service is impeccable and the food is a culinary dream come true. I had my wedding here in the private dining room, and people still to this day remark how amazing the menu was. We went back for our 1-year anniversary. You are treated like royalty and I highly recommend the chef's tasting menu. You get to try so many courses and pair them with different wines. The atmosphere is so beautiful, you can look out over Michigan Avenue and Lake Michigan. Definitely an experience I hope to have again., Ok, I'll admit it. I came in last fall after all the hype re: the obamas celebrating their anniversary here. The chef's tasting menu plus wine pairings clocked in at ~$250, and there was a seasonal white truffle supplement for +$70.The truffles were perfectly matched with the dishes, and took the famed gnocchi dish to legen...wait for it...dary status.Stars are for the food. decor and service were good - not great. The overall experience was quite nice. -1 point because I just don't see it at quite the same level as other restaurants at this price point.|1
49|spqr-san-francisco|Talk about a not so quiet opening. From the crew that brought you A16, SPQR was bustling with people at prime dinner time, with the wait for two being up to an hour. However we were really good about hawking the bar area which is first come first serve and landed a prime spot in from of the open kitchen. We were fortunate to be sitting next to a couple in the industry and they seemed to know all the staff. They gave us some insights on what they tried and even gave us a sample of their desserts. Talk about a great way to start off!Since we were catching the Paolo Nutini show, it was fitting that we would be going Italian all the way for the night, including the way we structured dinner with antipasti, first course, then second course. Food taken in as follows:Antipasti:Bay scallops with drid tomatoes, tropea onions and breadcrumbsMozzarella in carroza with anchoviesSalt CodFirst Course:Fusilli with zuchhini, chiles, and ricotta salataSecond Course:Pork SaltimboccaBeef shortrins alla vaccinaraThe antipasti come as mini plates of $7 for one, $18 for three, and $28 for five. The salt cod was lightly battered then fried, unlike the expected baccalau which is usually whipped with potatoes. Still tasty nonetheless. The bay scallops were great little morsels well balanced with the tanginess of the tomatoes and crisp texture of crumbs. The mozzarella in carroza got a contemporary touch to it; plated like mini mozzarella grilled cheeses with a dab of anchovy sauce on top. If you've had traditional corraza, it's usually a loaf of bread hollowed out, filled with mozzarella, battered and deep fried. Then it's topped with either a tomato basil sauce or an anchovy sauce (try Caffe Sorrento:NYC or Palermo:Elk Grove, CA if you haven't). This can be a meal in intself, but as all the antipasti we saw, this followed in the bite sized category. Our industry bar neighbor was noting to us that all of the pastas were made in house and that they were particularly impressed that they had fusilli since most restaurants won't make the investment for the corkscrew shaped die. I'm not a huge fan of zucchini but we got it anyways and were impressed with the flavors and textures of the pasta and cheese. The ricotta was super fresh and had a nice salty kick to partner with the fusilli. Since I didn't touch the zucchini I won't comment but I was told it was cooked well and the chiles gave it a nice heat.The saltimbocca seemed to be a ham like cutlet which was topped with prosciutto, crisped on both sides on a gridle with a press, then garnished with fried sage. I love smoked pork products and to combine the two this was was a win-win. The vaccinara is usually done with oxtails, but the short ribs version here presented a dish that was less work and more meat, which was great to me. It was absolutely fork tender in a stew of wine, tomato, carrots and various other herbs. Since I'm doing comparisons, if you want a similar dish try the oxtail stew at any self respecting Cuban place and you'll get a good Latin parallel.As mentioned earlier the place was wall to wall patrons. People were in the hallway, they were on the sidewalk, everywhere. One guy actually at at the bar alone while he had his two kids sit by a table by the restrooms! We got to talking to the line chefs when they got a breather and commented on the fact that they were moving a million miles an hour with basically no major faults. They said they had a two or three things that came back but overall it was a great night. It was a very well run, tight kitchen. I think the space honestly is meant for three but there were always at least five, with the preps and expediter (Exec Chef Nate Appleman himself) filling in as needed. At some points one of the line chefs had all the burners and all the pasta cages going. Definitely a sight to behold. In addition to the friendliness of the cooks, the hostess, bartender and the rest of the wait and management staff were super friendly. Great way to debut.I'm was waffling at 4.5 stars for a while because I know some people would probably get frustrated by the wait but since we got lucky and got the seating that we did and the experience that we did, I'm just going to have to give them the whole shebang. Excellent opening. I just hope it slows down a bit so that people don't come in and get discouraged by a mandatory one hour wait., 'SPQR: Senatus Populusque Romanus , or The Senate and the Roman People. Seen all over Rome, from statues to coins to documents.Good name for a Roman restaurant.', Ate at SPQR last night with my husband and some friends and the food was incredible. I love how the menu allows you to order 5 appetizers for $28 - it really gives you an opportunity to try many of the wonderful dishes. We had the shelling beans with some sort of pork ragu, the fried sweetbreads, the grilled pecorino, the frittata, and the fresh mozzarella bocconcini...all were excellent but I can't stop thinking about those shelling beans! We had the carbonara spaghetti and the amatriciana rigatoni (they make their pastas in house and they were perfectly al dente), and for our entrees, we had the lamb, the cuttlefish, the short ribs and the pork sausage and quail. And if that wasn't enough, for dessert, we had the almond milk granita and the panino. The panino is essentially a buttery grilled panini filled with pears and topped with shaved chocolate and sea salt. I never considered myself a real dessert person, but I pretty much ate the entire thing - I think I may have even growled at my friends when they tried to take a bite of my panino! The restaurant has a homey feel and the service was very good. I am really picky about service and admit that I am probably a total pain in the neck customer, but our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and offered some great recommendations.Definitely check out SPQR when you have a chance. It's crowded and you'll probably have to wait awhile for a table, but put your name down, order a glass of wine or go down to Harry's and have a drink and come back for some really yummy Italian grub., 'Another excleent restaurant now added to upper Fillmore. this place is head and shoulders above Chez Nous and IMHO, better than A16.I ahd their scallop starter, whcih was excelelnt and the cuttlefish, which is to die for.Thanks for bringing another great restaurant into my neighborhood and repetoire', Yay! How happy am I to live up the street from SPQR?! Very. We popped in on opening night and walked away with big smiles.The service was perfect, the food super-delicious. It can be a bit heavy... but perhaps that was our fault for ordering a lot... Is five apetizers, two main dishes and dessert too much for two people?? We thought maybe as we were ordering, but it didn't stop us from eating it all. The scallops starter was delish, as was the fritata and the warm mozarella starter. For mains, the Saltimboca was out of this world while the Carbonara spaghetti was a touch too al-dente. That small disappointment aside, everything else here made my mouth water -- including the panino dessert.Welcome to the neighborhood, SPQR! We're happy you're here!, Great AmbianceGreat ServiceGreat Pinot GrigioNot -so- great- bread that arrived pre meal--dry w/ no dipping sauce/no butter/no olive oil...best to dip the bread in the Great Mozzarella ball cold appetizer...loved the ballsNot- so- great- pasta entree...described to have ham like meat w/ tomatoes...so my Jewish friend visiting from Israel who doesn't touch pork, grabbed his fork to determine if ham was in the pasta--going against his Kosher diet, he tried my entree...NO PORK!! whew...at least he kept Kosher;)The waitress was puzzled when she looked at my dish and didn't see the meat as she described....so she brought the dish back to the kitchen, the chef relayed the message to our table that the ham-like meat is used as a sauce base...nothing like how the waitress described the meal.....the waitress was embarrassed to have inaccurately described the entree.....I was still craving meat and disappointed w/ the pasta, so the waitress suggested that I order the veal cutlet w/ prosciutto topping...sounds perfect! Love at first site, but NOT love at first bite--this piece of meat was way over done....quite frankly salt on a hockey puck would taste the same...so once again the waitress headed to the kitchen--the chef agreed and apologized...The manager came to the table to discuss...they were receptive to suggestions and open to comments, this was handled perfectly!!We passed on dessert-although the menu was appealing-- called it a night of Pinot Grigio drinking and diving my fork into my friends bland pasta dish...el dente was the only thing the chef did correct tonight!! I will give this place another try--but next time for brunch/lunch--can't mess up breakfast of champions can you?...time will tell! Thanks for the customer service! See you for brunch!, this is my very first review on yelp - so exciting! i've been a loyal reader of yelp for a long time, but i've never actually written anything. the reason i got online this morning and finally signed up on yelp is because i went to spqr last night and had such a great meal that i wanted to get online and share. (although i also sorta want to keep it a secret because it is already so crowded!!) i would like to give it 4 1/2 stars but i'm not sure how..? my friend and i got there at 6:15pm and the place was already bumping we had to wait about 20-25 minutes, but it wasn't too bad. that is one of the only problems there - no space to wait for your table. you either wait in the cold or wait inside, standing awkwardly between already crowded tables. most importantly - the meal! we shared everything. we started with 2 of the appetizers: the shelling beans with pork and the scallops with sun dried tomatoes and crispy breadcrumbs - both were fabulous! next came the pasta - the spaghetti carbonara - which was so yummy - the pasta is made from scratch and it's obvious - so fresh and cooked al dente. last we had the beef, which had amazingly sweet sliced tomatoes, basil, pickled radishes and shaved peccorino....yum! i'm not even a big steak fan, but it was thin, perfectly cooked and very tender. unfortunately we didn't save room for dessert, but hopefully next time. the wine: we each had some wine as well, i love how you can get a taste, a glass, a carafe or a bottle. really great choices and shelly the sommelier (she must split her time between there and a16?) is so wonderful. she came right over to us as we were looking over the wine list and made a couple great recommendations. she is so approachable, easy going and clearly knowledgeable without being pretentious. i wish every sommelier could be like her.the only other thing they need to figure out is how to keep the cold air out! we were sitting close to the door and every time the door opened a blast of cold air would rush in. maybe a curtain or something would help. we were not the only ones who were cold, i could tell the people around us were getting annoyed with the cold air too. bottom line: great place, excellent food, fun scene and the staff is awesome. it's already running like a well oiled machine! things to work on: curtain to hold out the cold air and better bread (it wasn't as good as a16, and bring olive oil or butter for the bread)., 'I really wanted to like the place, but the food was surprisingly bland! Maybe we came in with our expectations too high?Bread came with olive oil. The olive oil was really good! The bread wasn anything to write home about and, in fact, seemed day old.Antipasto: bocconcini marinated in olive oil and olives, I think. It was OK. More olive-y than mozzarella-y.I thinking we should have had more antipasti because they easily dominate the menu with 3 categories (hot, cold, fried) with several dishes in each, and maybe this is where SPQR shines.1st course: Steve J. had the carbonara, which he gave an eh. Granted, he had the best carbonara he ever had in Rome earlier this year, so he ruined for life. I had the spaghetti amatriciana. Bland, but the homemade pasta was nice.2nd course: I had the lamb. Pan-fried! Good! And huge! Steve had the pork saltimbocca, which he thought was over-cooked.Service was perfect, which was especially impressive since it a tight, small space and it wall-to-wall bodies. Speaking of tight and small, we were sat at a table behind the bar, which was unfortunate, because some lady lacy underwear-clad butt was hanging out of her jeans, and that just about at face-level. Yum!It new and shiny and exciting, but it was really noisy and the staff whooshing around and I felt a bit of a sensory overload. I think SPQR works best as a small plates & wine after work kind of thing.', I've been eagerly anticipating this restaurant opening for months now. I live right around the corner and was very excited to have a great Italian restaurant so close. I can honestly say that I was crushed at how average, and that's being kind, this place was. The menu itself looks great. Lots of good options and it's relatively inexpensive. We ordered three different starters and they were all average at best. I ordered the spaghetti amatraciana and my wife had the spaghetti alio e olio, probably the most basic pasta combination out there. Both were incredibly bland. Amatraciana has guanciale (pancetta) in it and if anything, sometimes it can be too salty. In this case, I found myself adding salt multiple times. I'm still not even sure they included the guanciale in there. As for my wife's spaghetti with olive oil and garlic, pretty much the same thing. There was very little oil in there, no red pepper flakes (as was mentioned on the menu) and no parsley. The only thing you could taste was cheese. We thought that maybe it was just us but the two tables next to us experience the same thing. One woman had to ask the waitress if her dish was meant to be served cold (it wasn't). My hope is that these problems are due to it being a new restaurant. I'll wait a month and give it another shot., We were expecting a wait and not in that much of a hurry to eat so accepted the 1 1/2 hour wait. We pleasantly enjoyed a very nice glass of wine and beer. To say the place was packed is an understatement!The hostess though was very kind and checked in on us while we were waiting. Seeing all the food pouring out the kitchen wetted our appetites.When we were finally seated we ordered the carbonara, chicken livers, scallops, croquettes, and tuna salad. All the dishes were pleasant except we had to send back the carbonara because it was cold when we got it.The food was good but not worth the extended wait. With a myriad of dining options around the hood probably won't be coming back., Went there a week after it opened. The pasta is PHENOMENAL. Also, incredible value overall. Servers were very friendly and knowlegeable eventhough they were still getting the hang of it. I also LOVE the kitchen bar seating (although we did not sit there). The no-reservations policy is a mixed blessing - I love to eat late so for me its great, but if you don't like to wait and you want prime time then it makes it harder, I think they should do a 50/50 mix of res and non-res. Sweetbreads app was amazing and the fried ricotta was our favorite. Wine list was very interesting, but I needed help as its a bit too 'non-mainstream' for me, but my server recommended exactly the right wine. Definitely a high recommendation!, So terribly disappointed with the food at this very new, very crowded, very popular restaurant. The food is boring and sadly, not well prepared. We ordered three starters. The green beans were limp and soggy. If they were fresh, you would not have known it. The scallops were tasty, but a tad overcooked. Fortunately, the roasted potatoes were good. As far as the main courses went he spaghetti was UNDERCOOKED to the extent that it stuck to your teeth when you chewed it. The sauce however, was fine. The lamb was tough, tough, tough, and we were given butter knives to cut it. This restaurant has managed to cram what appears to be 25% more tables than when the space was a quieter, more quaint Chez Nous. As a result, tables are literally 2 inches away from each other, and the noise level is very high. Be prepared to shout across the table here.The service was a little spotty, but maybe that will change once they work the kinks out, but the food just isn't worth returning back for., This place is packed and gets LOUD. Definitely head here with no more than 4 people that can drink lots of wine and share food. This is the kind of place where you want to drink excellent wines and nibble on various dishes with a few folks. The starters are really good and easy to share. The pasta carbonara was yummie, but the braised pork shoulder didn't blow me away (it's sliced where I thought I would be able to pull it apart). Anyhow - this place is worth heading to if you are in the mood to 1- drink wine and 2- eat... in that order., 'Went here last night for dinner. Our server was really, really nice, but food seemed pretty slow to come out. And the appetizers we ordered were just okay, bordering on slightly disappointing. BUT our entrees were absolutely perfect and definitely made up for everything else. I had the calamari which was delicious and my friend had the lamb which she said was, cooked to perfection. They do not take reservations and for a Wednesday night they were still jam packed. As we were eating, I heard the hostess telling people it was an hour and a half wait for a table (note: we showed up at 6:30pm and had no trouble being seated). Another thing I liked is that I never felt rushed like they were trying to get us out. Overall, I liked this place and also thought the prices seem very fair for what youe getting.', Today I had a pretty great brunch at SPQR. It was not your standard omelettes, potatoes, and pancakes fare, but more along the lines of italian cheeses, sauces, pastas, polenta... chicken livers. After traveling along the Adriatic this summer I have to say that the flavor of one of the egg dishes I tried was dead on. The service was also super friendly and attentive. I will definitely return to SPQR, but only if I'm in the mood for straight up italian., Despite the long wait for dinner, (an hour) this new joint on Fillmore has savory italian fare. Our waitress, who recently relocated to SF from the Midwest, was attentive and pleasant. Interesting Italian wine list that nicely complements the cuisine. I would echo the other reviewers' comments on the space. It's tight as its predecessor, Chez Nous., Que fantastico, You should sit by the bar as you can't hear much but you can see everything happeing. The sommalier is the most charming woman around and there's noen of that creepy upselling so prevalent in restaurants today. The owners are young hip and literally constructed the place with theri own hands and thats' something I appreciate. My favorite dish? the Beans with pork yumminess. Make a point of stopping by., This guys know what they're doing! The atmosphere is warm and inviting. The wine list is made by an artist, with exclusively Italian delicious wines. The food is simple but at the same time taste fresh and genuine.Perfect place to bring a date, or just go by yourself and sit at the bar...you'll end up talking about wine with the bartender.Ah, I almost forgot, delicious dessert (I had the almond granita) to finish your meal!, Meh, just not that great or memorable. We'll try again in about 6 months., I'll admit I am somewhat tardy in writing this review, based on the fact that I had dinner here oh, about a month ago. I'll admit, I wasn't inspired to go home and yelp. And that's because SPQR is flat-out uninspiring.I know, how could that be, coming from the people behind A16. A16, while moderately overrated (why you still have to book weeks in advance is beyond me), still turns out high-quality, very tasty food appropriate to the region after which it's named. Wouldn't SPQR be the same?Sadly, no. While the good ingredients are there, and the food may be vaguely Roman, there is one very important thing missing: flavor. Why did everything we ordered taste so... boring? And it's not like we chose poorly: both our starters were based on fatty pork products (confit and housemade sausage)! How is it even possible that they were so... blah? That seemed a danger for the delicately-flavored zucchini/ricotta involtini, but this combo blew both pork dishes out of the water. Pork confit and high-quality sausage should hit you over the head with their unctuous, heady (for the former) and primal, salty (for the latter) deliciousness. They should not get beat down by some raw squash.I was hit with the disappointing realization that the kitchen doesn't treat the pig right. This was an especially bad realization given that we had carbonara coming. I love carbonara. And it's is allegedly one of SPQR's signatures. And they allegedly make it with guanciale, the holy grail of cured pork products that is unfortunately quite hard to come by.Apparently it's hard to come by for professional chefs too, because I could not detect any in my dish. Nor was there much of anything else - cracked black pepper, pecorino. No creamy sauce formed by incorporating egg yolk, pork fat and cheese. It was basically a dish of noodles. Very toothsome, delicious noodles, but noodles nonetheless. I hate to use an Emeril-ism, but the kitchen needed to kick this dish up about 10 notches.The meal did have two saving graces: the sweet, eager-to-please service and the wine list. Very well-edited list, proper stemware, proper serving temps: I sense there's not a bad sip on there. The decor is noticeably missing from this list of saving graces, and that's because there isn't much to speak of. It has the exact same boring shoebox look and feel of Chez Nous, except with some dark wood paneling hastily pasted partway up the walls. If the food were great, who cares, but dull food in a dull room does not a fun night make. Especially when forced to wait over an hour for the privilege.But maybe things have improved. Maybe now the kitchen has discovered salt. And pepper. And found the missing guanciale. And maybe, based on rumors of mediocrity, the crowds have dissipated and an immediate table can be had. But until then, I'm just not inspired to return., All the cozy comfort of Chez Nous, much better food. Sat at the Chef's counter, where we met the chef and watched all the amazing concoctions come together. Everything we had was great, from the starters (Peppers and eggplant, Shelled beans, and fried broccocini) to the meals of Lasagne and Rigatoni Carbonara. Simple, delicious, and surprisingly affordable., used to come here whe it opened & it was really good!! (4*)Heard that the chef quitted & i tried to came again 1 night, it was busy as usual. The food didn't taste as i expected. I ordered some side dishes the cualiflower was too cooked & oily it made me kind of sick after...Tried the pasta tromphe it didnt tasted as goood asa 1sttime went there. I wouldn't come back anymore Im sorry won't waste my time & $$ in here., Really not a bad place. Probably worth checking out, but I'm going to stick to A-16 for a few reasons.  No reservations on a Friday night can be tedious. Yes, seating was surprisingly quick, but when the bar offers very little space for waiting you may find yourself stepping on your date's toes. Sorry again. Average food. Of the antipasti, the homemade sausages were good. The fried pumpkin was bland and oily (should let it sit in a paper towel to absorb the oil). The mozzarella balls were good, but nothing special (could find this in a sports bar). The shortribs were delicious, but if you told me I was eating beef stew I wouldn't have thought twice. The rigatoni was good, but also, like the mozzarella balls, nothing to write home about. Parking...ummm, nevermind. Parking sucks whether it's Pacific Heights or the Marina but it just seems worse in PH.But there were many positives to SPQR. The service was friendly and prompt, as well as conscientious. The wine selection was diverse enough, but I honestly don't know much about Italian wines so I was at a loss. If you live nearby, it probably works as a nice neighborhood restaurant., 'mediocre' sums up our experience at SPQR. we got 5 antipasti and some pasta. the chantrelles were especially greasy with a funky rancid oil taste. the fried mozzarella (suppli al telefono) was not warm enough to be 'stringy like telephone wires'. the rest were unmemorable. the pasta in the spaghetti carbonara had a nice texture, but the sauce was also greasy and overdone. it took over 1.5 hours for the 4 of us to be seated from the original 6:30pm estimate of '1 hour' on saturday night. simply not worth the wait. we won't be back...., 'mehhhh bordering on Y_ _ K...what does SPQR have to do with ITALIAN? Super PRICEY Qu_ _ _ Restaurant? Pulease...The prices are outrageous for what is represented by their photo-copied menu as locally sourced and SUSTAINABLE produce, meat and fish whenever possible. Why not just get the best from the best? All food should be SUSTAINABLE..it is not a petro-chemical product consumable by urban dwellers. ..Well, the small multi choice ideas is akin to a Italianate version of TAPAZINO..Antipasti choices of three for $18, five for $28...ok...olive, almonds and marinated carrots, stracciatell..egg drop soup...potatoes w. garlic tomatoes..MEZZO MEZZO...I love Blue Bottle coffee, but even the capuccino...was again..mezzo mezzo...the wine we had was fine...Moscato form Piemonte...$70 for two...next time if I have a craving I will recommend CASSIS on Steiner and Sutter, dinner, for the upscale neighborhood place, which is more Southern French, but worth the time and effort....Sorry, folks...I was looking for a pleasant replacement for Chez Nous and you don really hit the spot for the upper scale prices...(for Italian maybe try Via VENETO on Fillmore/Clay)..hey, QUINCE...if only we had made reservations in advance...oh well....', Ok so when you pay $60 plus for a meal, you don't expect to be eating a slice of pizza a mere few hours later. But that was my sad story on my first visit to this Fillmore street newcomer. This, despite ordering three small appetizers to share plus a pasta dish. The wine list was ok, as was the service. I have to say the best part about the place was probably the fact they serve Blue Bottle coffee. The french press is quite good and the perfect caffeine boost needed to continue to the next destination!, I really enjoyed this restaurant. I decided to check it out after reading the review in JuliB (julib.com/sanfrancisco/l43_), since it mentioned my two favorite things: good wine, and food that's fried but actually tasty. The fried artichokes alone were worth the (rather long) wait!, 'Number of times attempted to dine at SPQR: 3Number of times actually dined at SPQR: 1SPQR is walk-in only, in the sense that youl walk in, put your name down, be told the wait an hour, and walk back out. What up with that? I don think an hour wait for a table every night, except Mondays when few people choose to dine out, is acceptable. Especially in a neighborhood where the only bar where you could potentially sit and wait for that table is the grown-up-Marina-boys-yelling-sports-bar-by-day-clubbey-club-by-night, Harry. So while SPQR is a great place to go with the girlfriends and gab over small plates and a couple glasses of wine, youl find yourself wandering Fillmore street for the hour, wondering what the hell to do with yourselves.But yeah, we walked in on a Monday to SPQR (which I will now be forced to call speaker because S P Q R is a mouthful and pretentious) and did manage to get a table at the bar counter. The place itself isn all that pretentious at all. In fact, the decor is fantastic - high ceilings, warm tones, classy textures, and no bullshit.You can choose from a variety of small plates, all of which sound pretty exciting, and come out tasting quite delectable as well. No dish stood out as mind-blowing, but small plates always make for a fun and social night out. The wine list is plentiful, and the staff is pretty knowledgeable when it comes to helping you choose.All in all, an acceptable dining experience, despite not taking reservations.', 'Stopped in here on Halloween to be seated next to a couple dressed as a Metro-Greasy Jersey Scuzzball and a Referee-Slut. Pretty sure the second was a costume, at least. Pretty sure.As for the food: middling quality fresh and fine pasta. Tried the aglio e olio and the broccoli rabe preparations. Aglio e olio was more boring than subtle - it was leaning hard on slight pepper flavoring. The broccoli rabe dish (trompeta pasta) fared better, but not a stunner.And that it for vegetarian pasta dishes. So if you don dig on swine, good luck.Atmosphere: buzzing and tight. Cheesy (rather than kitschy) music in the extreme - my memory is failing me for specifics, but I thinking Bon Jovi and Sammy Hagar couldn be too far off.Price: moderate for what it is (maybe pricy given the small portions). But taking account of the quality and scene, it NOT WORTH IT.', Went on a Monday night and got a table for 5 immediately - which apparently is rare on any other day besides Monday. Anyway - split 5 antipasto dishes, each ordered a pasta, split two carafes of wine and two desserts - under $40/pp. The antipasto dishes were excellent - especially the brussel sprouts - who knew?! Pasta dishes were all great except I agree with other reviews that the portions are a bit on the small side. Which I didn't really mind too much - I'd rather leave a restaurant comfortable than with a food baby growing insde me. It's intimate, it's cozy - service was casual but impressive. Love the location too., 'To say the place was packed is an understatement. Packed, packed, packed. And all those people are there for a reson -- this place is good!!SPQR offers multitudes of hot and cold Roman antipasti -- from chicory salad with anchovy and marinated beets with fresh ricotta to grileld pecorino (How do you make cheese better? Fry it!!) and house-made pork sausage with lentiils. If those are not enough, you can treat yourself to house-made pasta or other hot entrees, including local calamari with ceci beans and roasted lamb with rosemary.The well-executed dishes are complemented, by a nicely priced wine list that includes 3 oz tastes, glasses, carafes, and many bottles.You don;t have to go to Italy for great Italian food (the dollar sucks against the euro anyway ...). Just go to Fillmore Street.', SPQR could also be Succulent Pasta, Quenching Red...(OK, it's a lousy attempt but at least I tried to play with the letter Q...)It works out great for the bums like us who get to eat at such cool neighborhood restaurants for lunch during the week. Sorry (sort of) for all of you who write reviews about how hard it was to get a table: the place was about half full.The pasta, amazing. The service, terrific. The wine, well chosen.AND (big AND), my baby boy, almost one year old, ate a whole meal there, nothing prepared by mum this time. He loved the pumpkin, the pasta with broccoli, and the pasta with short ribs. This kid is going to have expensive tastes the way we are getting him started.The neighborhood needed a place like this!, exemplary of the kind of establishment i love and will always return to. handsome sleek decor, sexy bar, lovely table settings (heathware ceramics and clever recycled beer bottles for drinking glasses!), somewhat understated, and most importantly, DAMN FINE FOOD. every dish is worth a try. some are good, and others will knock you on your ass. the only drawback is the small cramped space, but in a way it works in SPQR's favor., 'We ended up at this warm, cozy and friendly joint quite unexpectedly and were pleasantly surprised by the heart-warming Piedmonte wine and the five tapas style small dishes.I was most impressed by the service, the courteous staff and the comfortable atmosphere created here.Coffee was great and the sorbet was just right: a touch to cleanse the palate.', 'Had a really good dinner on Thursday night. It was an early one, 6:15pm, and already busy with a lively atmosphere. Food was excellent! I did think it was slightly over priced, because I would have preferred a little larger portions for the price, but I would definitely forgo that, to keep it as tasty and fresh. Service was outstanding and really made us feel at home. It was so good, I even forgot about running in to my wifes ex and family :-)', Let's see....(warning: this is going to be vague)We sat at the counter and watched the kitchen. It was a very good time over all. You can order five small plates for something like 27 dollars. I thought that was very exciting, although it makes it hard to recall everything we tried. Some of it was good, some of it was great.My favorite part was the wine list, my man ordered a great bottle of red, but I wanted a bit of white to start. They have wines by the glass and the half glass which is great for non-committers like myself. The one I remember is the Erbaluce, it was remarkable.I want to go again before this place gets insane. Because they don't take resos I am going to assume that after it takes off it will be a challenge, we shall see.(Oh btw, does anyone know how to pronounce their name? or do you spell it out? cause that's a bit cumbersome, if you know what I mean.), 'Delicious! Walked in after having had dinner just to sample the menu. We were pleasantly surprised to find traditional Italian plates such as sweet breads, tripe (ala Romana?), octopus, prosciutto and chicken livers. All ranged from fantastic to very good for a price of $28. And with two sparking wines, the meal proved to be quite a value. I highly recommend SPQR. Great and friendly service.', yum.wait, let me say it again with more enthusiasm: YUM!based on my experiences at chez nous, i thought this place was going to be fairly similar; small plates and mediocre. but alas, i was so wrong, and for the better.this is italian. like really italian. northern cuisine REPRESENT. southern cuisine REPRESENT. sweetbreads and grilled octupi REPRESENT. i loved it. the hostess was the real deal. didn't force me to sit at a table (no reservations taken folks) and didn't shove me to the bar even though i was a tad bit early for my dinner plans with my recently engaged friend.i sat at the bar with a really nice and warm fellow who had transferred from A16's line. very knowledgable about italian white wines and steered me towards the g. cechi southern italian white. pure deliciousness by the glass. when my friend arrived, we decided to do the $18 antipasti sampler: roasted peppers, tuna and celery salad and beet and cheese. then we split a spaghetti with pecorino with black pepper. yum! what a few ingredients can do to make a fresh pasta taste so good, i'm not sure, but it was damn tasty.eat here. prices are kind of high, but still reasonable. space is limited, but still very intimate and fun. give the fresh pastas a go, and do the antipasti samplers. say YUM with me. say it again. and again. and again., Absolutely Divine! No joke, I really cannot say enough wonderful things about this place. My fiance and I stopped in a few nights ago to check out the new spot, recomended by a friend. I kid you not, we felt like we were on Iron Chef, sampling as many small plates as humanly possible (DO NOT pass on the fried brussel sprouts! I also loved the Beets & Ricotta while he loved the homemade sausage App) The Wine our waitress suggested matched our entire meal wonderfully. And please Save Room for Dessert even if you don't like dessert. Trust me. We go out to eat alot. I'm talking almost every day alot. And SPQR ranks high, very high on both of our lists. Enjoy!, UPDATED: Ok so I just got an email from a rep at the restaurant that their pricing is indeed 3 apps for 18 or 1 app for 7. So we just were unlucky and overcharged. We ordered 3 apps for $18 and our bill said 2X18. Anyhow if this is the case I find the prices to be reasonable. However I am still miffed we got overcharged. So three stars it is! _________________________________________________Be careful when you go here. The menu says that you can order appetizers $7 each or $18 for 3. Sounds super cheap.... Then you get the bill and realize that it is $7 X2 or $18X2! I guess if you are a party of five its $7X5 for one appetizer??? Doesn't make any sense? And also if you go by your self is it 7X2 for one person??? Other than my complaint about the unclear and weird pricing at this place the food was excellent. I would suggest the butter beans they were the best item on the menu. For value I would order just a pasta dish because these range between $12-15 and not times the amount of people you have in your party. We had an excellent server but the hostess was a bit grumpy. I would probably go back and I hope they address their weird pricing seems really ridiculous to pay $7 X2 for a small plate of butter beans., 'Seriously what is the hype about this place? Ie been dying to try this new local Italian spot that replaced my beloved Chez Nous :(  I mean Ie heard good things, so I was excited to try A16 sister restaurant. With high hopes and hungry appetites, I headed to dinner at SPQR last nite~!W H A T A B U Z Z K I L L!The menu was limited. Very limited. Unless your big on pasta - they offer 7 or so. Along with 4 main courses - lamb, beef, pork and calamari. Uhh... no thanks. I not big on calamari. Nor was I feeling lamb, beef or pork for that matter. Con chicken. Why no chicken dish? Grr. So we just ordered the 5 appetizers for $28 bucks special and a couple glasses of wine. All 5 were rather unimpressive. Though I did like the butternut squash and onion dish, the other 4 were nothing special. Soup - not great, not bad, not worth ordering again.Olives and Prosciutto (sp?) - was exactly what it sounds like a few slices of cured ham and some olives out of a jar. LAME! note to self: never order again.Fried Peppers - not what I expected the 20 or so green peppers were just slighty fried. not deep fried in any sense of the word. they weren bad at all and if everything else didn suck I would have written off the mediocrity of this dish as interesting - another word for hmmm, wth?Celery and Tuna Salad - in pc terms this salad was weird. to make things more clear basically it was nasty. weird not really a complement especially for food. no one wants to eat weird food. the dish sucked. yuck! NEVER EVER order again!Overall, I miss Chez Nous. SPQR failed to meet my expectations. Won be heading back soon. Sooo not worth the wait! Oh but they do have bar hooks for your purse I LOVE when bars have hooks to hold your purse! Il have to go back sometime to re-try the menu. Il keep you posted.', 'My mom was visiting from NYC this past week for Thanksgiving and she had heard about this restaurant from a friend all the way on the East Coast. He had said SPQR had the best homemade pasta he had ever had, and he was right. While the wait can be long, the service was impeccable. The wine recommendation from our waitress (a supposedly Italian wine called Weingut Niklas...sounds German to me) was so great that I spent the next day trying to track it down! (no luck). After he learned word about his restaurant traveled 3,000 miles away, the chef, Daniel, came to our table to greet us and suprised me with a birthday treat. Talk about VIP treatment! Would absolutely recommend this restaurant, only suggestion for them would be to start taking reservations, and up the portion size!', 'UPDATE: Just went back tonight. Taking off a star cause it just didn wow me. The wine of course was good and so was the service. But the completely out of it hostess with no mostess and the ok-I-could-have-cooked-this-myself pasta, I just had to take down a star. Maybe next time I will stick the the antipasti. That seemed to work the first time around.---------------------------------------Here is my first review of SPQR at 4 stars.I lazy what can I say, I went to this restaurant within the first week of opening and am now finally getting to the review. Actually I wrote the review that first night I went, but for some reason or other never posted it. Anyway, here is what I wrote:So Roman huh? Well whatever they call it is fine by me, it was good Il even go so far as to say very good especially at those prices. 5 Antipasti for $28! They don take reservations yet so it a bit of a wait and I not sure I would wait again for that long, but first time and it opening week...yeah ok Il wait. We didn try any of the entrees so I will save that review for another time, but I will comment on the anti pasta. Wow for some and ewww for others (maybe personal choice here). Anyway, the fried potatoes were amazing. Ya know how sometimes you smell the sweet fried smell of a fair or a bakery? But than you go and try that sweet fried thing and it taste doesn even compare to the smell.....well, let me just say those fried potatoes lived up to the smell. Amazing! Another great dish was the scallops. The moment they entered my mouth I knew instantly what they reminded me of (but in a good way). They tasted extremely similar but oh so much better to the middle of a McDonald Hamburger. Ya know the stuff that on the hamburger. Sound strange? Well, I asked my brother what he thought about the scallops and if they reminded him of something. He said they were very good and yes they did remind him of something. I said the stuff on a McDonald hamburger? and he said oh my god your right!.', Dropped in on a rainy, blustery evening (6:30ish) for a glass of wine with a friend. Sat at the bar and chatted with Betsy, working behind the bar. Tried two excellent wines (and good pours) one from the Puglia region (SE Italy) and another from northern Italy. Enjoyed them both. Betsy asked if we wanted to see a menu, my friend passed and I thought I would check it out. I decided on a bowl of rigatoni Amatriciana. Wow. Excellent. It tasted like my G-ma's, who was born in the Puglia region. Al dente pasta (perfect), just the right amount of sauce and cheese, and great flavor. I offered a bite to my friend, hoping he wouldn't try it. Thankfully, he did not. Not a huge bowl, but, as Goldilocks would say, just right. It's the next day and I can still taste the sauce. Betsy was great, nothing to complain about, except maybe the price of the two glasses of wine. Maybe., I LOVED IT! This was a delicious dinner in a beautiful restaurant! We lucked out and new of the chef through a recommendation. He came to our table to tell us about the menu and was absolutely right on by saying everything on the menu was great! I can't wait to go back!, 'So I really liked SPQR, and think it a great companion place to A16 - the authenticity is great, and I love an Italian place that really nails the portions so you can have antipasti, pasta, and meat courses without feeling bloated.The Chef Bar seating would be more appealing if the chefs weren dressed like meathead San Bruno skate rats, but I just being superficial here - they were nice guys, and they made some good grub.We were there 6:30 on a Wed, seated right away though it did fill up by 7:30. The fried mozarella was outstanding (or, as the guy next to me said, a shitload better than Friday). The polenta was good (I have a thing for polenta, your mileage may vary). Sweetbreads were eh.The pasta was terrific - the lamb canelloni is alone worth the trip, and the trombette was also really good. perfect texture, blah blah blah. And the calamari entree was terrific.I still don think it has the calm urbanity of Pane e Vino, but then, I just realized I hated myself for typing the words calm urbanity, so there you go.', This is the kind of restaurant that should be a solid 4 star experience for me, but there were couple of key places where it failed. First off, I liked the cozy feel of the place. The lighting and the colors chosen for the decor contributes very much to a good food, good times glow. However, this was much diminished by a very long wait with very little done by the staff to encourage one of the tables to wrap up their post-dinner conversation so that we could sit down after waiting over half an hour. I've been on the other end, and know that it's not the greatest thing to be asked to leave a table...but I do think a restaurant staff needs to develop some subtle and tactful way of asking its patrons to vacate a table if other people have been waiting for so long (and no, these were not people still eating, but people who stayed at their table after their food was over for over half an hour). Once we finally managed to sit down, we shared some very delicious appetizers. The polenta with the pork soffrito is really delightful. SPQR gets their polenta from Anson Mills which is top of the line corn products. I've long wanted to taste an Anson Mills product after reading much about them. After tasting their polenta, I am considering seeing if I can order some grits. We also ordered the prosciutto with olives. The prosciutto was wispy thin and delightful.Main course: here's the other part that went wrong for me and warrants me giving SPQR 3 stars instead of 4. I ordered the fried Cornish Hen. Not yet having the experience of eating fried turkey, I thought this could be my shot at getting something similar. The skin on the Cornish Hen was crackling good, and the meat tender. However, once I struck closer to the bone, I realized that the meat was not fully cooked. I ate the portions of the Cornish Hen that were cooked and had the rest packed up to go. I like the dish and think that it's delicious. But it's not a good dining experience to be in fear of samonella. I hope SPQR perfects the cooking time necessary to cook the meat all the way through.Dessert: We shared their rice pudding (I forget what the name of it was in Italian), and it was really delicious. I said to my companion that this is what I would like to eat for breakfast every day. Not oversweet, but a wonderful warming bowl of soft rice overcooked in cream and milk. Absolutely recommended. So, I would return to SPQR without hesitation. But I hope they make some of the necessary adjustments to make the experience at this lovely restaurant a bit better., Have yet to try A16, but went here on their third night in business and sat at the bar, as there were no available tables. The fact that you can choose 5 different appetizers for a set price gives you the opportunity to try more items on the menu (the shelling beans were great, suppli al telefono a little on the salty side, may have been the cheese. Having lived in Rome for 2 years, I didn't find the food to be true Roman cuisine, but pretty damn close, maybe a little more gourmet. They have a great wine selection, good desserts, and impeccable service., 'Great service and atmosphere. Beautiful place. Very good wine list. Luckily got seated rght away on a Sat night. People who walked in right after us waited 20-30 mins. Food was good, but nothing special. Will go back for the overall good dining experience. We had a great waitress.', I had a *great* time at SPQR! We went on a Tuesday evening at 7pm. The place was full. So, we waited for about 10 minutes to sit at the bar. The bartender gave us great service from beginning to end, as did the entire staff.We ordered three of the antipasti. First was the celery and tuna conserva salad with bottarga, potato and lemon. The flavors were clear, crisp, and distinct and went very well together. Next was the brussels sprouts with garlic, capers, lemon and parsley. The sprouts were deep fried and were delicious. Not greasy at all, with a very pleasant, mild flavor that was complimented by the garlic and capers. I loved this one. Finally we had the grilled pecorino with marinated mushrooms. This was also quite good. The cheese was a bit crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. The mushrooms were toothsome and very nicely seasoned. Antipasti are $7 each, but if you order three it's $18, or if you order five you get one of the free. Then we split the spaghetti carbonara. It was beautifully seasoned with a good amount of salt and pepper, cheese and eggs. The sauce held on nicely to the pasta, and the guanciale was delicious.For dessert we had the pana cotta with nuts and persimmons. The pana cotta chocolate, and was full bodied with a wonderfully creamy texture and great chocolate flavor. The persimmons were mild and sweet and the nuts were very salty. These flavors went together surprisingly well. We also had the panino with caramelized milk, pears, shaved chocolate and sea salt. Also very good, with a variety of textures and flavors playing together.I will definitely return to try the fried young chicken! Thank you, SPQR!, 'Who would think that brussel sprouts can be good, let alone amazing!The spaghetti is some of the best, ever! The hostess was very accomodating, and our server was great. I will definitely go back...only downfall is if you are real hungry, you may want to look somewhere else, as the restaurant is not that big, it does not take reservations, and it is always PACKED!', 'Delicious!! Walked on a Saturday night at the perfect time getting at seat right away, though by the door, did not have to wait. The atmosphere is just lovely and simple, not to loud and just the right lighting. Went here with the boyfriend for our dinner and movie date night. The food was amazing! Everything came in a timely manner with just the right amount of time between course. Service was personal, from the moment we walked in. Has the feeling of a great neighborhood restaurant, look forward to going back. Reasonably priced with a variety of choices for all palate tastes. Totally willing for a table next time!', I wavered between 3 and 4 stars because I think this restaurant deserves 4 for the food but a 3 for the hostess. The restaurant is definitely cozy, i.e., packed and small. They did a good job redecorating from the Chez Nous days. The food was hearty. I ordered the rigatoni pasta and it was tasty and like comfort food. The antipasti were good. We ordered the brussel sprouts, pecorino, the crudites, sausage and ribs. The bill was actually really affordableHOWEVER, when my friends and I arrived super early at 6 p.m. so we could get a table at 7ish p.m. we encountered a lame-o hostess. Basically we had a party of 7. The hostess said NO WAY and you would have to come at 530 or 930 to seat a table that large. We were like, fine, how about splitting into tables of 4 and 3? My friend noted as she said that, a table of 4 was available, fyi. She said, again, you have to wait until 930. We had to explain again, that by splitting into tables of 4 and 3, we did not have to sit together, be seated near each other, talk to each other, or even order the same food. She had to consult with someone else, who actually said, yes we can do that. Finally, someone with a brain, or someone who could think outside the box (sheesh that wasn't really outside-the-box thinking, but anyway)! After the initial experience with the hostess, my expectations regarding this restaurant were already deflated. I had such high hopes after reading all of the other yelp reviews and in 7x7. Will I return again? Probably if I find myself starving on Fillmore Street. Will I suggest a bunch of people to go here w/o a reservation on a Saturday night? NO.*********ok i just got this msg from SPQR today 12/20/07******But, still doesn't explain the lack of understanding if we wanted a table for 4 and a table for 3....Props for reading their reviews and responding however. Hi Natalie,Thank you for your dining at our restaurant. I am a manager at SPQR and I just wanted to quickly respond to your recent review as our guests are very important to us. We apologize that your experience was tainted by the wait list situation. As our restaurant is very small and our kitchen is even smaller we are unable to take parties larger than 5 during prime dining hours. Our hostess must follow these rules in order for the dining room to flow smoothly and for the kitchen to be able to feed all of our guests. The hostess usually has a long list and we want to be able to seat everyone and unfortunately it is not always easy. The table for four that you saw open was already accounted for another guest that checked in before your party. I am very sorry that we were not able to seat your party all together at an earlier time and that you had to wait. We do appreciate you waiting and committing to dining with us. Unfortunately our restaurant is not the best for big groups, especially on the weekends. I hope you come back and try us again so we can hopefully provide you with a great dining experience.Thank you,Ehren, Came here on a Sunday night at 7:30 pm and waited 1 hour but it was well worth it. The food was awesome - had the mozzarella balls, octopus, and chicken livers for apps. All three were excellent. Wish we could've tried the sweetbreads but they were out. Spaghetti carbonara and rigatoni something for mains and both dishes were the some of the best pasta we had in the city. We were too stuffed to even think about dessert.The service was fabulous. Our waitress was knowledgeable in every aspect. Spikey blonde hair - if you're reading this, thank you so much for your hospitality. It was very appreciated.For 2 people I'd recommend doing 3 apps ($18 for 3), and either 2 pastas or 1 pasta + 1 entree. That's plenny of good food for both of you. Enjoy., I was super excited to try this place, especially because I LOVE A16 (same owners) and I HATED Chez Nous (restaurant in its place before). First of all, I was really peeved when we were trying to get a table at a no reservations, new hot restaurant. We were a party of 7, so we were prepared for a wait. And I knew the place would be small so I figured there was a chance a party of 7 would not work at all. The hostess told us that they only accomodated large parties at 5:30 or 9:30pm. Ok, it was 6pm, so I told her, no problem we can split up into a table of 4 and 3. She still shook her head and said 9:30 only. And I made sure she understood that we would be ok to sit apart, at different times, and on different bills. She looked stupidly at me and hesitated, not sure what to say to us. At this point I was really annoyed! She then checked with the other hostess and she said to come back at 7:30 and that would be fine. Great, but there was a table for 4 already open just waiting for people to sit down at. What's up with that? So we left and went to the bar across the street and fumed over how lame we thought the hostess was until 7:30 rolled around. I will say, it is a much better experience to be all seated at the same time even if you are at different tables, but I think I was hungry and cranky and wanted to be seated asap. The food was overall good, but didn't wow me like A16. Maybe I'm being a bit tough on it since it's related to A16, but its hard not to. The anti pasta was decent. I wasn't super crazy about the chicory salad as I thought it was a pretty simple basic salad and the anchovies advertised on the menu eluded me from their presence on the plate. The fried sweetbreads kinda tasted like chicken nuggets but were nicely paired by celery. The homemade pork sausage was tasty though. I was so excited about trying their home made pasta! We ordered the one with rabbit and kale, but it was a bit of a dissapointment - just not that flavorful. The mains were very good: cuttlefish and lambs neck. I've never had lambs neck - tasted like super fatty stewed meat. The desserts were pretty lame. We had a chocolate panna cotta that tasted like a better version of jello pudding and a rice pudding that tasted like watery rice with sugar. Blah.Overall good place to get italian food, but definately not good for groups. But I'd much rather endure the wait for A16 then this place., Hmmm. Yah so I didn't enjoy my dining experience here which was very disappointing. The service was fine and the place is cute but the food was so so. Everyone else enjoyed their meals so maybe I need to give it another chance. The lamb shoulder was recommended as the chef's favorite. It was horrible. Fatty and gross. The appetizers were good but didn't look very appetizing when they were placed on the table. The restaurant smelled funny too. Reminded us a little of a bathroom I hate to say. Turned out to be a smelly cheese that was nearby. Yuck. Oh yeah and they don't take reservations so you have to wait outside for about 30-60 minutes depending on how large your party is., Wow. I expected this place to be good, purely based on what these guys have done with A16, but what I didn't expect was to have pasta that perhaps is even better. The Carbonara is probably the best I've had - anywhere, Italy or otherwise. So hats off. It's always great to see good people do so well., Yum, yum, yum and more yum!If you can get in (we got in no problem, but then again, we got there early).Some suggestions on the delicious food: get the antipastis (3 for 18$ is a good start), brussel sprouts is a must and then mix and match among the cold, hot and fried options (we didn't get the sweetbreads this time, but I shall return!).The pastas were super tasty, my fellow diners chowed down Strozzapreti (w/ ragu of braised rabit and black kale) and Cannelloni (of braised lamb, potato, tomato and pecorino) respectively. I had the local calamari (w/ ceci beans, capers, spigareillo and onions) and was floored at how fresh, flavorful and tender it all was. And then for dessert, we shared the Almond milk granita (like delicate almond snow) with espresso crema (rich and decadent) and the Chocolate panna cotta (creamy and luscious) with walnuts and persimmons (wonderful accompaniments - who'd a thought?)But one of the highlights for me was that they also served Blue Bottle Coffee. It was great, I look forward to going back and bringing my hubbie along so we can sample some wine and try the other fabulous offerings on the menu. Service was also pretty darn great. Yeah, they don't take reservations, but not everything in life is planned out or scheduled. Those instances often turn out to be the best ones and the most memorable., 'This place is definitely worth the hype. I was not too impressed with the decor, and our waitress was nice but not very available. The food made up for it though which is why I gave it five stars. We showed up at 5:30 on a Wednesday and had to wait for two hours! Definitely keep that in mind if you are on a first date and would find it awkward to hang out for two hours before your meal. We started with 5 antipasti for $28. We ordered the Marinated beets and fresh ricotta, Grilled pecorino with marinated mushrooms, Brussels sprouts with garlic, capers, lemon and parsley, Cauliflower with Calabrian chiles and Mozzarella bocconcini with spicy tomato sauce. Everything was de-licious! The standouts were the Brussels sprouts and the cauliflower, but I could have done without the Mozzarella. It was the perfect amount to start with for three people. For entrees, two of us had the Whole fried game hen had one had the Beef brisket garofolato. The game hen was unbelievable and did not even need the salsa verde that came with it. They should serve it in a shallow bowl though, it was kind of awkward just sitting on a plate with out anything to anchor it. I did not try the beef but I heard it was delicious but a little bit fatty. Then for dessert, we ordered the Panino and the Chocolate Panna Cotta. The Panino was basically a grilled cheese but with carmel and pear and was pretty good. The Panna Cotta was absolutely perfect and served with chunks of persimmon. Overall, a fabulous evening.', Dropped in for brunch with a couple of friends. We were ready to try something new and shared the griddle cakes. I got deep-fried poached eggs that came with some other stuff. It was all okay.... Service was attentive at first, but we couldn't even get coffee refills.|1
50|spruce-san-francisco|'After Many returns, all I can say is this is one of the great San Francisco dining experiences. The food, atmosphere and service is always of the highest caliber and there is never, ever room for error. As an example of the service and staff, just the other day while dining at Spruce for lunch, my sister started pulling change out to go feed her meter. One of the management staff, Megan (sp?) happened to be walking by the table and offered to feed the meter for my sister, and this was unsolicited. The feeling at this restaurant is that each and every one of their guests really is important to them; and and as a guest, you feel it. The food is always amazing. I would be remiss in not mentioning the wine list, or the drink list. Spruce is an exceptional restaurant offering an exceptional experience. Bon apetit!My original review:One super-hot sexy interior with a sizzling bar and lounge area; chocolate brown mohair, chocolate brown woods mixed with honey colored ostrich skin......Ooh la la. Upon entry is the library on the right with a cozy fireplace. Nice place to hang out and converse. To the left is the cafe where you can purchase food on the fly, or a coffee, espresso or tea - they have an great list of coffee and teas, custom blended. Opening night did not disappoint. The menu is full without being too much; there is something for everyone. So. To start, we ordered the entire appetizer menu, to share, for four. The chef sent each appetizer out as it complimented and supported the next. It was an experience I will not soon forget. The entrees were phenomenal. All four that we had ordered were exceptional. Another facet is the wine list. It is extensive. The sommeliers are genius and we were comfortable talking with them. Nothing stand-off-ish. No snobbery. For those cocktailing, full club service is offered and it comes off seamlessly. So, the rest of the xperience? Desserts? Well. How do you say brilliant, without sounding trite? Exceptional? Amazing? Okay, Il just say OFF THE HOOK!!!!! The pastry chef obviously understands that dessert is the final course and he accords each the highest esteem and regard: his love of the craft and the delight it creates. Bon appetit. This is what dessert is ALL about. Try it. Youl like it. And, you will be very well surprised. Service? Impeccable. My impression: this was the finest, and most approachable gastronomic experience that I have had in many years. I will be back, oh, I will be back.AND I have been. AND. BRAVODining here for lunch is great. The burger is great, especially when you add blue cheese and bacon.....', i am so excited for this place to open up, i haven't been this jazzed to see something happen in the city for awhile. the team and food sound great. the minute i can get a reservation, the happier i will be!, 'Let me just cut to the chase:Spruce is a big time winner.This joint will compete with the big boys for the title of best restaurant in town. Spruce has it all, a beautiful space, a great location, excellent service, and most importantly, impeccable food.We met friends here for drinks in the bar area and then moved into the dining room for dinner. The bar menu offers a bunch of different snack type foods plus a burger or mussels- we had the charcouterie, olives, cheese, and fries, all of which were scrumptious. In particular the charcouterie plate reminded me of my honeymoon in Alsace, France, nowhere in North America have I tasted such perfectly constructed pate and house-cured meats. I give this dish a perfect score and would return to Spruce just for this alone. The wine list is amazing, with numerous great selections by the glass. Our table had a beautiful panoply of wines from around the world, Barolo, Viognier, and White Burg. There is also an attractive set of half-bottles in addition to the very thorough full bottle list. For dinner, we had the Maine lobster ($36) and the slow roasted beef short ribs ($28). Both were exquisite and were fresh new takes on classic ingredients, and the portions were LARGE. The service was impeccable, from the waiter in the bar area, to our lovely server in the dining room, to the sommelier and the manager Meghan who was brilliant and sweet!We cant wait to go back and I would encourage all of you to check it out as well! Spruce is a winner.', 'Really really really good. Really.We didn try anything in the casual bar foods area, but went for the fancy meal. Just about everything, as we might say in our yearly performance reviews at work, exceeded expectations. Let see, where to start...Cocktails were yummy. (So is a Pimm cup the new in drink? Everybody got one these days...) We experienced two new restaurant just opening up glitches. On the one hand, we waited about 30 minutes past our initial reservation time before we got a table (luckily, we found a way to pass the time -- see the above note on cocktails). On the other hand, they accidentally gave us two amuse bouches. So I guess those even out.Appetizers were great. The cod-and-corn chowder was excellent, and they serve it by giving you a bowl full of dry ingredients first, then pouring in the liquid at the table, so that your ingredients don get a chance to go soggy. I love when restaurants do that. The spearmint-and-harvest-greens ravioli was fantastic. I know it doesn sound like much, but it was definitely worth ordering.Entrees were also excellent. My wife got the albacore, which was very good. I got the short ribs, which had a perfect melt-in-your-mouth texture. And it tasted great, too.Desserts were also good. My wife was a huge fan of the semolina cake (served with Strauss cream sorbet and berries). I got the chocolate fondant, which was merely good -- nothing wrong with it, but there I guess only so much you can do with chocolate ganache. I think next time, I try something a little more unique in the dessert category.A very large wine selection full of wines that Ie never seen before. Our wine was good, but I don remember what I ordered. (See the above note on cocktails.)Service was polite and prompt. The dinner was not cheap, but neither was it outrageous for the quality of the food. If you were to compare it with somewhere like Ame, it actually quite reasonable.Oh, yeah, and the bread-and-butter? Great! Just don fill up on it.', 'I happened upon Spruce by chance looking on the net for new places to eat. I read a small summary and then a few blogger posts and realized that place had actually yet to open. So I made my reservations for Spruce third day being open.The space itself is gorgeous, dark wood interior, modern charcoal art, sleek bar, wine racks and of course well dressed servers, who are uniformed in white shirts/black vests with the floor managerssporting full suits. There a small lounge area with a fireplace up front, while across the hall is the cafe that you can stop in for a quick bite or more casual experience. We were seated fairly deep into therestaurant where we have a view of the whole dining room, a small semi private large party table, and part of the bar which was separated by a high wall. Since we were looking to catch a show that night, we were there earlier than our usual dining time, and only a few parties were in the main dining room. Surely enough as the night went on the room filled up completely.We we started off with an amouse bouche of pureed white beans on a crostini topped with a cherry tomato, and of course a wonderful roll of bread and softened butter. They have a separate menu for their charcuterie and cheese, so chose appetizers off that consisting of the coppa and smoked chorizo, accompanied by figs, sweet onion/peppers and toast. These were more like small samplings than a huge charcuterie plate, so you can choose many without getting too full for your main entrees. For our main courses we went for the Mint-Harvest Greens Ravioli (entree size) and Maine Lobster with Yukon Potato Gnocchi. Both were excellent, especially the sauces they came in. I could have had just the bread with the butter sauce the lobster came with and made a meal out of that. For desserts we went for the Chocolate Fondant and the Semolina Cake. The fondant came with bits of chocolate cookie embedded in it and was accompanied by a white chocolate sauce and chocolate ice cream. The Semolina Cake came in little squares with very plump blackberries, mint, and cubes of frozen Strauss cream. I liked the fact that neither dessert was too sweet and were fairly well balanced.Spruce has an extensive wine list but we leaned towards cocktails from the bar menu instead. We had two rounds of the Sidecar and Between the Sheets. With your cocktails, they are shaken at your table so you get a bit of performance with each drink. I think when I return next the wine list will definitely get the thorough look over.The service was fairly impeccable as you expect for an establishment such as this. We felt our waiter might have been a bit nervous and since we were there early, a sense of being watched never left our minds. Since it was their weekend Grand Opening you could feel everyone was on edge to make sure everything was going to turn out right. Hopefully after a month or so, theyl ease into it and get the more comfortable service of a Gray Danko.Speaking of Gary Danko, it definitely in that price range. The menu is more focused but you can expect the entree sizes and the pricing to be comparable. Theye off to a good start and I expect this place to be a hit as long as they can maintain and refine their opening weekend status quo.', 'i admit to having some seriously high expectations for this place. overall, i think spruce delivered on most of them. i knocking off one star for the wee only been open for 6 days glitches.the reservation: i confirmed earlier that day for an 8pm reservation and my friend did the same since we had a party of 6. we get there and they tell us the reservation was made for 8:30pm. oh well i guess that an open table talking to spruce glitch. the annoying part is that we weren seated until about 8:45pm. il totally give them that one on being open for 6 days.the service: they are definitely still trying to figure things out. we had 2 waiters introduce themselves and then both disappeared for about 20 min. the sommelier was very attentive and our wine appeared before we even got water and at the same time we got to finally order. it was a little weird. the timing on things needs work but it not terrible at all. just new.the food: we stared with charcuterie and cheese which was a fairly nice selection. 2 of us ordered starters - the chowder, which was super fresh and tasty and the zucchini 2 ways, the raw was ok but needed some seasoning, the deep fried and stuffed squash blossom was tasty but maybe a bit greasy. the portion on this one was really large and maybe should be a little smaller.the chef sent out an amuse bouche of pea and mint soup. it was overwhelmingly minty but i asked for some creme fraiche to mellow it out and it worked. mains - albacore with corn and chanterelles - super tasty and the corn really made this dishshort ribs with grilled peaches - tasty but they needed to remove more of the fat. i was left with a large piece of it and it was kinda gross. cali peaches this time of year are almost too perfect to cook. perhaps picking one that wasn so ripe would work better.steak with potatoes and kale(i think) - steak was average BUT the potatoes fried in duck fat - omg so gooddessert - we shared 1 because we were so stuffed. chocolate tart with mousse. chocolate is always good.the space: i love the space. we sat in the front room while we waited and it was like we were in someones really beautiful living room. the main building is really beautiful and romantic. the art was totally interesting.i want to go back for drinks and the bar menu. a few folks in the front room were partaking and i was jealous. i hoping that after next time i can give them that one last star.', 'I give Spruce a reluctant three stars, reluctant because three stars is a bit high. It not that the food was bad. It wasn. In fact, it had some interesting twists (evocative of Asian influences, the kind of food -- like Vietamese food -- that goes well with champagne and rieslings). I applaud that inventiveness. There was an interesting ravioli with spearmint, for example, and the combinations were good (albacore with corn __ and chanterelles). But the food was heavy. For example, I bet there was duck fat in the albacore over corn something something with braised chanterelles. (Read: the something something was duck fat.) No hiding the duck fat with the roasted potatos because the menu trumpeted the duck fat element. And by the time we got to the steak with roasted duck fat potatos, well, I was about dead with fat oversaturation.The fat factor is so typical of fine dining experiences these days, but it does not have to be that way. Sure, I read the Kitchen Confidential articles in the New Yorker, and I convinced that not only is duck fat everywhere, but also fat (probably) (okay, more than probably) makes food tastes good. (In Portland recently at Noble Rot, I was treated to the horrifying sight of duck fat being scooped out the night before to make duck confit.) But still. Consider Bar Crudo (oh-so-inventive, amazing food that tastes like the sea) or transcedent Vietnamese food. Not fine dining, you say? What about Chez Panisse Cafe? Tastes good and not over fatted. Same with Gary Danko, though that trends a bit fattier. Chez Papa does some amazing dishes that are practically light. So it was too much for me, even though -- as I said -- I recognize that the chef was pushing for something more creative and succeeding to some measure. I bet there some secret school somewhere, though, that tells them to shovel in duck fat, and I telling you, that a bad school.On to the wine list. Unlike the almost spare menu (a concept I like), the wine list was a book. It a Silicon Valley book, or an LA book, not a San Francisco book. Now, in fairness, apparently some of the listings are two or three bottle holdings, but still. It was huge. And hugely expensive. With what looked like a high markup. Not a domestic sparkling wine on the list, which I resent because the French champagnes were so high-priced as to be an extravagance. I thought this already and am not stealing it from yesterday New York Times, but I drink a lot of champagne, and I don think it should be a special occasion drink. It an affordable everyday pleasure. Sure, I appreciate the wine guy point last night, which is that French champagnes are drier, and domestic sparkling wines can be sweeter. But that a generalization, and there are increasingly great well-priced domestic sparkling wines that should have been on the list. (They farm their vegetables and source locally, yet drink only globally?) Plus I find it ironic that they dismissed domestic sparkling wines as being sweet when (a) I noticed they were pouring domestic Roederer for their French 75 and (b) they serve so many syrupy (yes, syrupy) sweet Rieslings because they go so well with the food. I think they could have added a value bottle or four of domestic sparkling wine to the list for those of us who don want a times three or four markup for an only okay French bottle (with good stuff being astronomically priced).(We did try an interesting Riesling and a good domestic French-style Syrah with the steak so that part was good. It looks like they prepare cocktails expertly.)As for the space, well, it was interesting. Some parts are good, some not so. The dark walls were OK, the over-high ceiling didn add as much as I would have thought (contrast Foreign Cinema), and the library/host stand were good. They overlit the art on the side walls, which made the side wall tables too bright. The stuffed side couches tried too hard to suggest opulent (didn love the upholstry tacks). The regular chairs were faux ostrich, and the color was good, but they had odd handles on top. I bet it makes it easier to move them, but it seemed too calculated. But these are nit comments, easily remediable or overlooked. I will say that the faux paintings (not the charcoal but the classic reproductions) were too much, and I change them. The crystal-like candles were nice: like flower bouquets.As for the crowd, well, the restaurant looks so different than Sacramento street, but given the location, the crowd had that Pac Heights feel. I saw some social register types there. There was some slight hipster element, but mostly it was a conventional crowd. I prefer a funkier vibe.Am I finished? The service was great (though the wine guy condescended a bit). I wouldn go back. I did notice a $12 burger. That and a cocktail or vin rouge? And fromage. Maybe. But you can get that at the Slow Club.', 'They say that Spruce is the sister restaurant to Woodside Village Pub -- if so, then it probably WAS the mailman. It got to be better. The interior is gorgeous. The vibe is very cool. The food is pretty good and the wine list extensive, but the service really needs to step it up. It a little sloppy (no, it not OK for you to spill wine and water on my jacket and pants without making any extra effort to make it up to me), it a little slow and it a little half baked (I know youe having a bad day, Mr. Sommelier, just don take it out on us).', I am giving Spruce 3 stars with the abiltiy to be upgraded in the future once the opening kinks are worked out.The food was excellent but the service was terrible. We had a 7pm reservation for a party of three. We were sat when we arrived, but we sat for 20 minutes until a manager? took our drink order. We then ordered a bottle of wine from the sommelier. Our foodserver showed up 10 minutes later and I only had a bourbon drink which was great. Needed some bread which took another 10 minutes. When we finally ordered we started with the cold cut plate which was very tasty. For apps we had a sweetbread and prawn dish, a watermelon and lettuce salad, and something else I cant recall. All were excellent. It took a while to get another round of drinks and I poured my own wine several times which is not what I should do when the bottle was $150(or any price). Our main dishes were a shortrib, honey glazed duck, and the steak. I had the duck which was cooked to perfection. I tried all of the dishes and definitely all were perfectly cooked. After dinner we ordered 3 ports, a chocolate cake, and a cheese plate. It took at least 20 minutes to get dessert. They couldn't find the port we ordered and our desserts arrived and were finished before we cancelled them. After cancelling the manager came over and said he found it, but only brought one glass? The meal took exactly 3 hours for a party of 3. I would not mind a long meal if everything flowed nicely, but service was poor in execution. I must stress that the staff was nice, just very disorganized. I would wait a few months to make sure their opening kinks are worked out. In summary, food was great and service needs help. I am not writing this to bash on them as I will return, just want them to know what they need to imporve on. As a footnote, I managed restaurants for over 5 years and had been in the industry for 15., i apologize for deleting my amazing previous review, howeverrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrc_rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrSpruce is like that person you meet drunkenly at a bar. The mood is right, you're feeling hot, they're looking hot and you hit it off. It's love at first sight. The person is gorgeous. . . with those eyes that just lure you in and you want more. You have an amazing conversation and everything feels perfect and you think-- i can't believe I finally met my soul mate. And here. . . at this very bar. You hit it off so unbelievably well that you might even make out a little. . . and for you skanky little horny sluts. . . you might even go home together, and have a mind blowing romp.But either way that next day. . . or the next time you see that person. . . you can never recreate the perfectness of that first night. . . and that was my experience with Spruce. What was once a magical evening of perfection became one of terrible bar service, awful, flaky, unprofessional servers .. . . mediocre food, over seasoning, under flavoring and excessive sauces. Spruce--- you're not the one for me. I thought you were, but i was wrong.Maybe if you put some tabs on your amazing wine list hire ONLY career servers . .. ( i am aware that you have at least ONE outstanding, 'make you fall in love with the restaurant' server AKA- Kelly. I know that a lot of scientists are against that whole cloning thing, but if you're going to clone someone, it should be him) hire attentive bartenders that can handle the crowd hire the most efficient front house staff you can (Translation: Meghan should run everything.) get the kitchen staff coordinated into 5-star food that can match that 5-star ambience. maybe then we could try again. . . otherwise, you're just that one-time charmer that will never ever win me back over as the comfy, cozy, reliable neighborhood spot that i once thought you were., My second anticipated dinner in three days (see my review for Canteen) and another five star experience. Loved the modern space, especially the dramatic entrance. Deep woods were complemented with the perfect ambiance set by the track lighting, accent lights on the artwork and plenty of candles. I was sold even before the food arrived. And the food was amazing. As a starter I had a watermelon salad, a reminder of just how incredible fruit tastes on greens. The entree was the highlight. Seared albacore tuna with a corn fondue, one of the best dishes I've eaten all year. We passed on dessert, though the selections and house coffee were all appealing. Perhaps a reason to one day make the trek from the mission and return to this new culinary treasure in laurel heights., This place is hot hot hot. Dressed to a tee like I had an invitation on the Spruce Goose I entered this bastion of the hip and sophisticated. Put on your sexiest outfit to go here ladies because the atmosphere is very sexy. There are several small dining spaces, a main dining area, a bar area, and some private mingling areas. I like the private living room off the side of the entrance, a great place for cocktails. The wine fridge is floor to ceiling. The atmosphere here is old and classy, but delicately modern. Many restaurants in San Francisco emphasize the modern, but I like the classic boys' club feel that this place brings, which is strangely refreshing around here. You don't have to be a banker or the wife of a banker to like the atmosphere. It is tasteful. Very fabulous. There are three leatherbound menus. A bar menu, a dining room menu, and a wine list. The wine list is extensive, like a book. We chose several by the glass selections, which were good but limited. I definitely want to order a bottle next time.The menu was original Californian fare. Steak, fish, burger, soup, We started with a beet potato chip amuse bouche which was good. An interesting choice of palate pleaser. The chef also complimented us with a creme soup with a nice oyster. I liked the taste of the oyster. Very fresh.For dinner we had the heirloom tomato gazpacho, which was a refreshing cold soup, tasted a bit of salsa. The monkfish with mussels as well as the albacore tuna also made an appearance. The albacore was prepared with mushroom and corn. I love corn. The monkfish, which is cheap lobster, was prepared with eggplant and a hint of olives and a ragout of other vegetables. Neither dish was mind blowing, but in this setting who really cares. The place oozes sex appeal. Who cares if your date has no personality when you are staring into piercing eyes and a fabulous smile.For dessert we had the stone fruit bruschetta, which is a cake with peaches and other fruites. In case you don't know what a stone fruit is, it is a pretentious name for fruit with a pit. Keep that in mind next time you are trying to impress someone or sound snobbish. Very nice and sweet, not too filling. It had meyer lemon ice cream which was good. Apple likes ice cream.In summary the atmosphere was a total five and the food maybe a three. The preparations were original and unique, but the taste wasn't orgasmic. Definitely worth another visit if only to soak in the fabulous atmosphere.Update. Second visit.A second date can make or break a potential relationship. Perhaps your date be uncharacteristicly witty that night, spurring a long period of seduction. Or maybe you will encounter your date on an off night, prompting a lackluster impression, leaving you to dust your true soul mate on the side of the road. Oh Spruce, you are somewhere in between, as any reasonable girl would allow.Seating.Trying to get a seat at the bar reminded me of lining up for coach class on Southwest. As you are not assigned seats, you are forced to stalk the other patrons at the bar, breathing down their necks until they are finally sick of you and decide to take leave of the place. As this is a 'finer' restaurant, i might suggest taking down names or a waitlist for the bar area to avoid this tasteless way of self seating. It is never effective and there really isn't any benefit in having free for all seating. If someone can lend some insight into this, I welcome you to weigh in. Do we really want a Mike Tyson style brawl while we await our high soc dining?As for the short corridor where we stand stalking our predecessors, this is a narrow hallway of a space with wait staff shuffling through. Would it not be more appropriate to have a lounge area to congregate as we wait for our three hundred dollar dinners? The last thing I want to do is contend with the plebs while I am hungry.Service.Bar staff is a slightly inexperienced for an expensive restaurant. After requesting two drink refills, I was asked what wine we were drinking. Ok people, you are charging ninety dollars for an appetizer. You should be able to work out a system where I do not need to recite my drink to you. A bartender is an expert. A diner is not.Food.Food was good. A lovely duck breast prepared with foie gras was the highlight of the meal. There's nothing like a rich foie gras to seduce an unrefined palate like mine. We shared a nice salad with citrus that was refreshing and a fish dish that was immemorable. My date refused to finish a bite of the amuse bouche which he conjectured was prepared in the morning or the day before.Overall, a nice experience, however, it is the sexy atmosphere that will keep me coming back, rather than the food or service. Spruce, you are like that gorgeous date with no personality. You will amuse me for a while, but eventually I will tire of you and return to pizza and beer., Gorgeous, huge, high ceiling, darkish, warm, loungey, funky-art, multi-room vibe. Totally unexpectedly grand n hip for Laurel Heights. I love it.Nice bar area for walking in and having a full dinner, esp if you have the bartender on your side to give you advice on who's leaving soon and where to stand for prime vultureness.Food is pretty awesome, but if you're an aggro picky person (hm like me), the uber-succulent lobster gnocchi could use some more gnocchi to go with the massive chunks of melty lobster, the zucchini-two-ways' squash blossoms could use less batter (the raw mandolin slices are perfect), and the beet greens ravioli - as tasty as they are - had a microscopic amount of beet greens. Lemon verbena ice cream was way to airy and warm. And actually, the 5 burgers that went by us during the night looked a little thin and wimpy.Criticism aside, great place. Great for a date, great to catch up with friends, great all around if you're up for spending the cash.Right across from Sociale, btw. Easy parking but if you're lazy they have valet., 'The ravioli with spearmint made me cream...or was it the sommelier?', Bar Scene was definitely the graduate class of the Balboa Cafe. Resturaunt interior was cold and uninviting. The host was warm but could use a wardrobe makeover.... Hope they didn't pay too much for the art on the walls! Wine selection was average but the food was insanely good. I ordered a sea bass and they nailed it! There were multiple flavors including dill, flavored thyme olive oil, cucumbers and whipped yogurt sauce. What a treat! My date had the short ribs with grilled peach--good rub and delicious flavors. Thumbs up for the food indeed!, Bar scene was ultra-yuppy. The bartender took his sweet time in getting to me but, once he did, he provided great service. That being said, the restaurant side of things was great. Our waiter, Kelly, was attentive, prompt, considerate and a great guide to our dining experience. The sommelier was invaluable in choosing some great wines and she took into account my preferences-I would love to try one of the $200 bottles but that will have to wait. Food was delicious-we tried a number of cheeses, a few appetizers(the corn chowder and the zucchini) and a few different mains. Although there a few vegetable options on the menu, this place wouldn't be your first choice to take a vegetarian to.We sat in the back room, which is the spot to be if you are looking to escape the noise and the scene out front. I am looking forward to going back soon., 'Update: I am changing this review to 1 star since Spruce has lost my respect completely. I know for a fact that they contact Yelpers who give them less than stellar reviews and try to influence their reviews. A manager from Spruce contacted me feigning concern--I took the time and effort to write some candid, specific feedback, and never got a response. I keep hearing directly from other Yelpers that that their management contacts Yelpers who give less than stellar reviews to try and game the results. This kind of lack of professional integrity in restaurant reviews leaves me scratching my chin. Are Spruces ratings and comments real? Il let you decide for yourself... (BTW, while I love red meat, I can see how any restaurant in San Francisco that claims to be 5 star could not have a single vegetarian entree!! Needless to say, my vegetarian friend was apalled, and everyone at our table felt bad for him). Note to Tim S. from Spruce: Please don contact me again after this update, buddy.****I was really disappointed with my experience at Spruce, especially since I went there only a couple of weeks after having been to the Ritz Carlton Dining Room. Spruce is a total wannabe compared to the Ritz.Our server was horrible. All style, no substance. He took our dinner order a full 30 minutes after taking our appetizer order. He oozed of fakeness and insincerity while talking a big talk about how wonderful everything was.The food was pretty good, but I was expecting great--which nothing was. They forgot one of our dishes until we were ready for dessert, and the dessert took FOREVER to come out. I understand and appreciate the concept of having a multi-course meal, but the lateness of the food was inexplicable. Definitely not going back. This place does not hold a candle to the established mainstays in fine dining.', 'I went to Spruce last night for my parents anniversary and let me tell you, it was fab. The place looks amazing, dark chocolate brown colors for the floors and the walls and a grand entrance. We were taken to our table where they had put a card that said Happy 30th anniversary from everyone at Spruce on the table - a great touch that we all appreciated. We had Kelly as our waiter and he was wonderful, but the staff in general is pretty great, we loved Charles too. My water glass was never empty, something that is so often missing in restaurants. I had the seared foie gras (comes with the duck as a main, but they said I could do it as a starter - yay!) which was delicious! Then I had the butter poached lobster with gnocchi and braised greens. Okay, this was amazing. The one comment I would make is that the gnocchi weren hot enough. Not a big deal, it was FAB. Then for dessert, the chocolate caramel fondant YUM and the semolina cake with blackberries and frozen strauss family cream squares, okay that could have been served hotter and I would have been happier, but it was still delicious. My parents also had the lobster but my mom started with the corn and salt cod chowder which was fantastic, my dad had the sweetbreads....I didn try them :) My sister had the watermelon and rucola salad to start which was gorgeous and then the albacore tuna. She loved it all. The presentation at this restaurant is wonderful, they really take the time to make everything look great.Look, they have just opened, they are teething as my dad likes to say. There are a couple kinks that need to get worked out, but I have no doubt they will.Oh, and they have an extremely extensive wine list, the only problem you will have is choosing which of the thousands of options to choose!I will definitely be back, even if it just for a burger (they looked so DELISH) and a caesar (which everyone was ordering...they must know something I don!) in the bar.', I usually wait until I've visited a restaurant at least 3 times before I hand out such a high score. Went opening night on August 3rd for my girl, J's birthday and it was truly a fine dining experience. And that's pretty amazing for an opening night. I mean, sure they need to work out some new restaurant kinks, but believe you me, these kinks were minute.Very Impressive.We walked into this extraordinary, warm and beautifully defined space and were greeted warmly by the staff. We had to wait about 30 minutes until we were sat, but the Restaurant Manager and the Hostess checked in with us periodically to let us know how much time it would be. Until then, we enjoyed our Cocktails and were appeased.Once we sat down, we found the Wine List to be extensive and a bit overwhelming, so we summoned for the Sommelier to help us choose a Bottle of Wine and ended up with a nice Viognier. Big Fan of Viogners lately. Light & Refreshing.One odd thing about the experience was that the Sommelier asked if I wanted to go back with him to the Wine Cellar to choose a bottle of Vino. It wasn't in a downstairs dungeon or anything, but in the back of the restaurant in these beautiful glass-doored rooms. It was Huge! In retrospect, I would have gone, it was just unexpected as I've never been asked to do that before. I mean, is this something that I just am not aware of? Ah well...For our Appetizers, we shared a Salad of Heirloom Watermelon & Sardines. I know, it sounds like a strange combination, but I am seeing this in many other restaurants of this calibre/genre. It was not a fave of the Ladies, but I liked it ok. We also had a Crudo of Arctic Char, which we all liked a lot.For Our Mains, I had the the Pan-Roasted Duck Breast topped with Buttery Foie Gras. Loved it... Duck + Duck = How can you go wrong?JZ had the Short Ribs which were fantastic, although I like the one from Range a little bit more. J had the Ribeye, which was good, but she's a 'No Blood' kinda gal, so I can't really give it my true opinion as I like my Meat medium rare...Unfortunately, I cannot remember what Mills had. I think she had a Chicken Dish...For Dessert, we had the Semolina Cake which was a hit with the Girls and no not 'my Girls', I meant My Ladies. I think I am learning that I am of the Light & Refreshing Dessert category.I thought Service was pretty good for Opening Night.I am sure that I will be back to do it again..., There's a new contender in town. I say contender because the great restaurants are always contenders. It's hard to stay at the top of your game day in and day out. You can have a drop-dead gorgeous space (which Spruce does), elegantly appointed with great art on the walls (which they have) a terrific bar with great bartenders (yes, again)...you can have one of the best wine lists in town (yep) and excellent service (indeed) but it will always be the little things folks remember.All I remember from last night was one of the best dining nights of the year. All of the above was there. From the front of the house (the lovely Regina greeting us) to the bartenders, waiters and the sommelier the mood was up and friendly, the service impeccable, helpful and never intrusive. The food...well the food.I started with the Corn and Salt Cod chowder. Beautiful blend of a very sweet corn and the salty cod resulted in a creamy, beautifully balanced dish. I had a glass of Fleury champagne leading into it. Finishing both I moved to the Albacore tuna. I ordered a bottle of Priorat to go with it (with the help of the sommelier). The red was big but not so big as to overwhelm the fish. The earthiness worked to support the saltiness of the preparation of the tuna. Lovely pairing.Finishing our wine we passed on dessert but it wasn't easy. The menu looked great. I took a stroll to the back of the restaurant to see the wine storage. Great glass doors fronted large shelves of a rainbow of labels. Curiously, the wine was stored standing upright. I image there is little tradeoff. The ability to see the wine quickly and the fact that few stay on the shelf for long works is the thinking I imagine.Dinner for two with a bottle of wine, a couple of glasses of wine earllier and cocktails before that came to about $275. That included a full tip. I consider it money well spent and I'll be back as soon as I can get a table. Not an easy task these days.Update: Was there again last night and everything was superb again. Had the Bavette steak with fingerling potatoes in duck fat. Wow! This is currently my favorite restaurant in SF., 'I loved the ambience and vibe but the service felt like you were on a slow boat to China. China aside, It still one of the few places where you feel like youe in Manhattan and I loved that. However, the down side was that by the time I finished my champagne, bread and appetizer (high end prison fixins we had already been there 2 hours and had yet to start our main meal!! Now, there something to be said about savoring your meal and taking your time, but this was ridiculous. (Chop. Chop...Time is money, people!) Nonetheless, I prob will go back once theye fine tuned their service....Oh Garcon...service sl vous plait????', 'Whew!! I felt like I was back in NYC with the stylish decor! Whomever decorated this restaurant, I *bow* down to you! Outstanding style! Oh yes, now the food:) I went on opening night and was lucky to get to taste every appetizer! My favorite is the salad and the duck mousse. Yummmmm...Then dinner came and each of us had a different plate. Each one was seasoned perfectly and not overly salted or drenched in gravy. Finally dessert...the pastry chef at this place is really great. Each dessert was the perfect size and not to sweet. If you like fine tasting food, I recommend this place. The service was not to shabby, but could have been a little quicker, as we were there for close to four hours. Then again, we did try every appetizer, had dinner and even dessert with about five bottles of wine! Watch your pocket books unless youe looking to indulge. Then, this is the place.', OK. There is no doubt that this place is stunning. I mean, where did this place come from, particularly in this sleepy neighborhood? So NY, so beautiful. The service was wonderful with great wine suggestions. No complaints there.I just wish I could be as ecstatic about the food. We had a sea bream crudo. The fish was fresh but that's about it. I wouldn't exactly call it crudo (maybe I'm comparing it too much to the amazing crudo at Bar Crudo) - it was more like just sashimi. It was on a long plate with the fish on one side and a tasteless coleslaw-like salad on the other. And I'm not sure what the chef was doing sending out a burnt, dry entree (you don't burn chanterelles! you slowly, delicately let them simmer in butter). But the lobster entree redeemed the whole meal experience somewhat. Go here for the decor and have a drink. I'd skip the meal (and the price tag)., The decor of this place is a highlight- it's gorgeous inside and I love the small lounge off the front entrance where you can grab a drink while waiting for your table.The door staff is great- efficient, friendly, and all over the place (delivering drinks, dropping off food, etc).The food is good, but not outstanding. Our table started with two caesar salads and the boudin; for main courses we had the pork, 2 of the steak, and lobster. The boudin and the pork were the standouts, the lobster was too salty and the portion did not compare to it's $36 price tag. But, I'm giving this place 3 stars because the service was bad. Our experience started out good, but when it went bad it went bad fast. First course dishes were left piled on the table until the entrees appeared in the dining room and entree plates were left well after we were finished; a bottle of wine ordered when the entrees arrived didn't materialize until after we were finished with dinner- even though we could see it on the sideboard (we opted not to open it because, you know, we were done eating); and then we were left waiting again when we asked for the check. I don't think we are huge service people, but I certainly expected more. The big question mark is that with 3 tables (our party, a table of 2, and one of 8) our server did not seem to utilize her back waiter at all. He just stood around, lit a candle or two, and then stood around some more. Frustrating.I understand the burger here is great, so at some point will make it back and sit at the bar. But we're not in any hurry., 'Il let you in on a little secret. I probably eat better than you. Want to know why? It not because I piss diamonds in my sleep, it not because I some kind of gastrosnob, know-it-all with a razor sharp palette, and it certainly not because I a rockstar and you will kiss my ass because....Don You Know Who I Am Bitches? It pretty simple really. It because I not a pretentious asshole who goes to fine dining establishments armed with my diamond credit card and a sack full of false expectations. Unlike the aforementioned assholes, I actually go to dinner to enjoy myself. I know, fucking brilliant right?Dining, fine or otherwise, is not a passive endeavor. You may think that just because you make a reservation at some fancy/super-hyped place and plunk down some hard earned change that the whole world, or at least the kitchen and house staff, should revolve around you. Well forget it. Sure, the restaurant staff is mostly responsible for your experience, but if you ever want to make the leap from just a good meal to a great one...it going to take more than your credit card and impress me attitude.Yes, there are plenty of businesses out there that genuinely suck, and no amount of effort on your part will ever fix that. However, at many places --and certainly at the best places-- it often your choice as to whether you get a great meal, or just an okay one. Think of it this way...say youe throwing a couple of dinner parties at your house; one night it a group of your closest friends, family, and maybe a couple of hot nekkid supermodels with mouths agape. The next night, it your bitchy in-laws (and their close family friend Hitler)--a group who you have to serve because you love your schnookie wookie poo, but who will mos def get the shank if they open their gdamn mouths one more time about how they wish you were a Doctor/CEO/Ricardo Montalban etc.. So... which group would you rather serve your orgasmic best? Okay, it a pretty bad example, but you get the point.Back to reality for a moment.... Getting the most out of your night out is a pretty simple thing. Show a genuine interest in the people who serve you and you might be surprised at the difference. Sometimes, all it takes is an introduction and a smile. Feel free to ask questions about the menu, talk to them about what you like and don like...and when you find something exciting, let them know what you liked about it. You don have to make a new BFF, but a good attitude and a genuine interest can open a world of great meals to you.And so it was at Spruce...when I first walked in I thought...uh oh...over-capitalized Williams-Sonoma home that happens to serve food. See, I not saying that I immune to false expectations...but I don judge a place solely by those expectations. Over the course of that meal...I discovered that beneath all the pomp and circumstance, beneath the formality, beneath all pressure that investors assert in order to make a place profitable...there are people passionate about food and service. From our servers K and K, to our sommeliers Andrew & Sarah...each had a certain pride about their roles and were more than happy to talk about the food and wine. I even happened to share a nice convo about the place with our bus person N....when was the last time you knew the name of the person sent solely to take away your plates? At the end of our meal, Mark came out of the kitchen to ask about our dinner and we had a chance to thank him for the surprises he sent out in addition to discussing our favorite dishes...his passion for the food itself was quite clear.But it was on my second visit that Spruce earned its fifth star. I enjoyed the house cured charcuterie plate the first time around, so the second time I dropped in, I ordered it all by itself. This time though, a gentleman passed by our table and said Hi, I Peter and I the charcuterie guy. I hope youe enjoying your plate! We talked about what our favorites were, his love for charcuterie, and the fun stuff that he hopes to break out in the coming months. He was even kind enough to take a break from the busy dinner service and gave me and my dining companion a little tour of his workspace. Beautiful air cured sausages hanging at the front of the restaurant, rather than just hidden away in some back room...He even gave us a little gift to take home. That, my friends, is real food passion.In the end, it not about the money, it not about clout, it not even about your encyclopedic knowledge of food....it all about taking a moment to realize that there are real people behind those plates and glasses.', I haven't written a favorable restaurant review in about three weeks. Then I remembered that it's been about three weeks since my husband and I got all dressed up, left the kids with a babysitter and went to Spruce for dinner to celebrate our 13th anniversary. I wish I could eat like this every night.We were greeted at the door like they had been waiting for us. Honestly, it was like being welcomed into a friend's house for dinner. We let them know in our reservation notes on opentable.com that it was our anniversary, so they had a very nice table for us and a little card waiting. As everyone has written, the room is gorgeous. I'm anxious to return to Spruce now that I've had plenty of time to digest the room, so that I can focus more closely on the company I'm with next time. This sexy room turned our anniversary celebration into a menage a trois.The food, ahhhh... the food. We started with soup. I had the heirloom tomato gazpacho. I love tomatoes and knew I'd love it, but it still had so much unexpected goodness. How do you get so many levels of flavor in one bowl? My husband had the corn and salt cod chowder with dates. Delish. For our mains, I had the seabass with tabouleh, tomato and cucumber and some kind of lemon sauce and fresh dill. It was the perfect summer entree. He had the steak with the potatoes fried in duck fat and some kind of yummy dollop of fat on top of it all. (This is why I should have written the review the next day - then I could tell you exactly what that dollop was.) Next we savored a cheese plate with madeira. For dessert we ordered the semolina cake served with frozen cream and berries and you never would have guessed that it was our fourth course by how quickly we devoured it. We couldn't help it - it was so damn good. We also had some specially chosen coffee (brewed to order!) and tea.The service was seamless. Our server was lovely and really made our anniversary a special occasion. She was helpful with wine, food, coffee and tea choices. Snacking on Goldfish crackers off the carpet, during an intense game of Candyland the next day, I realized that the hardest part of dining at Spruce is coming down., I will have to add to this review since I only had a glass of wine and dessert this time. But Sunday night after wartching a movie with a friend, we walked over to get a glass of wine and check out the new place. The decor is beautiful, it's truly a superb place for a nice dinner, and I agree with so many descriptions of feeling like you're in NY. The library section is great for hanging out with friends and relaxing. We sat at the bar and ordered wine and....me getting a sweet tooth, I had to get dessert. As always I went for chocolate, but it wasn't to die for as the bartender told us, it was simply OK. A bit rich but not much taste or distinction. When we got the check, he charged me for the wrong wine, and actually poured the wrong one as well, I noticed the taste but I was in a really relaxed mood and didn't care to make a point of it. I hope the food is better, the descriptions in the menu made my mouth water so I hope they live up to it., 'Oh my.Not much to add here that hasn been said by many other reviewers - Spruce is fabulous.We got home from work late (whats new) and were debating over what to order from our trusty personal chef - delivery.com - when it dawned on both of us that we were overdue to try the new restaurant in our hood, Spruce.We called around 9 to inquire about a table for 2 and were quickly told that they were booked for the evening. However, the man on the phone invited us to come down and sit at the bar where full dinner is served. We were on the scene about 5 minutes later, where we proceeded to stand, unwelcomed I should add, at the maitred stand for at least 5 minutes. There was a man (I assuming the person I talked to on the phone) and a woman who both seemed awfully busy moving menus from one side of the stand to the other and both did a few trips around the restaurant before finally one of them said hello. We were actually about to leave - this is how rude they were.Finally, someone figured out that we were standing in front of them breathing and looking hungry and the rest of the evening proceeded swimmingly.The wine list is seriously about 100 pages long. We were almost overwhelmed, so we each had one of their signature Gin Drinks. Bees Knees for me and Between the Sheets for him.Wow. I haven had a gin cocktail since college and I pretty sure Ie been missing out. These were spectacular.We then moved on to the Charcuterie - opting for the Grand Selection. The chorizo, foie gras and pate were our favorites. The bologna was really bland and the cured pig ears was just too soft and salty for my taste. Overall, the selection was excellent however. (pig ears, really??)For entrees we had the short ribs (slow braised with grilled peaches - absolute perfection) and the lobster. Both were rich and satisfying and really flavorful. I would recommend them both highly.We rounded dinner out with several glasses of wine. If I hadn just finished drinking them, I might be un-tipsy enough to tell you what we had. The Melville Chardonnay was the standout, but all were very good.Despite the rocky start with the rude dis-service, the rest of the evening was wonderful Our waiter, Kelly, was truly fantastic. Helpful, informative and funny - he gets 5 stars from me even though his co-workers prevented a 5 star rating for the restaurant overall. The timing and service is perfect once you sit down.The decor is rich and inviting and surprisingly warm for a huge space with high ceilings. The lush fireplace lit library would be a great place to gather for an intimate birthday gathering or Saturday night triple-date.Highly recommended - just remember to be a bit assertive when you arrive otherwise you may be overlooked.', This place definitely deserved a solid 4! We had a really lovely evening at Spruce last night. From the moment you walk in, you're greeted at the door, you take in the warm atmosphere and the beautiful art, and you're thinking, this is going to be a good night.Last night we celebrated our 2-year wedding anniversary. Our generous and considerate friends had called ahead and purchased a bottle of fabulous champagne on our behalf which really kicked off the evening. We were tempted by most items on the menu so we decided to share. Our server was really great as he offered to have it split up into a 4-course meal, also splitting glasses of wine to go with each item so that we could perfectly match wine to our food (since our choices were a bit all over the map) without getting too toasted, it being a Tuesday night.We started off with a little amuse bouche, a gruyere gougere. We enjoyed the sweetbreads, a salad that was a special starter which consisted of burrata, three types of basil and assorted heirloom tomatoes, the poached lobster and the steak. All were absolutely fantastic, seriously. My husband was sopping up the lobster sauce with his bread. The wines paired perfectly, with a white burgundy to go with the lobster, and a really fantastic cabernet franc to pair with the steak.We were too full to order dessert (and it was nearly 11pm on a Thursday night, as we were leisurely wrapping up our champagne bottle to finish off the night!), but they brought out some little treats that were that perfect ending of sweet.For the prices you're really getting a lot of bang for the buck - entrees range from I think $26-36 but you're getting Fleur de Lys, Gary Danko kind of service and quality, so we saw it as a huge value. Plus, although the wine list is over the top extensive - it's like a Bacar kind of book - they've got lists of wine under $50, which we thought was pretty great.They have a pretty enticing bar area with a bar menu featuring burgers, Caesars, etc., so we're eager to come by just for a casual bite and a glass of wine some night.We'll be back, and I highly recommend it! With the Pac Heights clientelle, this is a perfect spot for your boss, your parents, etc. Definitely not a place you want to go out with a loud group and get crazy - I think we were the youngest people in there and with the tables relatively close together (think Aqua) you want to keep things muted and reserved. Check it out next time you have a reason to celebrate, or just because!, 'We had the nicest evening at Spruce. We thought we could stop in and lounge and have a drink or two...and observe spruce. The bar was a bit crowded to just stop in and have a drink...as my friends waded to and from the bar I chatted up the wise people in the front of the house...we established a quick and welcomoing relationship with Peter. Peter was very busy supporting the floor staff and yet made time to educate us on their chesses, salume, mousses, desserts and what exactly they were selling up front. Exceptional! Peter is an exceptional asset to spruce. He made time between orders and training to tell us what they were doing with their cheese courses, pates, salume, bologna...again exceptional. Peter was the type of sales person you want to be around....we bought hook line and sinker. We bought a few gifts and a few treats for ourselves. Now we are curious about the whole restaurant and the kind people working there (that flew in and out with grace to get their cheese courses and coffee/teas for their tables). We will plan an initmate party for the room off the entry with the fireplace. Call a Miss Nicoletti (sp) to arrange same. Go check out spruce dine, drink and make time chat up Peter. Have patience with the crowds and all will be well. Good work Mark S.!', I LOVED this place! I went on a date with my boyfriend (and after you've been dating a while, you know dates can be fewer and farther between), and had an AMAZING meal. The food was incredible, and the wine list was amazing. Even better, the sommelier (a woman at that, I love it) was really knowledgeable and helped us pick some amazing wines to go with our meal. I am a dedicated red wine drinker, but she assured me that this Gewurztraminer would be perfect. Not only do I hate wine, but I hate sweet wine. Well, let me tell you - I let her convince me, and I am so glad I did! Sooo yummy! She may have turned me, if not into a white wine convert, at least someone who can enjoy it every once in a while. However, I have to say, its REALLY noisy in there. Try to get a table in the corner - there is an alcove with two tables sort of back from the main dining room - you still get to people watch all the action, but you are removed enough to have an intimate dinner. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of the huge sports-theme photographs, but all in all - an amazing meal and a wonderful date!, 'it a gorgous space -- love the vaulted ceilings...but the william sonoma HOME furnishings is a bit uniform or generic feeling.but let talk about drink and food (in that order). the bar tender due was rather aloof and that not the right characteristic in a bartender. so after i had to ask multiple times to see the wine list, i found their wines by the glass to be very minimal and uninspiring.the food is good -- not great -- not gary danko -- but good and solid. i had the red endive salad and the sea bass. the starter was excellent -- a nice portion and great flavor. the pears were brillant. the sea bass left me bored and without any flavor. bad choice. i think the red meats are the way to go here.the staff was excellent in the dining room - super friendly and just pleasant and welcoming.', Horrible. Gone twice, bad experiences both times. They are trying to pack them in so serving full menu at the bar, makes it impossible to stand anywhere but outside while waiting for your table. Shocked when the bill came and the appetizer we let the waiter select for us was $125.00. Pushy and obnoxious neighbors pack the place. Tries to be a neighborhood AQUA, but lacks the class or elegance. Don't wast your time, browse a William Sonoma Home catalog at Johnny Rockets and you'll have the same experience., 'A quandary ?One thing I wondered prior to going was how to dress and while I saw a polo shirt and jeans overall people were well dressed.It is a great space, professional staff, this is one of those extremely high end eateries serving cuisine on an artisan level that is matched by few places in the country. The decor reminded me a lot of Bix.I ordered a margarita with $14 tequila, it was not good which is unfortunate. Several of the reviews here have bad things to say about the bar, we were seated quickly and so never approached it, but if youe gonna charge $14 bucks for a cocktail it should taste good, right ? However, it should be noted that didn stop me from drinking it.The wine list for me was over the top, 100 of wines from all over the world priced on the low end to start around 80 - 90 bucks and going straight up from there.The menu has things like Braised beef bravette with a cream of horseradish remolade and braised new baby vegetables.I sorry but I don know what shit like that means ?But I narrowed it down to red meat with a horseradish sauce, OK, fine, that sounds good, put it up.But when it comes like I said, it artisan so the plate is about the colors and the presentation so the horseradish is a swipe of green on the plate, when for me I have taken a bowl of it on the side. Also, I know it hip to do small tastes of things with nuanced flavors and combinations but I wouldn have minded bigger portions.We also got the charcuterie plate, again tiny tastes of things, one of which was pigs ear ? I mean basically flavorless, I have preferred a piece of bacon.So for me it probably a case of casting pearls before swine, any shortcomings are most likely due to my inability to appreciate food like this and that should be noted. However, if youe one of those rare people who can appreciate this type of cuisine, if youe someone can tell a good Chateau Nuf de Pape from bad, if $6 dollars for a cup of Peaberry coffee sounds OK, if you subscribe to, read, and understand what written in magazines like Gourmet then you will very likely enjoy Spruce.Party of 4 with wine and tip was out the door for $415 bucks.Overall, it was nice, I liked it, glad I went, but I wouldn rush back.', Pros-Quaint street-Cool decor, artwork and menus-Best pork loin, I've ever had -Complimentary cheese puff starter-Complimentary macaroons after dinner -Extensive wine 'book' -Inviting looking library area for drinksCons- What's that ?, I can't hear you over all the people and the 'W' esque music- Bring back our wine bottle, we're thirsty - Halibut was served coldI would not rush back for dinner, for the price I think there are definitely more relaxing and pleasant places to dine. My pork was amazing though. I definitely want to revisit the dewey decimal system while I have drinks in the library!, So I have been hearing about this place since before it opened and it has taken me this long to get a reservation. Plan early, it's not an easy place to get into. It's in the middle of upscale Laurel Heights so it's located in a beautiful neighborhood. The staff is outstanding.Furniture is big and dark. Lots of dark woods. I'm figuring the architect is a male. Not a bit feminine. Very high ceilings with sky lights. Depending on where you sit you are going to get more or less light. They have outdoor seating which is covered but is still on the exterior of the restaurant. It appears to be for loungers wanting to drink and have a bite to eat, not for formal dining. A lot of rich older people there. Very rich looking older people. But everyone was friendly. The tables are large and can accomodate large parties. The bar is very pretty looking. The wine list is very very long but there is a great selection of half bottles, wines by the glass and bottles under $50 in red or white. They have a few different menus. Small bites, appetizers and entrees as well as the dessert menu. First restaurant that I have been to in a while where I really couldn't decide what I wanted to eat because there were soooooo many yummy choices. Short ribs, halibut, sea bass, lobster, pork tenderloin, steak, caviar, etc. You name it, they had it. A very expensive place but well worth it. Dinner for two, about $150-200. I'll be back...when I can get another reservation., The best riesling list I've seen for a long time. It's the size of a book.Haven't had dinner here yet but from the looks of things, I'm in for a treat., So, i was so excited to try this place!! I had a shit day at work and i was craving red wine and red meat. I went to Spruce based on the reviews i read in search of this great burger they were supposed to have. It took me about 15min to get a seat at the bar; the place was packed on a Tuesday night. The wine was incredible, cant remember the name, but it's their Pinot they pour by the glass. My burger was.. good I might have had my expectations set too high, but it wasn't even a great burger. I ordered it med-rare and it came out appropriately done. I just felt that the texture and the flavor was lacking. I will most likely be back to have a sit down dinner b/c the place is beautiful, but no more burgers at the bar here, FYI - they're taking reservations 4-6 weeks in advance for thurs-sun nights. there may be unreserved seating between 5 and 6pm, but it's a crap shoot. i'm excited to go there in a month! :), Good food but waiting for them to work out the staffing kinks.My folks decided to pop by this restaurant on a whim and invited me along. I was sure we would get in (due to their reservation backlog) but one of the hosts (there were three! I mean, jesus- the restaurant isn't that big!) sat us in the front lounge area. She sat us around a long short table on a couch and lounge chairs. This was actually really nice, mellow and quiet compared to the rest of the restaurant... until that host tried to cram a walk-in party of 6 onto the couch to eat dinner with us! I'm not kidding. I was like wha?! It's not like Spruce is hurting for business. It was an incredibly amateur move.When the party of 6 decided that this seating arrangement was wack, they left and we settled in for a cozy meal. The food was tasty and the bar menu is a really nice option if you want to snack or not spend too much cash. Our waiter was really nice and pretty skillful but we must have had 8 different people (servers, runners, bussers) come to our table throughout the night- hovering when there was no plate to clear. They were all super nice, but there were just too many of them! And the restaurant was full so it's not like it was just a quiet night.Spruce is ridiculously overstaffed and that detracts from the overall experience. I'm sure they'll sort this out eventually and the food was tasty so I'll probably go back after waiting a bit. Def not easy on the wallet though so this one will be reserved for special occasions., This is an excellent place to go for a special night dinner in the city. This former auto garage on Sacramento street has been transformed into a warm, inviting beautiful eatery. Seriously, the chairs are plush leather and super comfortable. The food is great and all comes from the restaurants own local farm. Everything they use is organic and treated well. Additionally, they have 3 wine cellars!The service is awesome; so nice, knowledgeable and comfortable not snooty. Good tip: If you don't feel like paying for an expensive meal they also have seating at the bar and at a few tables around the bar. You can get a burger or some other tasty treat from the less expensive bar menu. I love being able to eat at a beautiful fancy restaurant and not have to pay a ton!, I finally got to dine here last week. The space is very open, airy, and nice. I came for our anniversary and must have mentioned it on the phone a month ago because there was a happy anniversary card at our table when we sat down from the Spruce gang which I thought was a nice touch. We started with the red endive, pear, and blue cheese salad which was very good along with the date, salt cod chowder. Then moved onto the lobster and also steak bavette entrees. The lobster was gorgeous looking on the plate, It was very colorful looking as well as flavorful. I'm not too sure about the lettuce in there though, it reminded me of something in a wonton soup from Chinatown. The steak with the duck butter I think, was very good. Our server, Charity, was excellent. She opened our bottle of wine effortlessly, was very helpful in suggesting some courses to try, and was a really friendly person. She added to the greatness of our meal there. For dessert, we shared the white chocolate creme dish which came very well presented and we polished it off. I think for someone who wants to go out for a night, dress up, see and be seen by lots of hip SF elite, this is the place to go. As for just the food, it was alright. There was nothing wrong with it, but it wasn't anything special to the taste buds. Kind of how I felt about Gary Danko. But go try it for yourself., 'Loved pretty much everything about Spruce....the location, the service, the decor, the atmosphere and the food. Mark Sullivan is a culinary genius. Everything was great, especially the short ribs, which are divine. Also love his trademark burger, which is also on the menu at his Village Pub in Woodside.', '2 Stars... why... The service was exceptionally slow- at lunch! It took 45min to get our main course, 10 minutes after we sat down we got water, then another 5 before bread arrived... some of the plates were really good, but others were lacking. The service was really quite lacking, but overall I was terribly disappointed. On top of it all, there is a super snobby attitude from the hostess to the waiters and waitstaff.The decor, on the other hand, is marvelous! The burger and flank steak are great as well as the gazpacho.', Luckily, some friends had made reservations (about 2 months prior!) and when their original plans fell through, I was included for dinner...As many of the reviews say, the space is beautiful, dark, cozy, and warm. I would have bumped this review up by a star, but we had arguably the worst table in the place -- stuck all the way in the back, in a corner -- so we couldn't assess the room and/or service. Speaking of, the service was OK -- not bad, not great -- but the sommelier was totally non-personable and, although he did recommend a great madeira at the end of the meal, we figure he either didn't feel confident for his role there and/or he didn't know what he was doing. Regardless, the food was really great. We started with the charcuterie plate and a fresh zucchini with ricotta salad ... a good combination of delicious meats and pates, accompanied by a vegetable. For entrees, we each ordered something different so we could try a bit of everything ... I had the pork and it was a delicious and perfectly cooked tenderloin on a bean salad along with pork belly. We also ordered the steak with frites on what we think was kale (good, not earth-shattering), and the halibut on chanterelle mushrooms (although cold on arrival, it was cooked really well and was delicious; great sauce). We finished with the European cheese sampler (6 kinds) and a white creme on hazelnut cake with coffee ice cream to share -- along with a few glasses of Madeira. The wine list was really extensive with lots of reasonable bottles ... although, I did see a vintage Champagne for over $1000 which would have been fun! Ha.Overall, great experience minus the bad seating arrangement., 'We came in for a quick drink and sat at the bar. Quite popular right now, we wanted to check out the place before committing to a full meal. This is a gorgeous restaurant in a quiet residential neighborhood. Very unassuming and inconspicuous which is a kind of sexy in a secretive way. Prior to entering the restaurant, you can see on the left side a large storefront window. At the counter, youl see a selection of cheeses being cut up to be served to the hungry patrons. Ok, you haven gone in yet...on the right side is a garden room, this room reminds me of the lounge at Le Colonial. Great place to have a drink while waiting for your table, or just have drinks.Then you go inside...it dark and beautiful with high ceilings. The space is split into two parts, with a long bar on the right side of the room. If you head toward the back, youl see the collection of wines in a temperature-controlled glass closet. They also have a private room in the back, which looks like it could sit about 50? I am not sure, just a quick look.We got lucky and took 4 seats at the bar. The seats were made of ostrich leather. So comfortable and wide - just like I was sitting at a table. I had a glass of champagne. The girls had between them a glass of wine and two cocktails. I had a sip of each cocktail - something with freshly muddled berries, and the other was a type of tart lemon martini. We were a little hungry so we ordered a pound of mussels and two orders of fries to share between the four of us. The mussels were $16 a pound and worth every cent. Looking around us, and at the bar, people were having cheese, the charcuterie and the mussels. They had a sampler platter for their charcuterie, and also one for their cheeses. I think they also may have a tasting menu for dinner. Dan the bartender was very nice to us and has a rich baritone voice. Suzanne is a dear.Ok, here the part that Spruce may need a little brushing up on. Breaking dishes. Ok, dishes and glasses break. But if youe obviously piling on the dishes too high for you to carry back to the kitchen, someone should help the poor man or he should come back for them. We heard the breaking of dishes twice. We observed that there was a broken cup or bowl filled with liquid. While it didn seem to splatter on the patrons sitting right next to the table being cleared, the noise was distracting, and I wouldn want to be the guy in his nice slacks getting potentially souped on.Otherwise, all went well, and I think I will come back for a fancy dinner.', Any place that serves charcuterie, foie gras with huckleberry sauce, short ribs, and pork belly has won my heart. Food is exceptional - charcuterie was amazing with some of the best cured meats around, plus whatever was in that ramekin made my palate melt; halibut and pork belly dishes were very tasty - perfectly crispy pork belly. The veal sweetbreads were well balanced and delicious. Moreover, my husband and I loved that they had Domaine Weinbach on their wine menu - a L'lnedit no less. Sarah, the sommelier, is a delight and quite attentive. Interior is sumptuous - leather, wood, dark cloth lined walls, warm fire, and lighting that makes everyone look good. For me, it's hard not to love this place., my new favorite neighborhood spot to have a glass of vino, the front room with the cozy fireplace is seriously smokin'Pete in the cafe who is the king of fromage and charcuterie - is FAB! He is an expert and very hospitable. 5 Stars., 'I was here yesterday for a special wine luncheon. We were in the private dining room,and the menu was pre-selected, so I can comment on the menu or the decor of the restaurant (as I was whisked to the back).But what I can say is that the food and service were fabulous. We started with a Harvest Salad that included razor thin fennel slices and a lovely light vinaigrette. Second course was an expertly prepared seared albacore on a bed of corn fondue and small braised chanterelles. Mmm. Then came a slow roasted shortrib with a horseradish soubise. Given the tenderness of the meat, I have guessed it was cooked sous vide. The sort of beef for which you need no teeth.Il be back, with my sweetie, if I can ever get a reservation....', 'INITIAL REVIEW FOR LUNCH ONLY-House Hamburger served with Bearnaise sauce and Fries! (AND may I add the B-sauce was a haute surprise- it was freshly made oozing with flavors of fresh eggs, tarragon and buttah)Mussels were fresh as a daisy- plump, fresh and au jus in classic Mariniere to die for!!Corn Soup- light , sweet , velvety smooth- perfect end for summer soup!!!PS- My friend and I were looking for parking and asked a lady getting out of her car where we could park. She told us to head for the neighborhood behind the restaurant- and she was right! We were seated to our table- and there she was- our waitress :-) Pleasant from beginning to end! Thanks for the champagne recommendation too :-)UPDATE: 10/27/07THE DINNER EXPERIENCEThe menu choices were superb- ranging from classic salads to foie gras (priced at $10-20 plates). The main entree plates were as impressive catering to a predominantly meaty palate ($20-30). My impression from this menu was that it incorporated something so simple and tasty and elevated it to another standard that can only be described as a atatouille Experience. It seemed that every dish reminded me of an overwhelmingly pleasant and comforting experience and by the sheer taste alone reminded me of time,place and people. This was my experience at Spruce. Fasten your seat belt because its going to be a happy ride!To start off- I had the charcuterie plate- it arrived with the pleasant and demonstrative explanation of the server- whose job it was to engage me with the different pieces and their accompanying sauce. It ranged from the obscure (beef tongue- peppery and tangy with a tepanade sauce) to the ubiquitous rillette du porc (with whole mustard and petit cournichon). One ofther choice worth mentioning was the chicken terrine and ham which came with a plum sauce reduction. This starter plate was prepared and put together in a well thought out manner and certainly took me back in a town outside Avignon where this charcuterie plate, in its simplest robust presentation (thick slices without sauces) enamored 8 hungry students. It was one of the best ealsI have ever experienced- this asypresentation was no exception. The beet salad- which arrived with fresh , crisp greens and dotted with diced sweet grilled beets. The dressing was light with simple nuances of olive oil and sherry vinegar.For the main course dish- I had the pork loin and pork belly with beans, carrots and chards. The meat was tender and flavorful basting in the roasting au jus reduction sauce that hightened the sweetness of the accompanying veggies. The pork belly was splendidly crispy but had a transient oily taste as expected from such a rich dish-- it transported be back to my grandmother suckling lechon: dark amber crispy skin on the outside with succulent and juicy meat in the inside. It was seasoned by simple condiments but endowed with attention and care- this dish, again was no exception. The other course my friend ordered was the Duck with Foie Gras. I have to say given the richness of both these choices- it was just right for this plate. By cutting out the extra fat, the lean duck lacked the fatty exponent so that the foie gras entirely complimented this entree. I love this attention to detail and the cook simply used the reduction sauce to lightly pan sear it onto the meat. This was probably one of the most enjoyable duck dishes Ie tasted in SF without the often rich and heavy taste of meat and sauce.So the review was originally for 4 stars- the gain of another 1 star is for the effortless compliment. Their exceptional service and friendly staff makes this establishment a 5 star quality in itself. PS- The hosts were attentive and accomodating. Sommelier was pleasant and informative, busers ensured our table was clean and filled our glasses AND the server who stopped by to say hi and remember my last meal~ simply AMAZING! Oh speaking of amazing- the beignets were Cafe du Monde quality-except maybe the next time I order it request powdered sugar ;-)', 'OMG I had the most AMAZING time at Spruce last night. I was wearing my newest Tory Burch tunic and I ran into ALL of my bestest Pac/Laurel/Presidio Heights socialite friends, and there was table-hopping and air-kissing, and we were drinking Romanee-Conti, and it was SO expensive, but it didn matter cause these REALLY cute i-bankers were treating, and we ordered this AMAZING duck that the chef probably caught himself, no, he probably RAISED it himself too, and it probably an organic and sustainable and biodynamic duck, cause that ALL the rage right now, never mind that I don even EAT duck cause it SO fattening, but anyway, on the way out I saw Gavin Newsom and he totally winked at me! OK. So my Spruce experience wasn exactly like that. But that the Spruce experience 7x7 et al. seem to purport. That fine. Buzz is fun. But it also makes for this: Me, to reservationist: Hi, I like a table for a party of four next Wednesday. Any time is fine.Reservationist: I sorry, wee fully committed. But I be happy to add you to our waiting list. Youe number 43.Me (silently): @%@&*#!*&#%$& Are you @%#$^&@ crazy???Well. There must have been 42 declines, because we were ultimately offered an eleventh-hour, but very fashionable, 5:30pm time slot. Lucky us! Going to dinner at 5:30 is strange. It like being backstage or something. There were backpack-wearing busboys waltzing through the front door to their shifts, and I swear the burger-munching guy at the bar ended up being our sommelier. But we got a taste of swank once we opened the wine list. Fabulous! Long and filled with those pricey bottlings only the aforementioned socialites can really afford, but there was a lot of well-priced, interesting stuff too. And the champagne selection! Heaven.I ordered a glass of rose champagne, and wow, was it good. And the stemware was good, and the generous pour was really good. I think it was the best thing I had all night. Ouch.So. How could the restaurant of the moment with a pedigreed chef and pedigreed suppliers and surely pedigreed investors not stand up to a simple glass of bubbly? Hmm. How about by...a) starting out with stale(!), doughy rolls that were basically oversized beige cotton puffs with no flavor to speak of? Who bakes this bread, and why? b) following up with blah, blah, and blah ravioli filled with stewy greens and icky mint that did not even come CLOSE to Quince ethereal pastas to which I had heard this dish favorably compared.c) continuing with a duck breast that was equally blah and, the clincher, overcooked! Am I really eating duck breast that is both overcooked AND underseasoned? And the accompanying quince gastrique and seared foie gras didn help: they weren seasoned either. Underseasoning seems to be a pattern: everything tasted like some variation of nothing. And where were the fabulous vegetables allegedly grown by the restaurant group? All I got were a few scraggly pieces of radicchio. d) concluding with an embarrassingly large trio of palmiers, which so awkwardly outsized the other desserts at the table, and were so conspicuously messy, breaking into buttery shards everywhere... not that I minded, but what a strange thing to have on a fancy dessert menu. At least the flavor was good. OK, I know I just blasted the food. But it wasn a bad time. In fact, it was a great time. Because I was with great people and we were drinking pretty good (not for the price, but pretty good nonetheless) French wines, and the decor wasn terribly off-putting, though the hideous faux-ostrich dining chairs have GOT to go and the incongruously low budget artwork sticks out like a sore thumb, but at least the lighting was good and energy was good and the service was good and we were all made to feel very welcome. So I like to come back. But not for formal table service. I like to come in late and sit at the bar and try the more casual bar menu and investigate the non expense-account side of the wine list, and not scan the room for who I know and who should come say hi to me and who I should go greet... but wait, I can possibly ignore those Junior Leaguers over there or theyl totally snub me at the next fundraiser, and shoot, there my boyfriend boss, Ie got to say hi to him, and oh my god I am turning into one of THOSE people!', Not like my review matters, since Spruce is the latest and IT restaurant to set your foot n mouth into. All the foodie blogs, Bauer worshippers, and SF mags are hyping up this big cash cow that is Spruce. Well, I'm here to add fuel to the fiiii--ya!!! So all you Chris T fans or relatives please take my recommondation and try this place at least once. It's not a regular dinner spot since it's hard to get a reservation right now and it seems to be a destination restaurant for certain occassions. But it's perfect for dates, and unfortunately good for business dinners. Lots n lots of suits seem to be the usual clientele.I wouldn't say this is a casual place, since they insisted on taking my coat to their closet. Then I noticed not one chair was covered by someone's coat. Maybe they wanted to show off their fine camel leather chairs, which was great sitting for my butt. Comfy!I knew service was going to be top notch and we hadn't even ordered a beverage yet! Host took my coat, switched us to a table further from the drafty entrance, escorted us until we were finally seated. She tagged our waitor and he offered us our menus. Along the way he must have tagged another waitor because we were given comped cheesy butter bread. Which was good, but definitely something I've tried before. Was this their amuse bouche? Didn't really amuse me. She scurried off and tagged a busboy, who gave us bigger dinner breads. Crusty nice... wish they were warm.I had the Foie Gras w/ Huckleberry ($18) appetizer. I've had samplings of foie before, but I think this was when I truly tasted it in its entirity. Previous attempts had it rolled with other messes, or on top of vegies n sauce. But Spruce prepares it as a chilled medallion with a plop of huckleberry jam, which was a lil off putting for me but helped cut down that creaminess. This is not an appetizer you should eat by yourself by the way. It became way too rich after eating just 1/3 of the medallion. And it was only perhaps 2 inches in diameter. I must have only had $5 worth... plus, I ran out of toast to spread on. Every single entree sounded fabulous and they're written in a way where you can already visualize the dish. The waitor basically made my decision after he raved about the halibut. I wish I had an online menu to remember all the ingredients. I do recall the fish was poached, which just made it extremely tender and moist. The flakes just fell to large chunks. So great! It sat on a bed of spinach, grilled chantrelles, and fennel. And it was topped off tableside with what looked to be cream, but was in fact halibut broth, pureed fennel, and etc etc. I should have asked them to leave that gravy boat on the table so I could just drink it as if it were my glass of wine. For dessert, it was a simple dish of poundcake-like cake and chilled cream with raspberries. Not exceptional, but light enough where my meal was complete and satisfying as opposed to bloated and jean button unbuckling.I went with a friend who would never choose Spruce as a dinner choice. I'll try to recreate his review as if he were on Yelp. :::not from around here friend::: App was Lamb Sweetbread appetizer. Sweetbread? Chris said it was some thyroid gland so I'll still consider that meat. I just ordered it cuz I like meat and everything else had cheese in it. I don't like cheese. It was good seeing as how I ate it in 4 minutes and didn't bother to share with Chris. Her foie was good... I have these kind of dishes back home too, but it's really chicken liver or gizzards. Not prepared all rich like that pasty stuff. I say innards are innards.Then I ordered the lobster... I just saw lobster on the menu and just ordered it. All this other weird fish thing and pork stomach thing I am just not familiar with. I ate it in 5 min... again I didn't think Chris would have wanted to try some so I just hoovered it. Didn't savor anything... I am a hungry man. I was already staring at my empty dish when Chris had finally picked up her fork. Dessert, I just went for the rice pudding because I like rice where I come from and I know what pudding is. I had 2 bites and wasn't too fond of it already. The rice was a bit undercooked and the medjool figs kinda looked like pork skin. :::/not from around here friend:::I desperately want to come back with someone who would appreciate fine food and wine (he ordered 2 cokes!) and also share a bite from their dishes., 'I sat at the bar and absolutely LOVED everything. I love to eat so all by my lonesome the charcuterie, the heirloom tomato soup, the steak and the cheese to finish. The bartender helped to pair my wines and the Barolo by the glass was absolutely luscious. Everyone that I observed looked as if they were having a fabulous time and enjoying everything.The decor was soothing and sophisticated, with the dining room being visible from the bar so it created an inclusive feeling. The staff from servers ( I sat next to the service well), bartenders and sommeliers seemed knowledgeable and professional.I will definitely return and highly recommend it to everyone.', 'They did a fabulous job with the decor on this restaurant. It very elegant, classy, and soothing with it dark colored walls and dramatic high ceilings. It a dining experience here. The staff paid a lot of attention to our table, and were able to make some great recommendations on cocktails and entrees. The service was great. We tasted a couple of dishes. The seared albacore entree was terrific, as was the seabass. I wasn as crazy about the halibut - a bit bland. The meat and cheese guy was so passionate about the product, it was impressive and endearing. This place is on the pricier side, but definitely worth a trip to check out.', 'I took my best friend here for her bday dinner last night. For the hype Yelp has given Spruce and the price point per entree...we had high expectations. Unfortunately...it was not all that. It seems that Spruce is still working out the rough edges of being new. I will say the food was delicious. We ordered the poached halibut which was good...but a bit bland. My favorite was the ahi tuna...incredibly delicious. My issues were more with the lack of flow with staff. We had too many staff members coming up to us at different times of the night. The WORST by far was the Sommelier who wanted to complain to us about the his 24/7 job and being deprived of enjoying SF sunshine days. He did not help us choose a nice bottle of wine...infact we had to tell him what we wanted. Our waiter was attentive and made a great effort attending to our needs and providing pleasant recommendations. The three of us that had dinner last night are foodies, have frequented many fine dining establishments in San Francisco and feel that Spruce is not up to par. Overall staff seems out of flow, hurried and not very knowledgable at all. Spruce needs to work on changing some of their staff and creating a better flow in general. My suggestion: enjoy lunch at the bar...Spruce is not worth it for dinner.', 'Are you friggin joking?! 4 Stars?! This is the only restaurant in SF that a guy could get down on one knee at... if you were into that sorta thing.', I've been here twice so far, and both experiences have been great!The first time, boyfriend and I stopped in for drinks before heading out to dinner somewhere else. We ended up ordering a bottle of wine and nice selection of cheeses. Service was great and the waiter graciously pointed out some recommended bottles from the $50 and under section. The winelist was so extensive, and even the $50 and under section was hard to choose from. We left looking forward to our reservation booked well in advance for the following month...Our second visit was for dinner. We arrived early and waited in the bar. Boyfriend was impressed with the beer selection... they had North Coast Brewing Co.'s Blue Star, after all. We were seated right at the time of our reservation (8:30PM). Again, service was impeccable and the food was so delicious!One thing I noticed... they're big into table-side preparations. For instance, I ordered the chowder to start (delish, BTW)... a bowl w/ only garnish was put in front of me. Then the waitress poured the hot soup into the bowl from a little teapot. For my entree, I had the shortrib which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Boyfriend had a steak with a delicious sauce... which was poured onto the plate by the waitress from a little carafe. Again, the tableside service! Then throughout the night, we would hear cocktail shakers for martinis prepared... yes... TABLESIDE!!!All in all, a fantastic restaurant and a great addition to a neighborhood in need of some liveliness!, My apartment in New York is full of stuff ordered from Williams-Sonoma Home website, so when I read on JuliB that the VP from WS Home was a partner in a restaurant (julib.com/sanfrancisco/p43_), I got excited. My boyfriend and I actually made reservations to Spruce th same night we bought our plane tickets for our trip out here to SF.I was not dissapointed, the decor is just as lovely as I imagined it would be.Oh, the actual dining experience was fantastic too! A meal that involves both a delicious tomato soup, and a good wine (you'll find one you like on the extensive list) is my idea of heaven., Amazing... simply amazing. Unfortunately the only thing that this place is lacking is a younger trendy sophisticated clientle. Oh wait, that's right, it's SF, we're a bit lacking in that area.Anyhow, the service was incredible, Alvin in particular was such a nice fun guy and took care of us 4 ladies. The only full table of ladies might I add. As for the food, everything we ordered was delicious and devoured. The sweet breads, sliced meats, sea bass, short ribs, duck, pork belly and profiteroles... Good lord last night's meal was spot on, exactly what I needed and was a filler for the lack of a male presence.... This is a very good place to take a date. The decor and lighting is very intimate and romantic. It's a very comfortable place. I didn't think it was too expensive, but I'm willing to spend $ on good food, service and atmosphere. Our bill which included a bottle of bubbly, 2 appetizers to share, 4 entrees, 1 bottle of red, 2 desserts and 1 bottle of dessert wine + tip ended up being ~$100 a piece. Not bad for what you're getting. Sign me up any night of the week!, Right around 6:30pm last night my bf decides that he doesn't want to cook, so lets go out to eat. I say OK. It shouldn't be impossible or anything to get a reservation at a decent restaurant in SF on a Saturday night last minute. No problem, I'll take care of it. I went on Open Table (all the while thinking my bf is crazy) and what do I find-a reservation for Spruce. So I snatch it up and off we go, and boy am I glad we did. When we got there it was crazy busy and there where 2-3 different private parties going on. I was a little concerned about being seated on time (because I hadn't eaten since breakfast and couldn't wait to get my hands on some food) but despite the craziness we were seated right on time (1 star.) The service was a little less attentive then I would have liked in the beginning, but I sensed that our waiter was a little in the weeds, so I gave it time. As the night wore on the service became better as he slowed down and also what he lacked in attentiveness in the beginning of the night he made up for in personality and knowledge, as did the rest of the wait staff. (The sommelier seemed to be a little bit of a pretentious bitch, but we didn't really deal with him so still 1 star.) Now; on to the food.The food was amazing from start to finish. We started by splitting the beet salad; then I had the sweetbreads, and the bf had the pumpkin soup. For entrees he had the short ribs and I had the steak with the potatoes cooked in duck confit (I can't resist something cooked in duck fat,;it is just too good. It's like things cooked in bacon grease, but oh so much better.) For desert I had the warm semolina cake and he had the beignets. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted simply divine; well seasoned, clean flavors, good presentation, (especially with the table side prep as the bf is a sucker for that)...neither of us had any complaints or could find any faults with the food. (3 stars.) And so our night at Spruce came to a close. We closed the check, finished our tea and coffee (which was also delicious) and headed out to our waiting taxi. On the way I noticed we weren't the only ones who had a great time, as one of the private parties was winding down, and the only people left was a group of drunk girls dancing and singing to Beyonce, and a guy passed out on the couch with one arm and leg over the back of said couch with an empty champagne bottle in the other hand. ( Needless to say, I know where to go the next time I need to throw a private party at a restaurant for someone.)|1
51|state-bird-provisions-san-francisco|"'Came here for their soft opening tonight and things were looking good! The concept here is dim sum style. Theyl bring plates of small plates on a tray or cart and you can pick whichever one you want. Theyl place the dish on your table and will put a hash mark on your bill according to the price. Their signature dish is the state bird with provisions as this dish is deep fried quail with lemon stewed onions. The pickled wild mushroom was one of my favorite. This dish is full of flavors and texture (hazelnut is the crunchy when you eat it with the mushrooms). The spiced shrimp is also full of flavors - definitely a must!Their tea selection is very good also. I tried their dragon ball ice tea and their white chrysanthemum tea. Both were very light on flavor - which is my preference when it comes to tea. Their dessert selection is very nice. The combination of ingredients and flavors are very unique and it works. My favorite was the chestnut buckwheat profiterole and the bittersweet chocolate croquettes. The peanut muscovado milk was better than expected, probably because Ie never had peanut milk as dessert before! The portions are small so you can definitely order 4-5 for 2 people. The price is also decent as they range from $5-$8 for the items we ordered tonight. You can definitely order all the items on the menu while you pop open a bottle of wine with a group of friends for the night. The staff is so friendly there that you will end up being there for hours! The open kitchen is located as you enter the door so you can see everything being made fresh right then and there. Come give this place a try before everyone else finds out about it!!!', 'Felt so lucky to be invited by friends of friends to the soft opening this weekend and have literally been licking my lips ever since. Great concept: dim-sum style service makes dining not just more fun but also WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). For example fabulous lamb orzo bowl was my personal favorite but so rich and savory that one bowl sufficed for all three at our table. Their Rye bread and red beet iennoisewith horseradish ale creation was quite possibly the single best bite-of-beet I ever set tongue to -- and hey, I a foodie from beet-growing Ft. Collins in Colorado, so I know my beets baby. Likewise the signature fried quail (our CA state bird) with lemon-steamed onions was unforgettable. Crudites and wild-mushroom creations showcased the freshest local produce possible. Opened with a surprising and satisfyingly glass of dry Picpoul from France; finished with perfectly-brewed Blue Bottle coffee served in a French press. Our unanimously-declared favorite dessert (we couldn help but sampled several) was the aptly-named Drunken caramel cherry Mistake -- which the chef discovered by happy accident. Huge beautiful butcher block prep table as you enter sets the atmosphere for some serious cheffing. Tables spaced widely for easy conversation (no bench-style seating with couples crammed together like quails). Hurry up and grab a table before the line starts snaking around the corner!', When you walk in to SBP (as I'm sure it will get nicknamed) you see a pristine kitchen with a wonderful open kitchen to greet you. We were sat immediately and shown our wine menu, carefully tucked under the table. American/Californian Dim Sum is the concept and wow - it really blew me away. A tray of morsels, or a cart comes by at just the right time offering you little plates of gems. We tried everything that came around. Fresh greens with tofu (that I thought was fresh cheese, it was so tasty), Bone marrow and housemade bread stick, wild mushroom farro risotto, the State Bird (buttermilk roasted quail) with provisions of lemon onion confit, these amazing shrimp with a whey pomogranite jus, duck pate with corn financier and so many other things. I can't really write about it because my mouth keeps watering from lasts nights masterpiece! The dessert......well if you have never had Peanut milk, get here fast. I have a feeling it will be one of the most popular things they offer. I can't forget to mention the Rye bread Beet 'cake', it was stellar. The wine list was carefully chosen and beautifully presented. I chose a glass of Cava and a glass of Picpul. My tea was Pu-ehr and I have to say I was very impressed with the selection of tea. No one serves Pu-ehr like this. The prices are exceptionally reasonable and the service is top notch. Each chef in the kitchen have worked at the top respected restaurants you all read about. I can't wait to go back to SBP for more yummy goodness., 'I was looking forward to trying this restaurant based on some of the recent press I had read. Walking into State Bird, it felt so warm and cozy. We were greeted by a friendly staff that made us feel like we have been friends for a while. We tried almost everything on the menu and were excited by the idea of not knowing what was coming next. All of the food that we ate was awesome and the prices were very reasonable. Our favorites were the Quail, the tofu salad with grapefruit, and the Chocolate Cherry Mistake. We are definitely going back real soon.', Amazing. You'll be addicted. The quality of a 5 star restaurant for good prices.I wasn't kidding about the last point. Stuart and Nicole used to be the chefs for Rubicon (in downtown San Francisco). Rubicon was owned by Drew Nieporent, who owns Nobu in New York.Tip: the desserts are a must try.The only caveat is I'm not sure the dim-summing thing is going to work out. I wish I could just order my food tapas style., The food was amazing,,,so many different items yet they all married well. The concept is fun, dim sum style plates arricv at the table and you decide if you want to indulge or wait for the next wave of food to come around. I think they are still working out a few kinks with service but everyone was very nice and knowledgable. I love the quail, i remember the quail from Rubicon. We had some fun dishes, the calamari was so tasty and the homemade bread with bone marrow sauce was yummy. I can't wait to go back to see what else they come up with. Good luck guys,,,so happy you are back on the scene., 'I give them points or stars for attempting the whole dim sum restaurant theme. It different and it may actually work if those carts they cart around were actually filled with food. Dim Sum calls for choice and they need a huge selection of small bites to make the masses happy, or maybe just the Chinese folks. This one cart I saw pass by had two desserts on it, pathetic. The same cart with the same 2 desserts passed by maybe 3 more times. The ribs which came out a bit later as we were wrapping up our meal was delicious! Now if only that stuff came out in the beginning. Very attentive staff who will give you a description of each dish as they make a stop by your table. Sitting in the back, may cause you to get the rejects dishes, unless they have some system implemented already. The space is small, and we were lucky we got a table for 2. Do yourself a favor and make a reservation. It definitely worth a try! :)', 'Support this establishment. Expect to be surprised by tasty food and service. Love it.', I had New Year's Eve dinner here with some friends...a group of 5 of us. This is a new venture from the chefs from Rubicon. After talking to our server, it sounds like a lot of other staff followed them also. When you walk in, don't be confused by the open kitchen that dominates the front of the restaurant...walk a little further in, & someone will help you. So, you get a menu for drinks, then they leave a ticket at your table. The meal works dim sum style, meaning they will bring trays/carts of the food around, and you pick out what you want as they come around, & they mark the ticket with a hash mark. Oh, they do tell you what the dish is, unlike dim sum, where you generally have to ask if you don't know.We were the gluttons who ordered two of every dish that came out (17 savory dishes & 4 sweet) so that everyone at the table could try everything! We thought there were only going to be 10-11 savory dishes, but they just kept on coming...Here's their menu from online. We pretty much had all of the savories & then some that weren't on the list (pork ribs, caviar & chips, chocolate cherry mistake). We didn't have all of the desserts on the list, so I deleted those. crudite with goat cheese & toasted sesametofu with lime, ginger & fennelpickled wild mushrooms with root purees & hazelnutschicken 'salad' with buddha's hand & celery root curdsourdough kraut ricotta & pecorino pancakes'pain au poivre' with oxtail mushroom gravycarnitas stuffed squidrye bread & red beet 'viennoise' with horseradish-ale creamsmokey-grilled chicories with urfa-yogurtfried quail with lemon stewed onions (yes, they serve their namesake here; makes sense, doesn't it?)fragrant spiced shrimp with yogurt whey & pommegranateroasted carrots & braised jammy greenscrispy chocolate croquettes with rosemary-meyer lemon sabayonpeanut muscovado milkclove spiked fig cookiesEverything was spot on...I had lunch with one of my friends who was at that dinner today, & we were talking about how the every dish was solid with innovative flavor combinations.They offer wine & beer, & tea. Our group actually didn't have any alcohol & did our drinking later in the evening.Dd9cor is simple, minimalist...the wall we were sitting against was a pegboard.Service was very good...staff was pleasant, professional, yet friendly.There's a single room unisex restroom at the back. Located on the west side of Fillmore, between Geary & OFarrell. The storefront is narrow, & there's no signage (at least not on the night I went), so I walked right past it at first., 'Simply amazing. Great friendly service, spectacular food and fun atmosphere. Went with a party of six so we got to try almost all of the dishes that came out. Loved everything but especially the Quail, Oxtails in bread, the shrimp were perfectly done and so flavorful, rib were amazing, and stuffed calamari. Go there and eat. Now.', 'Think Dim Sum-style California fusion dishes.Each dish come out in multiples of about four on a tray to be selected by various tables. Dessert comes out on a quaint cart which really needs to be a little narrower and allow rotation in all four wheels: in other words, not designed for functionality.The oxtail, Bone Bread (pretzel-roll) with marrow sauce, and the beet salad are my favorite, and most of the rest of the things we tried (and I think we tried everything except the sardines on toast - we were full, not uninterested) was solidly good and interesting. A few dishes were pedestrian in design, although executed well, and only one seemed to be showing off its outrd9 ingredients.Deserts were similarly inventive and rather good, especially the fig arugula.We were there on the second night of operation, and we hope it does well. The number of cooks in the open kitchen as well as the number of servers seem prohibitive for long-term success; we assume they have run the numbers and know what they are doing.', 'This is one of those restaurants you need to go to now before it gets yelped to death. The clock is ticking!', Everything was delicious! The flavor pairings were all great and my 5-person group pretty much tried everything that wasn't solely a vegetable dish. (We weren't in a healthy mood.) The unique dim-sum serving style made the eating process very leisurely, but if you come hungry you'll probably not appreciate it as much until you've gotten a few dishes in you. However, that said, use the time in between dishes to really savor the flavors and textures! Savory must-try's: - pickled wild mushrooms with root purees & hazelnuts- anything with duck- 'pain au poivre' with oxtail mushroom gravy- bone marrow bread- the state bird provision (fried quail with lemon stewed onions)Sweet must-try's: - chocolate croquettes with rosemary-meyer lemon sabayon- milk chocolate sesame crunch, clementine-cocoa jam, coffee cream (it was like a refined Krackle)For all those tea drinkers out there: try the white chrysanthemum tea! It's really light and went well with everything. The price of the dishes were a bit on the more expensive side, though, and after all was said and done, our bill came out to be about $170, including a pot of tea and 2 big bottles of beer, excluding tip. For the price each of us paid, I personally would have liked to walk away feeling very stuffed, rather than feeling contently filled, but that's just me wanting to feel like I got a great deal. Last thing to mention is parking, which is hit-or-miss on the surrounding streets. I would recommend driving around the block once or twice just to see if you get lucky, otherwise you can always use the Fillmore parking lot which is just one block away. We paid $5 for 2 hours there, which isn't bad at all., In short, the food here is executed at a very high technical level, with friendly staff, and flavors & techniques you have likely not seen before. As far as food- be sure to grab 1-2 plates of the oxtail & pepper bread-- the braised meat lining the fried bread is an experience. Ask how the bread is prepared.Oh. Oh. And the pork ribs are excellent. Braised then grilled goodness.The staff touted the fried quail as the hallmark dish, but the idea felt kitschy, the appearance clunky, and flavor under-whelming.Chicories- unfortunately these were inedible...beyond sour & burned.As far as service & timing, you need to bare in mind that SBP has opened very recently AND re-invented a style of dining, their timing will be ironed out in coming months. That being said, it would have been nice to have received more attention from the wait staff in between dishes. First-month diners are worth listening to: they've likely anticipated your opening for weeks, if not, months; and likely know more about your concept than you think.As far as additions, a full bar would be nice, of course license permitting. For what they do carry, I didn't really get the wine program. I'm always curious to hear the story behind the wine list & why specific wines were carried. Didn't get that.SBP is for the SF diner seeking a new experience, but with seasoned staff, and intricate flavors. You'll also need to be patient, show up hungry & not mind the Reagan-era dining room interior., Came with 5 other girlfriends for dinner last night. Great concept (food served dim sum style), but that also means that the food is lukewarm once it arrives. They need those real steel dim sum carts that hold in the heat. Portions are quite small too. We had to wait awhile for food to come by and it was also intermittent. We stopped midway through the meal b/c everyone was kinda disappointed with the food. The food wasn't bad at all and was well prepared and unique w/fresh ingredients. None of the dishes stood out either. We didn't get to the dessert, but they looked tasty. We ended up going to Sophie's crepes to fill our tummys. Friendly service. There's no sign outside the door, so it made it difficult to find!, 'YAY FOR MENAGE A TROIS!Do you enjoy inventive New American cuisine?Do you enjoy Tapas style dining?Do you enjoy yum yum Dim Sum?If you answered, YES to all of the above, then you will love State Bird Provisions.SBP is discreetly located in the FillMo Having just opened on NYE, it still without any signage. However, you can miss it being next door to the glowing neon signs of Won Mi, a Korean restaurant that I personally banned myself from after nearly taking down a wall of banchans at 2:30 AM. Um yah, we won even get started on that one. :XSBP menu consists of inventive and adventurous American Tapas flawlessly executed with fresh, seasonal ingredients seamlessly paired together creating culinary mini-masterpieces with well balanced flavors and textures. There is no set menu. Each night, about 14-16 dishes come around a la dim sum carts/trays. See something you like? Point and get it. In my case, this is why I LOVE dim sum aka The EEood Diet, I get to eat EVERYTHING I see.F O O D*Prices: $2-12/dish; most were $6-$8*3-4 dishes/person is sufficientAn average of 4 STARS, below are the dishes we sampled last night listed from my most favorite to least favorite. *BRAISED OXTAIL in 7-Pepper Flatbreadyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG43_ The STAR of the night, the warm, crisp, and fluffy flatbread was generously filled with savory tender shreds of oxtail. The light smearing of yogurt sauce gave a delightful layer of creamy tanginess. *FRIED QUAIL w/ Lemon Stewed Onions yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG43_ Deliciously crunchy on the outside and succulently moist in the center, the fried quail was lip smacking good. The citrus from the onions added a ray of sunshine while the parmigiano-reggiano gave a savory saltiness.*TROFIE PASTA w/ Dungeness Crab & Pancettayelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG43_ A perfect rendition of a pasta surf and swine, the al-dente twisted pasta married the sweet crab meat with a scrumptious crisp, fatty richness from the pancetta bits. *PORK RIBS in a Pork Brothyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG43_ The carniwhore in me rejoiced with these ribs. The subtle smoky ribs were crisp around the edges and tender on the inside. The broth was like an au jus imparting a layer of briny saltiness.*BEEF TONGUE PASTRAMI CROSTINI w/ Bone Marrow Sauceyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG43_ The holy grail of all crostinis, the beef tongue pastrami was delectably smooth and salty. The bits of bone marrow added a burst of beefy richness while the acidity of the red onion marmalade helped cut through the richness.*RYE BREADED BEETS w/ Horseradish Kaleyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG43_ I loath beets but this dish made me a beet convert. Nicely coated with rye bread crumbs, the beets were fried to a robust golden brown and then lightly smeared with the horseradish kale sauce. Crisp, tender, and sweet, the beets were wonderfully delicious with a light nose tingle from the horseradish.*BRUSSEL SPROUTS w/ Squid & Mandarin Orangesyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG43_ Crunchy brussels sprouts with tender squid tossed with sweet vibrant oranges made me miss the rare summer days in SF.*FARRO w/ Wild Mushrooms & Parmesanyelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG43_ Reminiscent of risotto, the farro grain was tender with a bite. The wild mushrooms and parmesan added an mouth-watering earthiness and a salty creaminess.*DUCK NECK DUMPLINGS yelp.com/biz_photos/QZQG43_ My least fav dish of the night, the pan-fried skin was too thick and very doughy which hindered the taste of the duck neck. The broth was also very salty.S E R V I C EConsidering theye only been open 10 days, the staff operates just as flawlessly as the food. Theye warm, genuinely friendly, and knowledgeable.We got a chance to chat with co-owner, Stuart Brioza (Rubicon) who was a cool cat. The immense passion he has is emanated in the careful and artful preparation of the food and the attentive service of his staff. A M B I A N C E / D E C O RCasual and inviting, SBP open kitchen is the highlight of this 40+-seating restaurant. As youe waiting to be seated, your eyes and your nose will be tantalizingly teased on what to come. Dimly lit and not overly noisy, it a great place to take a foodie on a date.P A R K I N GDifficult street parking on weekends. There a garage 1 block away across from Yoshi; $3 for the 1st hour, $1 for each add hour. SBP is a living testament that a Menage A Trois DOES work! Honey, don knock it till youe tried it...', (See pics)Review #1095.Inventive items without a menu boundary. State Bird, as the owners used to hike along the peninsula and saw the quails walking around, was the name.A tribute to California and bay area especially with lighter taste that pleases the local healthier crowds, a focus on using ingredients that we are all familiar with but with an interesting twist.Interesting concept-- tapas serving in dim sum tray style as they walk around with freshly made food on scene. The space has a fusion of post 1906 earthquake brick exposed walls on 1 side, sound proof look-alike wall on the other. A very high ceiling and deep space for an eatery.The utmost important dish with the battered fried quail which was very delicious, juicy and delightful. All other dishes we tried, such as duck rillettes, steak bites with a fried egg and vegetables, full on fresh and lightly grilled vegetables with goat cheese, properly cooked pasta with crab meat and peas, duck confit on baked slightly sweetened dough, dumplings, etc etc. All were good with lots of tones in them.For the desserts, the very fine powdered peanuts with milk pouring over it was my favorite as it was very light in liquid but silky in taste. The chopped nuts and raisins in Ganache chocolate sauce, an unplanned put-together dessert in the owner's kitchen in the past, has become a hit and was lovely delicious.Also a simple but good list of wines (for food and dessert), tea and BB coffee are a good balance for the varied plates.On a strip that is filled with mostly Asian eateries, a couple bars and a few music venues, here flies the State Bird Provisions. Owner Stuart enthusiastically described his childhood hiking and seeing quails along the way was a nice touch to this new place. This will be a place where you will find different dishes at every visit., 'Maybe one of the best openings in 2011. Of course they waited until NYE. We got one of the larger tables in the back on opening night and they didn disappoint. While most people were out doing fancy cut throat NYE special menus, we opted for the reputation of two chefs coming back into the game. Turns out the ex Rubicon gang came back with many of their past co workers so the night started off with a staff that mostly knew each other in some way or another. The long corridor with the reception at the front of the kitchen line was not something I expected. I knew where the place was but still did a double take. The combination of industrial space, cafe, and dim sum style service makes for an interesting mix. Things come out on trays in carts, etc, etc. Being the gluttons we are, we had two (yes 2) of everything that was offered:cruditd9 with goat cheese & toasted sesametofu with lime, ginger & fennelpickled wild mushrooms with root purees & hazelnutschicken aladwith buddha hand & celery root curdsourdough kraut ricotta & pecorino pancakesain au poivrewith oxtail mushroom gravycarnitas stuffed squidrye bread & red beet iennoisewith horseradish-ale creamsmokey-grilled chicories with urfa-yogurtfried quail with lemon stewed onionsfragrant spiced shrimp with yogurt whey & pomegranateroasted carrots & braised jammy greensmeyer lemon chocolate croquettes with blue bottle coffee sabayonmilk chocolate sesame crunch, clementine-cocoa jamdrunken cherry caramel chocolate mistakechestnut buckwheat profiterolepeanut muscovado milkwarm fig cinnamon swirlsHow that for a spread? I think we put some fear in the line and front of house as we just tore stuff down non stop. The bonus? everything was delicious and intriguing. The flavor and ingredient combinations are thought provoking while tasty. I think the Fillmore area just got a huge boost and I know where my de facto before shows around the area is now. StatebirdSF certainly ended the year with a bang!', I could not wait to try this place ever since it starting receiving press in the Chronicle. It did not disappoint. I loved the idea of the concept, and I loved it in practice. I don't want to order off a menu ever again. Unlike a dim sum cart, they only put a few plates on a tray, so nothing gets cold. The servers do a great job describing the dish and answering questions. We sat in the back and were initially concerned that everything would be snatched up by the people in front. That worry was quickly alleviated as the staff expertly gets things to every table. The benefit to this style of dining is you might try things that would sound boring on a menu. For example, the first thing we had was a grilled chicory dish. I would not have ordered it off of a menu, but it was awesome. Every dish except the rye bread & red beet dish was really good (I did not personally like the sauce with the beets). My favorite dish was duck dumplings with a ridiculous broth poured over them. The broth was SO GOOD. Nothing that comes with a broth/jus should be missed. The pepper bread with oxtail was awesome. We just cut it in half and picked it up and ate it like an openface sandwich. Cutting it up would leave too much gravy on the plate. The quail was awesome on its own, but the lemon stewed onions take it to the next level. In the end, we only had room for one dessert, the chocolate sesame crunch. It was really good, but really sweet -- so one dessert was fine. I cannot wait to go back., 'For such an interesting food place a proper review should start with the food: wow. Three dishes were amongst the best this hedonist has ever tried: fabulous crusted lemony quail, brilliantly vibrant (I think tuna) tartar, and a non-earthy, redolently citrus-tasting mushroom dish, an unexpected elegant winner. The sturgeon caviar with potato chips, if not totally new (at least if youe been to Swanson Winery Napa Valley Salon) was at least completely DE-lish!, underscoring I think this restaurant sense of humor and self-confidence. Hey, I even loved the seared calf tongue served in room temp blood red (beet, as I recall) sauce. Sense of humor, for certain, and roundly beautiful.Dwelling on that a tad more, I liked the food presentation. Tiny plates are offered on a tray, reminiscent of a dim sum style. So cool to be able to look over everything. Kind of a fun ice-breaker for dates too, actually. I came away feeling the chef really knew how to incorporate a sense of art--textures and colors as well as flavor-- into the meal.A plus or a minus, I can tell, but an important detail: from the outside you would never know this is a restaurant. In fact, I walked by twice even though I knew the address. I scratched my head, and took a shot, still thinking this can be it... The entrance looks like it a catering operation from the outside. Diners essentially walk past the kitchen to a small secluded dining room, a spartan SF-chic-space composted of unassuming peg board, cement and stone tones. The tables are unadorned. The food and friendly nature of the place make the experience as a result. As a really huge bonus for foodies: the wines by the glass are well-considered by the owners, inexpensive ($7-11) and lovely. We enjoyed several as the night progressed, using them as wonderful compliments to a round-robin of sophisticated flavors.', We wanted to try this place first weekend they opened. When we got there, we thought it was closed because we didn't see any patrons from the sidewalk looking in. All the workers, including chefs are at the front where the kitchen is(very Chinese). The diners are all in the back, away from street view. The food are served up dim sum style where servers bring the dishes around and you point to what you want. The server explained what's in the dish and then marked a line on a piece of paper that keeps count of how many $2 to $12 dishes you have selected. When you are done eating, the host will take the sheet and come back with your total, plus tax. All along, you should be able to see how many dishes and your total(if u can do quick math while stuffing your face). They have some really delicious items there. As much as we ate, there were still so many dishes yet to try. Favorite was their signature dish, the quail. Their meat items are quite good. This is not a dimsum place nor a Spanish tapas place. The dishes are quite eclectic and creative. The workers are young hip and friendly. Did I mention the dishes they served up were tasty?! Dining here takes time as you have to wait for the food to come around, but it really is great to sip on wine and chat as food settles before the next dish arrive. You get to see the food item before you buy. The clientele is also quite eclectic. We welcome State Bird Provisions to our block., 'There were maybe two dishes that were just good. Considering we had seventeen tick marks on our tab at the end of the night, that an awfully good record. Outstanding State Bird (of course) and really yummy lamb belly. Lovely service and pretty presentation. One of the ladies recognized me from the Rubicon days! Even waiting by the kitchen for our table was super fun. Pretty loud and crowded, I hope this place will be around a long time.', What a great restaurant! The former Chef from Michelin starred Rubicon has opened his own place. A small plates format at a great price point. And for that price you get really, really wonderful food and service. The format when I dined was akin to that of a Chinese dim sum restaurant. Many smaller plates that didn't require warming were wheeled around the restaurant for patrons to pick and choose. A small group of larger but still modestly priced dishes that require the immediate attention of the patron are ordered ala carte and come directly to you from the kitchen. It worked surprisingly well, although I think they may have trouble getting people to leave. I was tempted to stay to see what would come out on the cart next. I started with mushrooms that came with parsnip, vanilla and hazelnut. A lovely way to start as the earthiness of the mushrooms was contrasted by the parsnip, vanilla and hazelnut. Next, char-grilled chicories that came with yogurt, and dates. A great plate of food as the grilled chicories had taste and texture that paired perfectly with the contrasting yogurt and dates. A larger plate of glazed pork ribs with spigarello and togarashi was sublime. The braised ribs had a bit of char. The spigarello had a touch of acidity from some lemon that cut the fattiness of the heavenly ribs. Next a half order of fried quail. I don't particularly care for quail. But this was different. Great stuff and the signature plate of the place. And for good reason. I finished my meal with braised carrots that were wonderfully sweet. Some slightly bitter winter greens were a perfect contrast to the carrots. It's places like State Bird Provisions that make San Francisco a great food city. Yum. Yum. Yum., The idea is genius and the execution is well done. Not every dish that comes out on the cart is 5 stars, but every dish is inventive and daring. The atmosphere is lively, wine list is small and cheap, and the experience is fresh. Don't miss out., SBP is a brilliant new restaurant! There are so many great things to say about it that I don't know where to start!!! From start to finish I had an amazing experience here! The staff is highly trained, friendly and truly cares about their guests! I have some strange allergies (wheat, potato and peppers) and after letting our server know this fact I found out that she made sure to share the info with everyone who was passing food so that they could help me avoid anything that would be a problem. SO impressive!!!!And now for the FOOD!!!!! Holy Moly!!! The food was ridiculous!!!! We tried just about everything that was passed around. Favorites of the evening: crudite of mini vegetables and soft goat cheese with sesame seeds & cardamom, duck liver pate with almond cookies, glazed pork ribs with spigarello & togarashi, and the coconut-ginger-cardamom baba with hachiya persimmon. The oysters on the half shell were fresh and tasted like the sea. There were just too many delicious options to sum them all up here! The menu changes on a weekly basis so be ready to be surprised! Everything is fresh with a flavor profile that will knock you socks off. It is a bit pricy, so bring three friends with you and split the bill! That way you can all try even more items off the carts and trays! Go...EAT!!!!, State Bird Provisions is a shining example of why I love the food culture in San Francisco. The entire restaurant experience here is top-notch; definitely one of the best dinners I've had in the city. State Bird Provisions introduces a dim sum-style ordering process to unique, fresh, and flavorful concoctions, all of which were absolutely delicious.The large open kitchen in the front of the restaurant is definitely a nice welcome. You see a dedicated league of chefs preparing a countless number of intricate and interesting dishes. There are a few shared plates on the menu, and plenty more that they bring around the room on trays and carts. I love this process because you can see the food before you decide to take it, and you can ask questions with the dish right in front of you. I've never seen anything like this before at an American restaurant, and it really is genius. Be aware though: you will probably end up spending way more than you expected to, because it's pretty difficult (at least for me) to reject any of the dishes they bring around. They all looked phenomenal, and the vast majority of them were.----------------------------A group of 3 of us had the following:Serrano Ham w/ Persimmon: Fresh & tasty. I could eat these all day.Pan-seared Trout = Excellently-cooked trout.Beef Cheek w/ Bone Marrow Vinaigrette = Delicious. The Bone Marrow vinaigrette is incredible and the Beef Cheek was nice and tender.Flatbread with Oxtail and Curried Lentils = Warm & flavorful. Loved it.CA State Bird w/ Provisions (Fried Quail) = This was my favorite dish of the night. The fried quail was PERFECTLY fried and the meat was unbelievably moist. This is how poultry should be fried.Cavatelli w/ Dungeness Crab = Interesting flavor that really grew on me with each bite.Kimchi Pork Belly w/ Yuba Noodles = Very good take on the Korean flavors. The kimchi flavor is faint, but works very well in the broth. Pork Belly was nicely crisped.Duck Confit w/ Cornbread = The cornbread is phenomenal. The duck confit was good, but I wish they utilized something different with cornbread (ideally something like foie gras).Duck Neck Dumplings = Little dumplings that had a distinct duck neck flavor, but the dumpling skin was a little too doughy. Still good, though.Clam Sliders = The bun for the sliders were great, although I wish the clams were hot instead of cold.Goat Cheese w/ Vegetable Crudite = The goat cheese was great -- not too overpowering but still had a strong flavor. Goes well with the vegetables.Grand Total: $61.00 per person, including an ice-cold IPA (and tax & tip).----------------------------For a brand-new restaurant, State Bird Provisions blows many SF establishments out of the water. It serves up incredibly fresh, unique, and tasty dishes at decent prices. Make a reservation now and be prepared for an amazing night out., What do you mean it is tapas dim sum, oh.. yeah, it is just like that.Small plates coming down the isle. While you can order some other larger dishes from the menu. Sort of I can get my chicken feet from the cart, and order my chou mien from the menu.Everything is fresh, quintessential of new California cuisine. Standout dishes are:* Quinoa with small bits of red snapper and chrysanthemum: I couldn't say enough good things about this small creation, the favorite came out so unique and balance. My favorite.* Cavatelli with dungeness crab & tomalley butter: wow, please give me more! So light and fresh, the bread crumb added such interesting taste.* 7 spice bread with ox tail, sun choke sauce, and lentil: who thought about this?* Buckwheat bao (bun) with lemon cream: a piece of heavy that is only $5.I like the layout of the restaurant, completely open kitchen in the front. Everyone is friendly, the chef was near the door when we left, and chatted with us a bit when I complimented him on the dishes (I rarely do). Such humble man!Only complains are the place is noisy! It only died down after about 10:30pm. I could also see that if you are sitting in the back, you are in trouble! Cause all the deliciousness won't make it back to you. There is no good waiting area, but they actually can take your cell number and text you when your table is ready. Service is friendly, you can tell each staff knows the dishes well. Considering the quality of the food, this is a bargain place. We had a few drinks and about 10 dishes for two of us. $100 tips included.And open till midnight, heck ya!Visit this place before it gets publish, and the mobs swarm in., Came here with a girlfriend on a Saturday night ~10/10:30pm, past the dim sum-style serving time. We simply ordered from the menu.Our waitress was pleasant and very helpful in answering some of our questions about the menu. We ended up having:1. CA STATE BIRD WITH PROVISIONS This is a whole deep-fried bone-in quail. The provisions were lemon-stewed onions with shaved Parmesan. The bird was quite moist and delicious. It is a bit difficult to share as the bird is not deboned - you'll have to split it with some creative cutting. Best to eat with your hands to get all the delicious meat off the bones.2. MARINATED WILD MUSHROOMS w/ vanilla-parsnip purd9e & hazelnutsThe mushrooms were extremely flavorful and had just the right amount of tang. The hazelnuts gave the dish the right amount of sweetness and a nice crunchy texture combined with the soft mushrooms.I also had a glass of Temperanillo, which was very good. I enjoyed the ambience of SBP as it was equal parts rustic and modern. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. I'd recommend SBP for some quick bites as one of a few stops on a night out in the Fillmore neighborhood. Probably not great for a filling dinner but certainly a cozy, low-key date night nibble., 'Warning: There is no such thing as super sizing here. After a weekend of super indulgence at ayce shabu shabu and then buffet the next day, this place is exactly what I needed. Everything we had here was amazing. State bird, pork belly with kimchi , marinated wild mushrooms, duck dumplings and an amazing salad with bone marrow. This place is definitely pricey for the amount you get. But well worth it!', When an innovative restaurant opens up within a 3 minute walk from my house, stays open until 12, and takes reservations, I'm bound to give it a few extra brownie points (hence the 5 stars instead of 4). This place was definitely a win with a wonderful tapas concept and ever-changing menu. The small dishes fairly priced for the most part and had a few stand-out dishes:1. Braised Baby Carrots (really stellar, I hope this stays on the menu always)2. Farro with Wild Mushrooms (off the menu)3. Marinated Wild Mushrooms4. 7-Pepper FrybreadOn the negative side: I was not the biggest fan of the Grilled Chicories and the oysters were a little unexciting. A friend also found the duck dumplings pretty average.The service is wonderful and the waiter was very accomodating to my vegetarian needs offering variations of existing dishes so that I could try them. Can't wait to come back and try some new dishes!, I'm pretty stoked off of this place. My hood has been in dire need of a decent place to eat for far too long (the Fillmore is the ONLY place in SF with every possible fast food option in a half mile radius). Provisions is delicious AND affordable. I've been three times, each time with a friend and shared 4-5 plates, a couple beers (great beer selection including Stone Levitation Ale for only $4 bottle) and the highest bill was around $40.The food is very good.The interior is also a pleasant surprise.I'll be very happy to see this place stay consistent and in business., 'Dim sum style for casual upscale american food.Love the concept, liked the food, but they still need to work out some of the kinks with operations. Perhaps sleeker dim sum style food carts would improve the flow.Really enjoyed the variety of food and especially the deep fried quail Definitely go with a group of 4-8, so you can try all the dishes.', SBP opened New Years Eve 2011/2012, not quite seven weeks ago, so they still have plenty of room to grow and develop their menu. The food style is Asian/California/Italian. (Somewhat like the late-great-Oritalia on Fillmore.) SBP has a rather unique concept: A very abbreviated printed dinner menu, supplemented by small courses on carts or trays wheeled or carried by a friendly and knowledgeable staff to the patrons' tables. These latter plates are not listed on the menu, but the prices are clearly displayed on the carts and trays.Next time I go I probably won't order immediately from the printed menu, but instead take my first courses from the carts and trays, and possibly add some menu selections later.What we ordered from the printed menu:* Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakes... $6* Char-grilled chicories with yogurt, dates & almonds... $6* Halibut with hazelnut and mandarin... $18* Ricotta cavatelli with wild mushrooms & spinach... $16What we took from the carts/trays:* Raw vegetable and fruit with whipped goat cheese... $6 * Mushrooms with parsnip puree... $6My comments:The four small pancakes were fine, although they would have benefited from a dab of some interesting sour cream concoction on top. Also, the sauerkraut must have been cooked into the pancakes but it was not apparent in the flavor.The chicory greens were very good, if a bit acidic from added lemon, vinegar or vinaigrette. (Cooking these in the open kitchen may have contributed to the slight smokiness of the room.) The halibut was dry and flavorless in an unpleasantly acidic (again), very minimal, sauce.The cavatelli pasta was a laughably small serving. Tasty, but the mushroom-to-spinach-to-pasta ratio didn't include enough pasta, and was not satisfying at $16.The raw vegetables were fine and the whipped goat cheese was very good.The mushrooms and parsnip puree needs work. The cooked mushrooms should have been warmed (they were cold) and there was too little puree.Wine list is short but good (we had only one glass of Beaujolais) and the hazelnut apricot linzer bars (which were comped) were tasty. SBP needs to offer some heartier dishes. Also, for diners who might not be enthusiastic about the unusual flavors of some dishes, they should offer a few standbys with a more comfort-food orientation. They grill chicory, why not grill other vegetables and maybe potatoes with a romesco sauce (they like nuts at SBP)? Dial-down the acidic elements and offer dishes with more rounded flavors. Olive oil, anyone? How about some bread and butter? Most importantly, increase the serving sizes - we both left hungry having spent $81 including tax and tip.In the end, I do appreciate what they're trying to do and applaud their effort. The staff was very good. I will probably go back.Oh, yeah. Music choice was not so great. They're in an historic area of great jazz and vintage SF rock. Go for the jazz and leave Johnny Cash to the BBQ joints., While promising, some super groups just never quite pan out: Soundgarden + Rage Against The Machine (Audioslave) = eh.Sammy Hagar + Joe Satriani (Chickenfoot) = um, seriously?New Kids On The Block + Backstreet Boys (NKOTBSB) = actually... that might be the exception. I love terrible pop music. Secretly, I'm hoping one day for a Biebas duo to hit the road (Justin Bieber + Nick Jonas). Well, when I heard the news of a fresh concept combining new-American fare with dim sum just steps from my 350 square foot studio apartment, I was intrigued to say the least... and after being open for roughly four weeks, I was able to pop in and experience the magic of State Bird Provisions first hand. Suffice to say from the gaggle of glowing reviews accumulated already, you don't need me to reveal their gustatory super group concept won't soon be the Power Station of San Francisco eateries.Upon original speculation, I envisioned this place to be exactly like a dim sum restaurant with rolling carts chock-full of odd looking mystery vittles that you hope don't make you incredibly ill hours into the night. However, while that's certainly a staple standout of their dinner service, it's more of a fun attribute to a brilliant static menu. Still, fun, and incredibly uncommon. They encourage you to order roughly half of your menu items (small, tapas style) from the physical scribe, then treat your taste buds to a handful of the passed plates that do, indeed, arrive at your table by way of a four-wheeled tumbrel. It's really fun, and certainly a unique way to enjoy a night on the town.Spanning both the physical menu and the passed plates, you'll find items like Drake's Bay oysters in the half shell, vegetable crudite with goat cheese & toasted sesame, marinated halibut with yuzu-jalapeno vinaigrette, marinated mushrooms with vanilla-parsnip & hazelnuts, kimchi-pork belly & clam broth, glazed pork ribs, and at least 10-12 other courses appealing to any kind of eater. They even have one or two dessert items making the rounds throughout the dining room, and it's about as challenging as solving a Rubik's Cube to let the sweet treats drift off into the distance. I don't have as much of a palate for sugar, otherwise I'd have gobbled up those sacchariferous digestifs faster than a bee stung stallion.Changes of pace are nice when you've grown tired of the usual dining routine, and if the quality of taste and ingredients rivals a clever, outside-the-box concept, you're in for a real treat. In Lower Pac Heights, State Bird Provisions is that treat, and one I hope to indulge in far too often., At State Bird Provisions, it begins the second you walk through the door. You are greeted immediately by the kitchen and its staff, followed by a member of the incredibly friendly waitstaff, and then (if you are lucky), your well-appointed table. Everything at SBP feels intentional and refined without being stuffy or highbrow.For $80 including tip, we enjoyed 6 dim-sum style plates offered by tray/cart (including heavenly Drakes Bay oysters), 1 item from the standing menu, and two desserts in addition to the two beers we ordered while waiting for our table (reservations highly recommended as we lucked out on getting our spot and this place's popularity is soaring for good reason).All of the dishes tasted uniquely well-balanced--the menu here is an incredibly thoughtful fusion of local ingredients, distinct flavors and a wide variety of styles.This is a great place to go with folks who share a sense of culinary adventure an an appreciation for quality ingredients and service.Our new favorite restaurant!, What happened!??Its really embarrassing when you talk up a great new place to friends and colleagues and go for a second visit and it falls kind of flat. I had an outstanding experience when I first came here. My second visit with a friend felt like I was at a different restaurant. Most of the dishes we had on my first visit were not available. The dishes which were available on the menu last night were OK at best.I couldn't wait to come back after my try. After my second try, I just cannot recommend., Worst dining experience ever I'm the bay area. Poor service, forgot our order and below average food, good wine list, good food, interesting ordering method. passed like dim sum for some of it, and ordered off the menu for some of it. I'd pass on the crudites - it's just some weird-looking veggies likes romanesco with a plop of goat cheese, but everything else is quite good. And order the state bird, obviously. Kind of loud because it's all hard surfaces inside, if you're old and care about that sort of thing., '02.09.12 || bookmarked 02.01.12I was being a daredevil yesterday. I walked into SBP without a reservation, right when they opened. They were all booked up. People were lining up to get seated. We got snuck in, if we promise to leave within an hour so the table can be vacated for the people who had the foresight to make reservations.We wasted no time, and picked the small order of the CA state bird with provisions (fried quail) and the small order of glazed pork ribs with spigarello and togarashi.Then comes the fun part. Dishes come out in carts or trays, just like dim sum. And just like dim sum, they mark the dollar value to the back of your check, and tally the total afterwards.We picked the halibut tartare and quinoa with bonito-rosemary aioli (which, by far, was my favorite dish of the night); the duck neck dumplings in sauerjus; and the braised oxtail in seven-pepper flatbread.Wash it down with a large strong amber ale (that they have on tap), and we were good to go.Absolutely fabulous concept and experience. I am utterly surprised that this has not been done before, and I can wait to go back with a larger group to try even more dishes over a bottle of wine!Total damage for two: $55ADORE.', Great food, loved the waitstaff, and a cool ambiance. Every time I return I'm surprised by the menu in the most pleasant way imaginable., hit or miss place. a nice ambiance, attentive service, reasonably priced dishes but only a half of the dishes were as good as we had hoped. I wouldn't call it hyped up but it's not worth 4.5 stars based on my experience.its dining concept is different; more like an upscale, contemporary American dim sum place? we had about 12 dishes and about 6 were very good and the other 6 left us hanging. for a sucker for pork belly, it hurt my soul sharply that they didn't execute two pork belly dishes quite well. however, their quinoa + halibut dish, duck rillette, trout dish, dark chocolate-pair desserts were really good. I would definitely come back and try different menu but for now, 3 stars feels right to me., This was the most enjoyable meal I've had in 6 months, in spite of a tour of Bay Area Michelin one-stars over the past year. My gf said the dishes were hit or miss, and I must admit we had a couple that were not so great, but I was impressed enough to write a review. And any place worth reviewing always has something like 863 Yelp reviews so it's seriously easy to skip writing one.First, the dim sum concept is brilliant. The problem with tapas is that I always feel ripped off, even at fine places like Bocadillos or Ramblas/Locanda. You don't know what you're going to get, and you spend a small fortune to get your fill. But here you get to see the plate and its price, and hear its description before you take it. It is a perfect solution. It helped that the prices were very reasonable.Second, the execution was great as well. The service was friendly and attentive, and the dishes inventive and tasty.I didn't take notes, but my favorites were the kimchi pork belly clam stew, flatbread with ox tail, and duck prosciutto with dried persimmons. Also excellent: quinoa, marinated mushrooms, and goat cheese with vegetable crudite. The radicchio beet salad reminded me of cole slaw -- not necessarily a bad thing, but did not do justice to the fresh beets. And I thought, exactly as another reviewer remarked, that the sourdough pancakes from the menu were doughy and undercooked.I'm sorry I missed the fried quail and will certainly return to try it., This is why I live in San Francisco. I just wished I still lived in this neighborhood and I'd be here twice a week. Fantastic food, attentive but not intrusive service, and downright reasonable prices. Such an interesting concept and a great way to try lots of different offerings at a restaurant. I recommend everyone go to this place before the Chronicle publishes a glowing review and it becomes impossible to get in., 'The question looms: Where can I possibly eat after this ethereal experience?I woke up dreaming of all the intricate, well-balanced, shining flavors I experienced last night over what felt like an extremely decadent dinner. First off, the service was exemplary. We were mainly in the capable hands of Sarah, and she was friendly, professional, intuitive... (She even asked at the beginning if we had any food allergies. ) Sarah paced our dishes in a way that placed the strongest, heartiest fare toward the end so we could really taste the subtleties of the earlier dishes. The timing at which the dishes arrived was perfect too! (Again, intuitive.)We started with provisions delivered by cart. Before being seated, we were very curious (and skeptical) about the concept. When the cart first arrived, we got it!! To be able to see the colors, the presentation, experience the aromas at the time of ordering was a total treat. We started with: oysters, trout tartar with quinoa, green onion flatbread with cheese, duck neck dumplings in sauerjus...The oysters were perfect: the flavors delicate and balanced, with a bit of daikon and reminiscent of Japanese flavorings.The trout tartar with quinoa had delicate, layered flavors and the most amazing texture...Green onion flatbread with cheese: Had such a nice undercurrent of a citrusy flavor (like lemongrass??) That just kicked it to the next level.The duck neck dumplings were probably the star of round 1. Not to be missed!!Next, we really couldn decide what to order off the menu as it all sounded amazing. Soooo, we ordered almost everything: chicories, sourdough-sauerkraut-pecorino-ricotta pancakes, state bird (quail), trout with garum butter, glazed pork ribs, ricotta cavatelli dumplings, beef cheeks with radishes and bone marrow...It sounds like a lot of food, right? It was! My dining companion is a sous chef so we decided to go in for the full experience. :-) It was totally worth it!chicories: tangy, bursting, balanced with the almonds, dates, yogurt...The panckaes: I was actually not too psyched about the pancakes. When they arrived, however, they blew my mind! We ate them Mmmmming and Mmmmming when my dining companion realized it was evoking a childhood comfort for him: perogies!!! He was right. State bird (quail) - the breading was perfect, the tangy onions served as the bed for the quail were divine!Ok. You get the point.The star dish for me: the ricotta cavatelli with wild mushrooms & spinach. Wow! Wow! Wow! the mushroom flavor stood strong as did the flavor of the perfectly-textured cavatelli. My favorite. Desserts:milk chocolate sesame crunch with clementine cocoa jambeer begnetsrhubarb crisp with rosa gardenia ice creamThe desserts were as innovative as they sound. The begnets and the sesame crunch took the prizes from our table.All of this plus beer, wine, a pomegranate spritzer ... still reasonably priced for a nice dinner out for 2. It also made for a great date: discussions of the food, sharing the experience, discovering the nuances: great date spot!Make a reservation. They are busy!', 'Awful, awful dining experience. There was not one good thing I got out of dining at State Bird Provisions. I going to try to keep this story short, for my sake, because I really don wish to relive this horrid occurrence any more than I have to. I know that State Bird just opened about a month ago, so I really trying to avoid sounding overly harsh, given that the staff is new, blah blah. I can forgive things like slower seating or minor mistakes like that. But what happened was not minor. Our easy-peasy short two-item order was somehow lost between our table and the kitchen (distance of 30 feet, no joke) Really? REALLY??? I can hardly think of anything worse than completely omitting an entire table orders.So there we sat, the boy and I, 45 minutes later still waiting for our plates, being bullied (by our own hunger, not by SBP staff) into ordering dish after unsatisfying overpriced dish of their so-called dim-sum-inspired-a-la-carte fare. What a crock. I hate to admit it, but it was this exact (seemingly) fresh idea of trollying around small plates that lured me in the first place.I finally watched in astonishment at the chef sitting down to eat his own dinner, and noticing that most of the kitchen was shut down. Oh my Gee Ohh Dee. Asked our server how much longer our plates would be. She comes back and tells me nonchalantly Your ticket was never put in, oops. No apology, not comps, nothing. WOW.To boot, I actually ordered the quail- the State Bird with Provisions. Cue Alanis Morrissette Ironic, if you please. Tell me, how can a restaurant overlook a ticket for a homonymous order? If that not dropping the ball, I really don know what is.', This was my favorite dinner restaurant in all of San Francisco. I loved the concept of this restaurant (maybe because I'm a huge fan of dim sum and I get more excited when I can physically see the food I'm about to order in front of my face). My recommended dish would be the braised ox tail flat bread that came around on a tray (not on the menu). The pork ribs were also a favorite at our table. It can be on the pricier side (I think we spent about $100 including tip for just the two of us - but we kind of splurged since it was somewhat close to Valentine's Day) but if you pay attention to how many dishes you're consuming you can stay way below what we spent. I recommend trying the desserts too. A lot of the time desserts can be an afterthought but we went in knowing we wanted to try at least a couple and thank god we did. My favorite dessert was the pear ice cream sandwich. Seriously. Try this place if you're in Pacific Heights.God I want to go back to San Francisco., 'Eating here is like going to a friend house for dinner, a friend who can cook and has a fancy kitchen. These guys are like mad scientists producing delicious pieces of art...lots of layers, texture and flavor. Ie come here a handful of times and each visit feels like the first, sometimes they take former dishes and reconstruct them as a new experience the following week. That why I love coming back here, that and their passion that leaks through (from the chefs to the servers to the diners). Oh, and also (if you don mind standing) the best seats in the house are to the right of the Chef expeditor...it the standing bar in front of where the cookinis happening so youl get first dibs on what comes out. It also feels like youe hanging out at the counter of your friend fancy kitchen. Casual and yum!*note* also admire the asymmetrical ceramic plates Chef Brioza made during his break between Rubicon and SBP...a true artist!', 'One of my favorite new places. It fun, different, new style (American Dim Sum) and super creative.We went with friends and we able to try a bunch of dishes, and here is my list of must havesTuna Tartare & quinoaDuck Rillette with almond iscuiteef tongue, potato and veg pickledDuck neck dumplingsCA state bird with provisionsTrout with hazelnuts, and brown butter (!!)Ricotta cavatelli with wild mushroomsand my need to try list:Sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino & ricotta pancakesdesserts were playful, and my top pick is the Warm cornmeal custard, huckleberries & walnuts, while the milk chocolate sesame crunch and clementine-cocoa jam was awesome as well. spiced butter cookies with carrot jam was refreshing from the common overly sweet desserts.we got here for super late reservations, 10:30, but everything was still available. we were given the dim sum menu with the regular menu, but did get to see the cart pass by. for 4, plus at least 9-10 drinks, price was really reasonable.', 'OK, so we wanted to try this American dim sum place. It ended up to be quite an expensive meal and we were not even half full. The idea might be cute but half of the dishes we ordered were just ok. The beef tongue, the beef cheek salad, tuna with Quinoa, chips with their own dipping would be the only dishes I recommend. Their signature dish was over rated. The quail itself is very tender but the batter was way too thick. Only go there if you want to try something different but not necessarily looking for a nice dinner', 'I really wanted to like this place, but I was pretty underwhelmed.First off, the format is cool in theory - small plates come around a la your typical dim sum restaurant. i get it, youe trying your best at shifting some paradigms. that fine. However, one big difference is that when the dim sum steam cart comes around, the food that is presented to you is actually hot because, well, it coming out of a steam cart. At SBP, the hot dishes that come out are often times just room temperature, because theye been hanging out for a little bit before they get to your table. Sure there are dishes that don need to be hot so those make it to your table at the temperature you expect. I can get over the dining experience issues, but the food is where this place fell flat. With a few exceptions everything was pretty lackluster. Of all the dishes we had, the standouts were a fluke sashimi with blood orange vinaigrette and a dessert consisting of creamy polenta with huckleberries. Both were superbly executed.beyond that, the flavor profile of many of the dishes seemed, in the words of my wife, rounded. I describe them as muddled, unfocused, and even downright bland at times (pseudo-casear salad - i looking at you). I know it isn fine dining, but i expected a lot more from the kitchen, given the hype. For the record, duck pate does not work well with cornbread. Bone marrow in dressing on a beef cheek salad comes across as a ham-fisted. The texture of a hazelnut does not add the right kind of flair to a mushroom salad. Many of the kitchen decisions just seemed clunky. A for effort but C for execution.And If i paying $20 for FOUR pork ribs, i expect them to be the best ribs ie ever had. Sure, they were falling off the bone, but to me, they were rather dry and poorly seasoned. Il head down to Texas and get a bucket of them for that price and be a much happier customer. To their credit, the staff was awesome, service was great, as was the booze selection. i know i fall in the small minority on my assessment of SBP. I can accept that. Maybe I just hit it on an off night. However, with all the other tasty options available in this city, i don think State Bird Provisions will be getting another chance to send me home with $100 less in my pocket.', This is my new favorite restaurant. Really, truly incredible. I had Valentine's Day dinner there with my lovah and we were both blown away. We ordered ten items and eight of them were the best thing ever (two of them were pretty good, but we probably wouldn't order them again). I was going to write about each dish but it would take forever so suffice it to say it was amazing. Just go. The beer selection is small but good and very cheap. Overall, the restaurant is pricey, but it's so special that we'll definitely treat ourselves on special occasions. The flavors! Oh, the flavors!, 'State BirdThis place is what happens when dim sum meets tapas meets hipster -- but in a good kind of way, with custom made, reclaimed teak, welded blue, red and wood carts pushed by the chef and sporting $6 provision size dishes that circulate the restaurant floor all night like a Jersey boy looking for a hot play. And these provisions are good! I actually stood at the kitchen counter, which is an excellent way to enjoy your meal, so long as there isn a long line of folks standing right behind you. At the counter, you get time to watch your chefs make your food, admire their craft and craftiness, and even get to throw in a word or two in between plates running in and out of the broiler. It a real experience and not just a meal; a sort of Disneyland for the culinary senses. When it came down to food, I had the crudite with goat cheese and toasted sesame that was quite fresh and refreshing, although not particularly accented one way or another. This I followed with the duck rillette with almond biscuit. Now, this is where you need to pause for a moment. Reading this dish description you might find yourself very underwhelmed. I mean, what the big deal about duck rillette and almond in particular? It not like ducks and almonds grow on the same tree or feed from the same terroir after all. Well, think again. This combination of rillettes with a financier like biscuit is absolute genus. Whether accredited to Stuart (the chef) or not, I give him full credit for making them and making them oh so well. This is quite possibly the best preparation of duck rilletes that Ie ever had. The secret, I told, is in the use of duck fat instead of butter to plump up those financier biscuits. And, it tells. These things are so rich and so perfectly matched to enliven the otherwise lean rillettes. The one-two flavor punch is just to die for. I applauded them -- with my hands, as did another patron as she was leaving for the night. Truly, there were accomplishments worth an ovation at this place.This stellar dish was followed by two dishes which did not particularly overwhelm my culinary sensibilities. They were good, but somehow they did not move the needle for me far above just nice. These were the duck neck dumplings in sauerjus, which are a kind of gyoza/pierogi inside a small soup made of sauerkraut juice, and the cauliflower, lentils and sunchokes, which was a curried dish that seemed to neither scream lentils, nor cauliflower, nor sunchokes and yet still managed to stay mildly nice. But no worries, this was just a short plateau in what picked up again into a nice crescendo: the sourdough, sauerkraut, pecorino and ricotta pancakes and the green garlic bread with burrata. Ok, the pancakes I am just partial too. Theye fried cheese pancakes. What can possibly go wrong with that? Nothing. And although I don recall a strong taste of sauerness, I did like the seasoning quite a lot and especially the ground coriander that appeared all over the plate (idiot alert: i may be wrong about it being coriander, but that how I remember it now). This dish was fine enough on its own, but then I saw one of the chefs roll out a fresh roll of green garlic bread, where the green and the garlic are mixed into the fresh dough which is then -- gasp -- deep fried. Oh boy, now I was getting short breathed with excitement. Fried dough with fried cheese?! oh, dear lord. And, the lord did provide. What a wonderfully fun dish. Served freshly fried, the burrata cheese is nestled inside of its bread roll like a puppy in its crib, and you just wanted to eat it, as my sister is ought to say of puppies in cribs. And eat it I did. Nomnomnom good.But that wasn all. Oh, no. To top off my savory dish extravaganza, I took the half CA state bird: a deep fried quail with pepitas on top of a lemon-onion concoction that all put together is like a mad twist on chicken piccata meets the deep fryer minus the waffle. Deep brown in color and tender and juicy this dish was just pure success, and I am honored to have shared in it. What a great recommendation from the chef, who had been guiding my selection throughout the night. Another great perk of standing at the counter and not being a lazy bum at a table (I venting a bit for not having wanted to wait 30 mins for a table to open; it acceptable. Look it up in the Yelp rule book). And so, my meal ended, but not the fun. Dessert. It has to come. I mean, it has to, right?And come it did. Twice. A truly multi-orgasmic finish to an already stimulating meal is what I got when I ordered the world peace peanut muscavado milk and the warm cornmeal custard, walnuts and huckleberries desserts. Yelp is limiting how much I can write about it, so youl have to go try these on your own. And, if I was living in San Francisco, I be telling all my friends about this place, because without doubt the bird is the word. Word.', As much as I want you to read this review, you need to do me a favor first and open up another window and make a reservation at State Bird Provisions. Go ahead, I'll wait. Trust me, it's a good idea to do so now while there are still reservations to be had...if my dinner last night is any indication, a seat at SBP will be a hot ticket in no time. While being listed under tapas, the cuisine at State Bird Provisions is more like Hipster Dim Sum (Hip Sum?) You have the option of ordering off a set menu as well as picking items off trays and/or a cart being wheeled around the dining room by a friendly, knowledgeable staff. We ended up trying at least 10 different items and left stuffed to the gills. Highlights included duck neck dumplings, beef cheek salad with a bone marrow dressing, homemade potato chips with trout roe, duck prosciutto, pickled veggies with beef tongue, duck rillette with the most amazing financiers and pork belly & clams w/ kimchi stew.Yes, I listed a lot of highlights but truth be told, everything was fantastic. Actually, the one item I wasn't over the top excited about was the fried quail - it was good but I was glad we ordered the half portion, the hip sum items proved to be the stars. Oh, we also had some great desserts, definitely leave room! (and at prices ranging from $2-$6, it's easy to order a few to split) State Bird Provisions may be my new favorite restaurant in San Francisco (sorry, Frances) It's easy to create your own 10-12 course tasting menu without breaking the bank, and the atmosphere is incredibly hip and laid back for the quality of the food being produced. Good stuff, I'll be back soon!, 'We were excited about this concept. Small plates on carts. While we could see the work that went into each plate we found most of the dishes missed the mark of something remarkable. The deserts were something to return for. Only wish there was more to each plate.', Move over Yank Sing. It's finally happened. With the use of fancy ingredients, cute stationery, and hip decor, you can now watch your money drop out of your pockets with each stamp on the check while your hunger pangs laugh at you for even trying. State Bird definitely puts an interesting (read: western) twist on dim sum. I don't think we did a very good job ordering. There was a dish with sesame seed encrusted goat cheese and tiny little vegetables, that while absolutely adorable, was somewhat bland. Then there was a dish with potato chips and some kind of a salmon and dill dip. I can appreciate that everything, including the chips, were probably made in-house, but aside from that, it felt as though it was another thing we could've thrown together on our own. Finally, we ordered a dish with three rounds of some kind of meat (turkey? chicken? I don't remember) that came with (I think) a braised cabbage and prune. It was a tasty combination.Our server and everyone who walked by were intent on reminding us that we could order off the menu at any time from any person. Perhaps we should've followed their persistent insistence. Next time, for sure., Great Great Great!Everything about this place is Great!Great Ambiance, Great Food, Great Location and a very enjoyable experience.This is a unique restaurant that puts it's own signature on the Dim Sum approach to food.Hosts bring fresh, hot and cold dishes around to the tables for guests to sample various dishes.Each dish is prepared fresh and the menu rotates, and portions of the menu are constantly changing, so you can be sure to get a fresh and different delicacy on each visit.I LOVED the Duck Neck Dumplings. I hope the chefs' keep this one as a regular staple on the menu!!!, 'Great food and great concept! Excellent service!!!', 'The food was very tasty, but the problem for us was portions. We spend $120, had three glasses of wine, but were starving by the time we left so we got take out chinese. The pork ribs--$20 for two ribs? Ridiculous and in fact outrageous. Dont go hungry or prepare to stay hungry.', Very solid restaurant. Had the potato chips with creme freche and steelhead roe.,Braised/BBQ'd ribs, some pancake deal, this is pointless, read the other reviews..., Provisions is a really fun place to have dinner. They take a different approach to the restaurant experience by placing the kitchen at the forefront of the restaurant so you can see all the action! The fact that the food comes by you dim sum style is great too - you don't have to think about what to order and you can see exactly what you are getting. It takes the pressure and guesswork off so you can relax and let the friendly staff take over. There is one thing that could use some improvement - certain dishes don't make it all the way through the dining room. So depending on where you are seated you could have last dibs.Overall, a fabulous place for a casual yet sophisticated meal and a whole lot of fun! Needless to say, everything we tried was terrific and I would go back many times over."|1
52|topolobampo-chicago|Excellent. Scruptious haute Mexican cuisine. Do the tasting menu with matching wines, you will not be disappointed. You may be thinking it's too spendy for Mexi, but really, it's so worth it., Can you say best meal EVER? And I'm a snob from San Francisco. The food tastes like winning the lottery. Rick Bayless, I want to kidnap you and force you to cook for me every meal every day., Went here last week for my girlfriend's birthday. Edit on 22 Apr 06 - said girlfriend has been my ex for some time now... I have to admit that I was really looking forward to it as the both of us have seen Rick Bayless' show(s) on television and have salivated over the dishes we've seen him prepare. I ordered some appetizers & an entree and my girfriend ordered the tasting menu (5 courses paired with wines - including dessert) I'll briefly cover various aspects of the restaurant and rate them on a scale of 1 - 10: Food: 8 Some dishes were absolutely amazing - the gaucamole was the best I've ever tasted, the soups were so flavorful and had just the right amount of kick and the corn/mushroom tamales were outstanding (and I don't even like mushrooms!). Unfortunately, some dishes just didn't grab me - I had an excellent piece of rib-eye that just didn't seem paired very well with the mole sauce that it came with - I did my best to eat the rib eye and avoid the mole. The lobster that we received was quite a bit smaller than I would have expected as well. Additionally, there was a pork dish that neither myself nor my girlfriend thought was very good. The wines that were paired with the courses of the tasting menu were good overall. The only wine that knocked my socks off was the desert wine. The rest were either good or pretty good. They were matched well with the courses. Presentation was outstanding. Atmosphere: 9 The interior of the restaurant is beautiful - warm, cozy without being overly romantic, not too many tables and wouldn't feel crowded even if it was full. Outstanding Mexican themed artwork (presumably by Mexican artists) adorns the walls and the kitchen can be seen at the back of the restaurant - something that I like. Honestly, I don't like the shared entrance with Frontera Grill. I think it would be much nicer to have separate entrances. It's fine if you are going to Frontera but seems a bit awkward going to Topolobampo. Service: 9 Our server was very good and had a thorough knowledge of the menu. She made some good recommendations and, obviously, some not so good ones. However, each person has their own tastes so I can't really fault her on that. I would have to say that our particular server seemed to be describing wines to us as if she were repeating something she had memorized rather than having tasted the wines themselves. A lot of descriptive detail but without confidence or passion for it. Price: 3 Our bill well exceeded the $200 mark. It was much closer to $250. For this one reason I cannot give the place 5 stars. Everything here is priced at the extreme upper end so be prepared to drop a lot of cash if you want to come here. I understand that Rick Bayless is one of the world's best but I feel I paid up somewhat for the name rather than for the food on this particular night. I didn't see him in the restaurant as others have mentioned so perhaps he wasn't cooking?!? I don't know. Summary: As I said, the food was good but a bill for two exceeding $200 should result in food that rates a 10 out of 10 for EVERY dish. I'm not exactly dying to go back but I might try it again if the opportunity presents itself - their menu changes every 4 to 5 weeks so it could be a whole different experience., 'Just amazing. We had the tasting menu with wine pairing plus added champagne and the ceviche sampler because we could not resist. We were definitely happy we added the additional ceviche (even though it was too much food, if you like ceviche it is a must). Innovative cuisine, but not too strange/out there. Also, I did not feel like Bayless was trying too hard to make his food different. It felt genuine, authentic, and just well-balanced. Planning on going again real soon. Also, priced in the right range- about $300 for 2 with the add-on and worth it.', 'I went there for my birthday in February and was really looking forward to this dinner. I thought the food was great, and the atmosphere was very cool and interesting, however I actually liked Frontera Grill a lot more. I would save your money and have a just as enjoyable, but cheaper evening at Frontera.', Mexican food is not necessarily my favorite cuisine, but this place blew me away. I would come for the ambiance alone (romantic, quiet, classy). The food is professionally presented, savory, and has the perfect blend of spices. The guacamole was excellent!Due to the price, I would suggest this place for a special occasion. The treatment alone that you'll receive makes you feel like a celebrity!, I've been wanting to visit Topolobampo (fronterakitchens.com/res43_) for ages, and finally now I have - I wish I'd been here sooner! The food is fantastic. Everything looked so great we couldn't decide. The waiter told us we could split a soup for two, and we're glad we did - the Azteca soup was definitely big enough for two! I had a fantastic dish of mussels and bass with a mole sauce; and my lunch companion had a roasted chicken dish, also with a mole sauce. Everything was just lovely about the restaurant and the food was amazing. Definitely pricey - so if you're on a budget this may be a more special occassion type place. Most appetizers were $8-13, and luncheon entrees were $13-19. The menu changes monthly, and Rick Bayless emphasizes organic and sustainable farming in his menus. Closed Sunday and Monday; serves lunch 11:30-2, and dinner 5:30-9:30 Tu-Th, til 10:30 Fri-Sat. Reservations highly recommended (opentable.com is a good source)., I don't think you can top this food anywhere. And the Margaritas are the best in the entire city. The service is friendly; the atmosphere is artful and tasteful, and every time I go here ends up being fun...I always make friends here! Try the sopes for an appetizer and the kahlua pie (has a better name than that, but I forget now) for dessert....sensational!, I'm not sure if Los Angeles has a Mexican restaurant that can top this place in terms of ambition. Haute is definitely the word. My fiance and I went for the trio of Ceviche for starters. To drink, a Ginger Margarita. Both solid. Then we went with the tasting menu. There were definitly some exceptional morsals, as well as some relatively lack-luster tastes. Regretably, they were out of the duck that evening. Was the dinner worth the $200+ for me and my fiance? I personally don't think so...but i would go again for the hopes of tasting those amazing and totally original tastes that were hinted at in our dinner., 'Haven eaten here. Haven set foot inside. Once I do, though, Il change my rating (because I personally am not a fan of when people rate places theye never actually, oh, I dunno, been).That being said ... You would think that a mastermind like one Mr. Rick Bayless would keep in mind the walkability of the sidewalks outside his fine establishments (cuz you know, there two in a row ... Topolobampo & the less swanky Frontera Grill). It like walking through the rain forests there! They have this outdoor seating area that surrounded by a wall & several large pots of flora. Beautiful, right? Right, until you consider that there are also trees at intervals spaced out along the sidewalk. Trees whose branches hang dangerously low for this 5.5 in flats woman. Add onto that the fact that the valet station (a podium where 2-3 guys loom) is directly next to one of these trees & pots & you have a virtual Safari Planet trying to walk past!You don have to be Lara Croft to explore the tasty treasures of Topolobampo, but you should carry a machete to navigate your way through the front of the restaurant.', 'Oh, sweet lord--the food here is stupendous, phenomenal, abso-freaking-lutely delicious. Justin and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary (yay, us!) at Topolobampo on Saturday and were both astounded by how wonderful the food was. We been wanting to visit a Rick Bayless restaurant for a while (especially after watching him duke it out with that douche bag Bobby Flay on Iron Chef America) and Topolobampo was the perfect spot to celebrate our special occasion. While we were both a bit disappointed that Chef Bayless had traveled to Mexico with his wife for their annual October visit, I can imagine our experience being any better (although I be happy to give it another whirl when Bayless is in town). The food, oh, the food! I love that much of it is sustainably grown and raised, locally produced, yada yada... It very cool that Bayless shops at Green City Market and that he a member of the Slow Food movement... He cares about his ingredients and food and it shows. The amuse bouche was a wonderfully rich guacamole served with cucumber and thinly sliced turnips, a nice alternative to rather filling tortilla chips. We each ordered margaritas--a traditional one for Justin and a seasonally-inspired version for myself. Both were expertly prepared, shaken tableside and deliciously well-balanced. We ordered the ceviche trio for our appetizer and it was simply incredible--again, the balance of flavors--spicy, smoky, slightly acidic--was perfect. It was one of those appetizers that I really wanted to hog for myself, but you know, it was our anniversary and it was probably nice of me or something to share my favorite of the 3 ceviches with Justin and let him have the last bit. I was not as generous with the next dish... empanadas stuffed with spiced goat (apparently raised exclusively for Bayless, and after eating it I can help but feel that a noble calling) and shredded carrots. Justin got a salad and too bad for him! Actually, he seemed to enjoy his salad very much, but my god, those empanadas were like little savory cookies or something. The pastry was so buttery and flaky, the meat and sauce on the side a little spicy... If only it had been an entree option, too. Ah, but then I woulde missed out on an awesome halibut dish served with a jicama and pear salad, these delicious layered potato thingies and a sweet-spicy sauce. Justin had paella and I don even remember if I got a sample, I was so enamored with my dinner... Now here something to note--my husband is a fairly quiet fellow. I the rambling chatty one, the over-dramatic one, the one who makes the noise... You know Topolobampo has to be awesome if it elicited multiple outbursts of Amazing!, Wowww! and Man.... with voluminous incredulous head-shaking from my husband. And these weren just mutterings--this was out-and-out loudness. THAT is some serious kudos, kids... all while Chef Bayless was out of town. Our compliments to the folks running that kitchen and turning out amazing dishes. The service was excellent and well-informed, from our Gomez Adams-esque host (seriously, he looked like an older version of the TV Adams patriarch) to Jill-squared, our server and sommelier both named Jill, to each individual who brought out our dishes. Everyone was attentive and knowledgeable, but never overbearing. Sommelier Jill was outstanding--I don know much about wine, but her pairings made flavors even more interesting and forward... it nice that they offer quite a few 1/2 bottles so each person dining can pick something that works well for their meal. Topolobampo is a wonderful restaurant and even though Chef Bayless was out of town AND we had to sit next to this annoying art-school chick* we had already endured on the train, nothing could deter me from giving this place 5 stars. This will not be an every day restaurant for us due to the price, but it a fantastic treat and a lovely place to celebrate a special occasion. *I typically don have anything against art-school people in general--just the ones who are so self-important it hurts to overhear their conversations. Luckily, Justin awed outbursts drowned out her theories of abstraction.', 'Probably the best upscale Mexican Ie had in Chicago. Seriously good food.You won find a taco or burrito anywhere on this menu. Its truly authentic REGIONAL Mexican cuisine. Probably unlike anything youe ever had before, and probably unlike anything else you can find in Chicago.SERIOUSLY good margaritas. You have to have their margaritas. They serve them straight up martini style. Probably the best margarita Ie ever had. I drooling thinking about one.Lunch range is between $$-$$$ range. I assume lunch is cheaper than dinner...', I ate here with some friends for a birthday and was less than knocked out by the food for the money we were paying. I will say that the staff is incredibly friendly and knowledgable about the menu, but (and I realize this is actually sort of the point of the joint) the menu was a bit constictive for my tastes. I ordered the crab legs and was disappointed by their size, and while I've heard folks rave about their margaritas, I personally thought they were a tad watery tasting. Maybe too much ice was shaken too long during prep?, I completely agree with Sunny G. People seem to love Topolobampo, but I can't understand why! I ate at there for my mom's birthday a few years ago and hated every bite. My then boyfriend, now friend, just ate there again and said it is still awful., 'Whoa...the reviews are so dang binary here...either you love it or you hate it. Geez, I feel like this is such a polarizing place. I heard about Bayless, but con who wants to pay $25 for some Mexican food? It like paying a ton of money for fancy Chinese food or some Korean food. Just not worth it...(can you tell I building up to something?)...wait for it...So we met some friends here for a surprise b-day party. I read some reviews, thought okay...whatever. We came, we saw, we kicked some food and margarita ASS! I thought the food was very good, and I thought the fru fru margarita were very tasty. I believe the entire dining experience is a lot about mindset...and my mindset that night was to have fun, drink up, and just enjoy. Okay, so I don like paying a lot of money for Mexican, Chinese, and Korean food, but if some really does it right...I mean RIGHT...then it is worth it. This night, this dinner...it was worth it.', Let me just preface this review by saying that the service at Topolobampo is outstanding (the margaritas are great, too). And the food is good BUT...I'm just not sure that I fully understand this whole pseudo-gourmet Mexican food subgenre. Seriously, can someone explain? I mean, I have a sophisticated palette, but I really feel that all the Mexican fanciness served up at Topolobampo is totally unnecessary (and expensive). Furthermore, I used to live in Tucson so I know what really good, authentic Mexican food tastes like, and its definitely not what I had at Topolobampo., The food is good but I was simply NOT blown away...well, maybe by the prices, but that's another story. I was treated by out-of-town friends and they, too were under-impressed by the cuisine. Don't misunderstand me, though, we all thought the food was very good and I am glad I got a chance to try Topolobampo, I just think I would rather spend that much money elsewhere. The highlight was our Obama sighting...he and his wife walked in to dine shortly after my friend's story of his McCain sighting earlier in the day at Reagan National Airport!, I have been to Topolobampo twice and both times I was pretty disappointed. #1 --- Food is OK. We had the typical order like enchilladas, etc and nothing was phenomenal. #2 --- Service is not great. Our waters were not filled and our waiter was preoccupied and did not come around to see if we needed anything. #3 --- Ok I am probably a big dork by saying this, but the first time I ate here, I was with a group of friends and Rick Bayless was walking around. My friend shook his hand and said he liked the food. Rick was pretty rude to us and just walked away. I guess I thought he would be nicer because he seems nice on his PBS show. Anyways, that is a side note... = ) #4 --- Is this really authentic Mexican food? I know Mr. Bayless goes to Mexico all the time and people say it's authentic, but I guess I was expecting a lot more flavor with his dishes. I never plan to go back here but everyone else seems to give good review, so you should check it out., We arrived a little early and my in laws decided they would politely ask if we could be seated sooner...when the maitre-d heard he turned all beet-red and angry. It was like we asked him to shoot his own dog or something.I knew it would be good for a laugh. I've waited for HOURS here, even with a reservation and the food and service never lives up to the hype or wait. There's so many other great dining options in Chicago it seems a shame to waste your time on this one., I constantly comb this country for great Mexican food. Authentic Mexican, prepared perfectly.Sadly, there are few places at all that have the craft and execution in perfect harmony...and this goes for Mexico as well.There is only one place in the entire U.S. that gets five stars from me, and that is Topolobampo. There are tons of worthy taquerias in California and elsewhere, but they are apples to the orange of 'Alta Cocina' at Topolobampo.If you are one of those folks who watches TV Food Network and lives for great ethnic eating expereinces, you must put this restaurant on your short list. Don't expect Charlie Trotter's 13-step dishes here. But expect a full representation of the great, classic high cuisine dishes of Mexico made perfectly. And a sommelier to match wines to your courses, perfect service all around.Side Note: I told the waiter that I was a huge fan of Rick Bayless, and that I had been inspired by his PBS cooking series in the early 1990s. Five minutes later, Rick showed up at my table to say hello. (It was Saturday night at 8 p.m., he was in a cook's jacket, dirty.)Other Side Note: Fronterra Grill, also on the property, is fantastic as well. And they serve top-top notch margaritas. Again, best of class in the U.S., I have never had Mexican food like this before. All other Mexican dishes I've encountered generally consist of tacos, burritos, and nachos. None of that to be found here. Of course, I knew this beforehand, so I wasn't really surprised. None of the mentioned foods are to be found on Rick Bayless' menu. All the dishes consist of exotic ingredients, including soft-shell crab, duck breast (which is what I had), halibut cheeks, blue marlin, etc. The beer selection is mostly Mexican beers, obviously, but I got to try some new ones besides the traditional Corona I was used to. Their wine selection is huge as well, and I also noticed that the staff was very knowledgable in terms of the alcoholic beverages available, both wines and beers. The meal was topped off with a cup of coffee with dessert that was made with one of those French press thingys, so it was very dark and rich with a hint of cocoa in it.All in all, it was excellent. One of the fanciest meals I've had since I recently moved to Chicago. Food and cooking is truly regarded as an art here. Only giving 4 stars because I was expecting more flavorful, filling food...there were moments where I was still craving a huge Chipotle burrito., 'We walked through an alarmingly noisy room into a very quiet one. Terrific ceviche (only rivaled by Delacosta - which was insane), outstanding drinks - mexcal margarita (server described it as smokey - and it did taste of top shelf tequila around a campfire). Awesome ice creams - young coconut (with cheesecake bits). Entrees were good, but have had better (black cod and pollo). Service was first rate, and that five stars worth!', 'I went to Topolobampo on Friday lunch hour in order to try the more upscale Rick Bayless establishment. I walked in at one olock and was immediately seated.My best attempt at a description of the dcor is Tim Burton meets Mexican Day of the Dead Celebration. Dark colors with folksy art (not cheap mind you). I am glad however that they seated me in the front dining room because I think in the back I would be too light deprived.I was immediately greeted with the now commonplace query, Bottled or still water? I rarely drink water so an additional ten bones is not worth it to me. My server came by with the drink and lunch menu and I asked which seasonal Margarita he recommended. Blood Orange. Not so exotic (had an awesome one at Tom DouglasPalace Kitchen in Seattle) but great for a warm day. I must say the salt rim was incredible! I am guessing but I think it was mixed with candied edible flower pieces. This drink along with complimentary guacamole to start got my appetite going in high gear. The guac was nothing special, but nice and creamy with flecks of sun-dried tomato. The chips however were definitely house made and a million times better than those being passed off as Frontera chips at the grocery store. I ended up ordering the trio of ceviches to start, followed by the camerones. The ceviche sampler was quite disappointing. The dish was served with more chips in those separate martini-style glasses. The first was a marinated white fish in a citrus marinade, topped with ribbons of cilantro. Honestly all I could taste was an overwheliming attack of lime juice and more bits of sun-dried tomato (it was kind of a theme). The second contained both shrimp and fish, but basically came off as a glorified smoky tartar sauce. There must have been an adobo chile in there somewhere, but sadly it made little difference. The last actually turned out to be my favorite. It was squid in a super spicy and citrusy marinade. There were bits of julienned lime rind and other elements that made it pop. Although usually not the biggest raw squid fan, this was quite nice.After polishing off my Margarita I decided it was time to try a new varioation of my current favorite libation: a Tonic Mojito. Instead of rum they used a white (silver) tequila and it had a strong cucumber presence. This drink was perfect for my shrimp entre. The camerones were served alongside a pyramid of brown rice (although it tasted more like a pearl barley) and sat in a creamy and complex sauce with grilled fiddlehead ferns. I thought the shrimp were well prepared and instead of eating the rice I used the tortillas they brought (same ones they use to make the chips for sure) to make little saucy shrimp packages. I think the fiddleheads, for sharing such a prominent role in the description on the menu, were relatively side-lined. More Fiddleheads!Well after all this food I decided I couldn pass up dessert so I ordered a chocolate cappuccino and a chocolate tartaleta. It was infused with lime, covered with a quenelle of cream on top of tequila-infused white chocolate sauce. The dessert was brought out to me by the manager who engaged in a lengthy food discussion with me (love it when men talk food!). In passing he said they usually make this tart with guajilla chiles and I think I would have liked it much more as such. The cappuccino was great and I could have licked the white chocolate sauce right off the plate.All in all...Topolobampo is the big brother who as a child seems so cool, but once youe all grown up is just another regular Joe. I would save the dinero, go to Frontera and out for drinks and dancing all in the amount you would spend here.', 'Took my wife here for her birthday. Great food, great service but be prepared to spend some serious cash. They offer fixed price selections that included wine which looked great. I passed because I felt that $75/person was a little above what I wanted to spend. In retrospect, I should have gone that way because I ended up spending well over that with only one shared appetizer, two main dishes and drinks. Would have given 5 stars except for the over-the-top prices.', Like a few of the reviews here say, the food is yummerlicious, service is top notch and ambience perfect. But I, too, prefer Frontera Grill though I will admit, there are stuff on the Topolobampo menu that you can't get at Frontera Grill... so you have no choice but to return :) Either way, you can't go wrong with either. Topolobampo for a quieter, more fancy (and expensive, obviously) meal.qomt.blogspot.com/2007/043_, We went here on a special occasion, and it was an amazing meal. The drinks were excellent (and potent!) and I really shouldn't have had two before the meal. The rest of dinner was like some sort of magical dining fantasy. I had this wonderful marinated fish wrapped in a banana leaf served with veggies and roasted plantains. My husband had some kind of meat dish ( ireally can't remember what exactly except that it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious). The dessert was out of this world as well. The prices definitely make this a special occasion restaurant, but I would consider returning if i ever do anything worth noting., 'Last night I was treated to an absolutely fabulous meal at Topolo. It was really sensational. Our waiter, whose name we unfortunately never learned, was excellent. He really gave us some great information. We started by ordering some drinks. I wanted to order a raspberry mojito that was on the beverage specials list, but our waiter wouldn let me. He told me that the drink was it or missbefore suggesting a special margarita with cucumber. I really respect a waiter who is willing to be honest like that. I rather someone tell me not to order something I may not like, then let me order something and be disappointed. So, right away I knew we were in good hands.We really had a hard time deciding what to order...there were so many things on the that sounded fantastic. Our waiter mentioned to us that the tasting menu was inspired by the staff trip to Mexico. ..yep, that right, Rick and Deann take the entire staff of their restaurants to Mexico ever year.In any event, our waiter gushed about the tasting menu and said it was the best he could remember in the 7 years he been there. I was surprised by his willingness to offer substitutions for anything on the tasting menu. Eventually, we caved and went for it...without substitutions.The amuse bouche was guacamole with jicama and cucumber slices. And, while all the tables got it, our waiter let us know that he took the liberty of ordering some guacamole for you, which of course made me happy. The first course was a trio of ceviches. The first was a white fish (maybe marlin?), avocado, and lime, the second was shrimp and baby octopus in a tomato sauce, and then lobster, watermelon and habanero. All three were incredible.Second course was a gazpacho with a lime ice floating in it. It was good, probably the last remarkable course, but it was still good.Third course was lobster stuffed with shrimp and garlic with a black bean sauce and tortillas. It was so delicious. I wanted to lick the bowl...seriously delicious.Forth course was pork two ways. The first preparation was steamed in a banana leaf overnight. It was in the most delicious sauce. The second preparation was smoked...the pork was served with black beans, pickled red onions, and sunflower sprouts. Again, I wanted to lick the bowl.Final course was, of course, dessert. A trio of tiny desserts. Coconut tart with Mexican sour cream, mango sorbet, and cheese cake. All three were fantastic. I was so pleased with the meal, it was really spectacular. The timing, the service, the food...everything was amazing.One final funny little story. The table next to us was 2 older couples. They bought cookbooks and then begged the waiter to send Rick Bayless out. When he finally obliged, the table had Rick sign the cookbooks and then one of the men said, Before you go, Rick, I have a question for you. He proceeded to ask Rick who was more nice, him or Charlie Trotter. Rick blushed and said, It not hard to be nicer than Charlie Trotter! Priceless.', 'Yet another one that I just don get...maybe I just slow? Or uncultured?Closed out my recruiting season with a bang with lunch at Topolobampo. We were seated right away and the service was excellent, although the food did take a long time (2.5 hour lunch) and the waiter was a bit odd.The lemonade was delicious. Otherwise, my food, while good, certainly didn stand up to the rave reviews bestowed upon this place. I had a carpaccio style tomato salad appetizer, which was just blah (and the coconut milk gelatin cubes were simply weird). For my entree I chose the combo, which included sliced pork in mole (the pork had zero flavor on its own, so thank god for the mole), black beans (admittedly very good), empanadas (hardly any filling) and chorizo (by far the standout).It was a fine meal, but I don pay $50/person at lunch for fine. My office does. And then I complain about it.Life is good.', Topolobampo is a must for any Chicago foodie. The ceviche is spectacular! Took my now-husband here for his birthday and Bayless was walking around the restaurant during dinner, visiting with patrons. It's nice to know that you don't have to sacrifice service when you go to a high-end dining establishment. We were seated right away and the sommelier gave us some great recommendations for wine. I wish we had gone with the prix-fixe menu, ordering dinner separately came out to almost the same price., I've eaten here twice now, and I don't understand the hype. Good food, but nothing spectacular. And with such a hefty pricetag.. I've left feeling ripped off both times.I also don't care for the atmosphere here., 'I went here after a terrible breakup with my past BF and this place turned my frown upside down. I got to meet Rick Bayless and I must say, he is a special, special man.My dinner was absolutely perfect. The wine was fantastic, be it I drank quite a bit, and the desert was mind boggling! We spent about 2 1/2 hours here just soaking in what had to have been one of my top ten dinning experiences of all times. A must go.', 'Had the tasting menu. There are three tasting menus to choose from, which was new to me. But three tasting menus, where you can see what is coming next, kinda takes the fun out of it, no? We had the mole and the celebration tasting menus. Seemed like the mole was better, as the sauces made all the dishes and they take all day to prepare them to perfection. I could go on and on but I wont - everything that needs to be said was said below (great service, attention to detail, quality) .... except perhaps that the the mole tasting menu was the better of the two we had. The other tasting menu was seafood, perhaps next time', Don't go here if you want your typical Tex-Mex. Topolobampo is a place for a great fine-dining experience. So far everything I tried here looks beautiful (you eat with your eyes first) and tasts amazing. My favorite is the stuffed poblano pepper as an appetizer. A lot of dishes are Rick Bayless's take on popular Mexian foods - both old fashioned and contemporary and each dish shows how creative and talented chef he is., 'Expect to have a dining experience here, no quick service. They truly treat you! T his is an upscale version of Mexican food and although I enjoyed it, I don think I would have enjoyed it as much if I had to pay the bill.The most authentic, fresh tamales I have ever had!. My soft shell crab wasn all that soft and hurt going down my throat...but the batter was light and flavorful. I would go back and try Frontera next time....', Fun to PronounceI have to admit that favorite part was saying it in the baseball announcer roll with dramatic pauses. The Guac comes as their bread and butter but it is ordered like it is compliments of the house and you are special. I'm no sausage king of Chicago yet so I figured this out quickly. The waiter was patient and attempted to be very accommodating. The policies of switching items on the tasting menu's etc. are a welcome policy by Topo. Our Margarita recommendations for the ladies were good and enjoyed. Having been introduced to Michelada in Las Lisas, Guatemala several weeks prior ordered one to see Topo's spin on it. Instead of a Gallo and local version of V8 juice, Rick's creation was Pacifico Claro beer and what tasted like a smaller portion of fresh blended and strained vegetable juice and lime. This is a bit lighter than the version I've had and was pretty clear this was the case because my drink was pink instead of nearly red. This breaks my policy of no pink drinks; I wish I could've had a paper bag around it. However, the chipotle powder rimmed glass is a very nice kick to round it out. Somehow I got chipotle pepper in my eye so I was of the conversation for a few minutes.The trio plate was good, chips dipping in to margarita glasses filled with shrimp, etc. The mushroom filled tortillas were fairly good and the nice warm tortillas good. I still recommend Rick bring over an indigenous tortilla lady to toss them. Something tells me there aren't enough work visas for the Tortilla lady skills, but there damn well should be. The ceviche was quite tasty. Overall, however, there was one dish. One dish to trump them all. It was the lamb. Small slices of succulent perfectly cooked (definitely not overcooked) tasty still pink and glowing in the center coins of delight. Rick Bayless had a little lamb little lamb, Rick Bayless had a little lamb and it tasted frickin' great today!Other than the lamb we were more impressed with the dessert. I ordered some mezcal hot chocolate which was a nice nightcap and the ladies ordered some crepas and a chocolate tart which I snuck some bites of and enjoyed thoroughly. With our work and class schedules our pseudo double date went with a later 9pm reservation thinking that small plates restaurants generally shine at this time. We were definitely closing out the place, being one of the last groups to leave.Topolobampo vs. Frontera GrillThey are not all that separate; They have the same host station, the receipts say Frontera Grill, etc. Your menu choices are fewer, seemingly less authentic, and of course more expensive. WARNING: Menupages link listed above right now is for Frontera, not Topo. Reliance on it could cause your wallet to esplode.Disclaimer aside we had a good time at Topo. I did have more fun saying the name all day long and perhaps may use it as a substitution for expletives., A little history: A sister restaurant to Frontera Grill, one of the best gourmet Mexican restaurants in Chicago. You might recognize the chef Rick Bayless who's written many cookbooks and frequently appears on the Food Network. (You might also recognize his brother Skip Bayless who appears on ESPN a lot and is a sports journalist). The Bucktown resident, Rick Bayless has many things going for him, but he still is on the line almost every night making sure each dish is perfection. Topolobampo is the upscale version of Frontera Grill and is considered fine dining. Rick uses a lot of Tex Mex style infused with traditional Mexican and of course his own spin on it. The wait is not as long to get into Topolobampo. The drink list is the same as Frontera Grill--- the margaritas are very delicious. Try the ceviche appetizer it comes with three different types! The entrees are amazing. I got some type of lamb dish. Desserts are really good too. I don't think anything is just average there. It's all over the top! Since I was with a bunch of Oklahomans they wanted to say hi to Rick who's from Oklahoma so he came over to our table to greet us after dinner. He was a really nice guy and comped all of our desserts. Whether you are from Chicago or from out of town this is the place to go for a great time! Definitely a Chicago treasure., 'Unique upscale Mexican cuisine, a little pricey. try it.', 'Went here for dinner a couple nights ago. I love mexican food but have never really done upscale nuvo mexican . The best part of the meal was the Guacamole that had cucumbers and garlic. The worst was the (in your face) Sommelier that came over even when she was not asked to. The food is good but I am not sure that it corresponds to the price tag. The waiter was attentive but did not really seem to know the menu or able to aid with suggestions.', 'It a little known fact that Topolobampo is a Mayan word for gold mine. Like the precious mineral, it takes effort to obtain it and not everyone appreciates it once you do, but the expense and thrill are worth it for most.Ie visited two times, and didn even get a glimpse of Bayless. I think they should have someone on staff dress up and rush through the dining room on nights when he not there. Just to make the evening complete.', This was my first visit to one of the restaurants under the direction of Rick Bayless, the gringo who purports to bring the cuisine straight from the heart of Mexico north of the border (aren't there already thousands of Mexican-owned restaurants doing that?), and I came away disappointed. Granted, it was for a work-related party, but that doesn't mean I was distracted from the lackluster cuisine.Let's start with the good. The two stars I give it represent how I was serviced and sloshed. The wait staff were smart, quick, nice, helpful, and wouldn't take any backtalk. When I was curious what rum they had used in a drink, one brought out the bottle and a tasting glass, and the poor quality of the Mexican rum (I know my rums) didn't overshadow his gesture.And the margaritas were great, and clearly of fresh juices. They were a treat, and surprisingly so were the mojitos. The beer selection was, like my favorite beer brands, all Mexican. The only qualm is about the wine: boring California brands, and nothing Mexican. But no biggy, since I prefer my booze and beer (in that order!).The atmosphere, however, left something to be desired, in the dim and windowless basement which left me happy no claustrophobes were part of our party. Now for the food. What did we start with? Guacamole, oh yeah, I almost forgot. That's right, forgettable guacamole. It was fine, but I've had better so many times, and it was served in menial portions that were situated in the kind of smooth bowl that doesn't want to let you scoop with any ease.The only vegetarian appetizer on the pre-arranged menu were cheese quesadillas, except that an Ecuadorian at my table and myself both felt quite strongly that this was much more of a small Andean/Isthmian empanada than any quesadilla we were expecting.Now for the main course, the real loser of the meal. Enchiladas in green sauce, again the only veggie option. I love enchiladas, and I was not rocking these. The sauce, at least I thought, tasted like some noun that would turn your stomach, and the whole entree left so much to be desired. Well, Bayless, you have a lot of work, and some luck, if you want another try from this customer. Frankly, I'll be fine with my neighborhood taqueria., This restaurant is a really unique experience--fine dining with a Mexican flair. Unfortunately, I don't think the food quite matches the presentation, but I would still recommend going. The sommelier gave us some excellent wine recommendations and you are able to have a festive, fancy dinner without feeling as if you have to keep your voice down. The margaritas are excellent!, 'A little background: being a many-generation American, the only ethnic foods of my childhood were the Mexican dishes that my parents learned during their years living in southern Arizona when they were first married, so for somebody as blindingly white as I am, Mexican food holds a special place in my heart. As such, Rick Bayless has always been one of my culinary idols; his idea of researching so deeply the authentic cuisines of Oaxaca and the other regions of Mexico and bringing his own interpretations to them has always been wonderfully appealing to my palate.I had a chance lunch at neighboring Frontera Grill in late 2001 and I had been to BaylessFrontera Fresco at Seven on State at the end of 2006; Ie also been a long time fan of his public television show Mexico: One Plate at a Time. I have a certain familiarity with his cuisine and the flavors it entails, so an opportunity to dine at Topolo was something I relished weeks in advance. But after reading all of the disappointed reviews here, I was prepared for a disappointment. Perhaps I should not have been so predisposed in my biases.After the much-discussed amuse of guacamole with cucumber and jicama, three of the four of us decided on the three tasting menus. What followed was less surprising than it was simply amazing. While I had small samples of the other two menus, I personally had the seafood tasting menu.The first course, an escabeche of Kona Kampachi (a farmed yellowtail) with soft beets and onion, was spot-on in its ability to bring an acidity and spice to a raw fish without overpowering it. It was a bit tangled in a forest of Baylesssignature microgreens, but the relatively strong flavors of the fish balanced everything out very nicely; as much as I could be concerned about the subtlety of the fish being lost in the dish, my fears were allayed by the absolutely masterful integration of the different ingredients.Second was an ever-so-slightly smoky pan-seared scallop sausage that paired beautifully with an Arbol-sesame salsa. The latter, really nothing more than a chile-infused tahini, put an awesome creamy smoky finish on a dish with plenty of flavors to stand on its own. The celeriac mash with this dish seemed a bit of an afterthought, but was wonderful nonetheless.Third, trucha en tamal was an inside-out trout tamale. A fish filet stuffed with goat cheese and sweet corn was definitely the least adventurous but perhaps the most tasty of all. The plate sauce, a crema of chilaca chiles, had a very familiar taste to it, something that reminds me of the pasilla fascination Ie come to expect from Frontera and its empire.Fourth was a Maine lobster with black bean chilaquiles, fried onions, and queso anejo. Perhaps the only (mild) disappointment of the evening, the (albeit perfect) lobster meat seemed to exist in isolation from the rest of the dish. The presentation was incredible, though; the half lobster with the claw rotated up and a nest of toppings was visually stunning.Dessert was a fitting end to a wonderful meal: a tangerine tart with an absolutely amazing meringue and an startlingly lemony ice cream. This course also had the best wine pairing of the evening, a Rieslaner Beerenauslese from Pfalz / Rhine Palatinate.Of course, just as no dinner is complete without some wonderful coffee, no review is complete without a treatment of the restaurant after-dinner offerings, and Topolo did not disappoint: they had a press pot offering of a fair-trade coffee from Bolivia roasted by their friends at Intelligentsia, a wonderful ending to a wonderful meal.Perhaps just because I was so set to be disappointed, the total experience of the meal left me satisfied in a very deep and significant way. Many kudos to chef Enyart and the entire staff. Should an opportunity arise in the future, I would absolutely jump at the chance to dine at Topolobampo again.', There are few experiences that deserve negative stars, however the time I went to Topolobampo was one of them. If there was anything they did correctly, I must have missed it. From the hideous wait times, to the flavorless, microscopically portioned, insanely expensive (and lukewarm) food, to the inept and babbling waitstaff, this goes down as the worst dining experience (particularly based on service and utter failure to live up to even the faintest hype I'd casually heard about the place) that I've *EVER* had, highbrow, lowbrow, anywhere inbetween, at home or abroad.Words fail me for how to describe just how monumentally bad this entire experience was., 'First Impressions: You enter the restaurant through the bar of Frontera Grill. All your senses are hit at once, the art stands out above them all. Cocktails: The bartender was a bit short, even arrogant, but it was 8:00pm on a Friday. She a tequila elitist, and didn seem to care for our order of a Margarita. She insisted we choose one from their menu. We left it up to her, and enjoyed a couple of very tasty cocktails. Dining Room: The restaurant is slightly insulated from the noise of Frontera Grill. The sounds that do seep in only serve to add to the atmosphere.Staff & Service: The Topolo staff is highly trained and very friendly. Within 10 minutes of sitting we had met, and had conversations with the host, our table captain, 2 servers, and the sommelier. Our questions were answered with patience and accuracy. It is important to note that the staff and the kitchen are extremely flexible. They are willing to make any substitution and meet practically any request. The table next to ours asked for a vegetarian tasting menu, even though one does not exist. We noted with interest that the kitchen brought out course after course of veg dishes that were not even on the menu. Food: My girlfriend and I each had different tasting menus, so I was able to sample 10 courses. The food was unique, flavorful, visually stunning. I think the only adjective I would not use is incredible. There are better menus in Chicago for less money.Wine: Unbelievable - 10 glasses, all unique and expertly paired. Best pairings Ie ever had. The knowledge of the staff and sommenlier was also superb.Conclusion: Wel be back, but probably for an a la carte meal next time. 4.5 stars if Yelp allowed it.', Overpriced. I went here for Valentine's Day and though I love Rick's show , the portions were ridiculously small and the food wasn't worth the 100 price tag. Cost for the four of us: 450 dollars. Had I been provided with a nice steak or something substantial, I would have added half a star more.Drinks were bad--I ordered a mojito and it was not good. At all., 'This is the most expensive 1star I have ever given to a restaurant. I am crying for my boyfriend who spent over $200 for the worst meal ever. First, our reservations weren ready for us when we arrived, which is fine, ok. We got seated and it took awhile before our waiter even came by to say hi and get our order. Ok, they are busy. I get it. We ordered the celebration tasting menu, thinking if we are going to go all out, this would be it. We had also ordered a margarita (it was average) and I ordered a limonda (it was alright as well). We had a free appetizer before the first course, it was guacamole...or I assumed it was because it tasted like salty paste. It was SO salty, I couldn even taste the avocado and I downed my water after one bite. This was the beginning of the end. Our first course was some type of sald with crab (imitation I may add!) radishes, beets, blood oranges, green stuff, more green stuff and parmesan crusted crackers. Oh..and more salt. Second course was..the most ridiculous. We had a bowl of 2 quail eggs with bacon bits and 4 beans. They poured on a broth (or salt water, again) into the bowl. If youe never had quail eggs, they are the size of a quarter. My boyfriend throat wasn feeling too well, but after the gargling on this course, it felt much better. Thank you topo. Third course was lobster. It was at most, average. At least it wasn overcooked..or salty. Served with corn tortillas, and lots of garlic. I had a similar dish with beef at Frontera Grill.Fourth course was lamb racks. I would tell you how mediocre it was, but I took one bite and decided I was just done for the night and looking forward to dessert. The boyfriend didn like the mole sauce, but the lamb was tender so he ate it with the corn tortillas provided.Our dessert arrived, it was a trio of cheesecake, some shaved ice, and ice cream infused with mescal with flambayed morang. Everything was drizzled with a raspberry sauce which was way too tart for me. The cheesecake was ok/good, the shaved ice was strawberry and mint which...isn impressive, and the mescal ice cream was gross.On top of all the bad food (and your serving size and the price), the service was horrible. All the waiters were mumbling while describing the food. The wait between each course was ridiculously long. The whole meal took 3 hours. The atmosphere isn even impressive. I think we saw Rick Bayless. So disappointed at this place. Sadly this is truly over hyped.BTW, this is not what you would call good mexican food. Try Mayan Mexican Palace if you want good cheap mexican food. I much prefer Carnivale over Topolobampo. Better guacamole, better food, better atmosphere, and better service. And you don leave feeling like you got ripped off.', 'The food was authentic and amazing. How can I not love Rick Bayless when he is more obsessive about my food and my culture than I or most of my people are? I only wish there was a wonderful Mexican restaurant like this one in the Bay Area so I could go and spend my whole paycheck there every month.', 'The food was unique, fresh and amazing. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and wine pairings. As a matter of fact, he actually OFFERED to substitute courses on the tasting menus, in the event we didn like something. Of course, you have to be prepared for a fat bill, but the food and service are worth it. My ONLY complaint is that after calling ahead to inquire about the dress code, and being told by a snooty woman that it was business casual, which means no jeans, half the dining room was dressed in jeans. That really ticked me off.Con, Rick, educate your staff. If you allow jeans, but don encourage them, say so!', WOW! What a lovely experience. And I am not just saying that because Rick Bayless was sitting across from us while we ate...Went here for my friend Susan's birthday before she left for Paris the next day. She and her sister, Amy, and I really splurged. This is not your average Friday night dinner spot. It is really pricey...Entrees, on average, are about $35. And you don't only get the entree...you have to try some of the ceviches and sopas.We started with the trio of ceviches, which were all delicious. I skipped the second course, but Amy had the tortilla soup and Susan had the butternut squash soup. Both of them enjoyed their dishes.I had the fish and shrimp entree, which came atop a black bean sauce. SOOOO wonderful! The fish was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. Susan had the lobster, which, even though she tried, was really messy to eat, but absolutely wonderful. Amy had the pork dish which came with plenty of pork and fresh tortillas. Then we had to have some dessert!!This review would not be complete without my giving props to our server, Oliver. He was AWESOME!! He knew so much about the wine and the menu, was really engaged when he came to the table (even giving us his opinion on American Idol and Top Chef), and really took care of us. He really helped make the evening fun. Thanks!!I will definitely go back, but I will have to save up. It was definitely out of my price range, but definitely worth it., Holy Mole Batman! I took my wife there for her birthday and completely fell in love.We both had one of the three tasting menus matched with wines and were in complete and utter awe.Each course was presented and explained to us, and while most did not LOOK like Mexican..every aroma and flavor was there. The wines all matched perfectly.My wallet was significantly lighter, but we both walked out of there thinking when we could possibly go there next. It didn't stop the next day either. It really is THAT good., 'Went for a business lunch!It was great. Not as expensive as the dinner menu. Oh and celeb chef/owner Rick Bayless sat us at the table. How cool is that? Great place:3 people ate the most expensive dish on the menu + 2 appitizers + 6 Margaritas (2 each) and the total bill was $118....', GOOD STUFF: Manager's cute son Mango dessert Seeing Rick Bayless in the flesh Cherry chocolate beerBAD STUFF: Small portions Fatty steak Dowdy staff Poor valueI will not return., I took my parents here for their 25th wedding anniversary, and they really loved it. My boyfriend and I were a little worried because we are vegan, and we just planned on eating chips and guacamole. Our once-vegan waiter came up with a five-course vegan meal for us accompanied by a vegan wine flight. I about died. It was amazing. The staff was fabulous. The only complaint I have is that I was wasted when I left--and that's not really a complaint. If you're going to do the wine flight, don't start with a margarita--it knocked me on my ass. I felt buzzed immediately., This review is just for lunch. I went for a group lunch with a bunch of coworkers...we actually made reservations for fontera but somehow managed to get seated in teh Topolobampo section...I was a little nervous at first about the price until i saw it was very reasonable! Entrees were about $15-$20 and while they didnt have much in the way of apps for the table I was really pleased with the menu. I am a huge Rick Bayless fan and had the pleasure of him making dinner for me at Steppenwolf once (or rather I worked the dinner and he was nice enough to feed us as well) so I was very excited about lunch. I had the chiquiliquiles (i know i murdered the spelling there)-- with a mole sauce and veggies instead of eggs. OMG is the only thing i can say. I am not usually a mole fan, actually i kinda hate mole but this was the best tasting mole i've ever had! The whole table raved about the gauc and we actually took some back to the office for snacks later (i should mention that this wasnt encouraged and our sever seemed a little taken aback by our request but fulfilled it happily!)Most of my coworkers got a combo plate thingie...which they all raved about. And my boss got the shrimp entree...which he loved!Topolobampo is now my GO TO place for a nice lunch in river north! The manager was very involved in our service and was very helpful with little tidbits about our food. As someone who worked in fine dining for many years I definitely saw the efforts they take to train and retain good people....Well done!, I recently met a friend at Topolobampo for dinner. She was in Lake Geneva, WI visiting her family (she is from Denver). She planned to take a train down and had made reservations for 5:30. Ooops - she missed her train! So, she hopped in her car and hadn't anticipated a 3-hour drive! Traffic was horrible. I got to the restaurant on time and told the maitre-d. She said no problem - let them know when she arrived and they would seat us. 45 minutes later, My friend arrived and lo and behold, they had a table for us! They waited on us as though we were queens! I had a couple negatives though. Recently unemployed, I decided to try to limit drinking and spending. Unfortunately, while waiting for a table, I had to PAY for chips and salsa! And they guy gave me a weird look when I had water instead of a drink. Then, when we got to the table, I ordered the cheapest Margarita. I couldn't see spending 9-13 bucks on the smallest margarita ever. I got the 7-dollar margarita. The guy who took my order kept trying to get me to get the more expensive drink. I just smiled and said no about 3 times. Then, when I ordered 2 appetizers to total 27 bucks, instead of ordering an entree of 35+, I got a weird look from the waitress. She then treated my friend as the most important person and me as secondary. I still spent 60 bucks and 11 bucks for valet. Ouch! I knew it would be expensive, and MAN did it taste GREAT! I had the salmon app which was raw slices of salmon with some tasty salsa on top. I had the tamale app and it had goat cheese and bone marrow inside! YUM! I practically licked that plate! I was very full ! OH yea and we shared the appetizer of ceviche which had 3 different fishes in three ceviche sauces. WONDERFUl! So perfectly cooked! Tender fish. I thoroughly enjoyed it! The man who sat us told us to try to be done by 8pm since we were 45 minutes late. The waitress told us not to worry about that, which we thought was great. We did end up being there until about 9:30! About 3 hours!! We also had Cafe de Olla, which I LOVE. a french press with orange peels infused into the coffee with Mexican brown sugar and other spices. I would get that again and maybe make it sometime! I loved it. I expected the cost, so that wasn't really a problem. Just didn't like how they treated me because I was worried about cost and limited what I spent. Heck. I still spent 60 bucks!! geesh! My friend considered the tasting menu but for 90 bucks, you really get too much food to really enjoy it. THEN, you still have to pay for your wine. She had a 20-dollar glass of wine. I can buy a GREAT bottle of wine on sale for 20 bucks and it would be better than that glass of wine. I hate the overpricing of liquor. Overall, though, we were very happy with the food and with the flexibility of sitting us even though we were so late. It was a Thursday so very busy!, I was here last week with my husband for our anniversary and had a great dinner. The food and service were excellent.My husband ordered the trio of ceviches and I expected to try them but ended up eating a lot because they were so good. I was expecting smaller portions from other reviews but they were decent sized. We shared the ceviches, and a soup, we each had an entree and shared a dessert and left stuffed. We're both big eaters so if we leave a place really full I don't think you could say they have small portions. The table next to us had the tasting menus and seemed to have good size portions as well. The downside, I would say, is that it is not cut off much from Frontera which hurts the ambiance. They should have a seperate entrance and restrooms., If taste of food were the only factor considered, i suppose i would give Topolobampo a 4 star. True, it certainly takes Mexican cuisine to another level. Unlike any Mexican i've ever tasted. We started with a free quacamole--nothing really special about it. except it came with cucumber slices. I would have preferred good ol' tortilla chips, actaully. We shared a trio of ceviche--very good, but not that different from the usual. the 4 of us ordered different entrees--lamb, pork, salmon, and mahi mahi. Mahi--very very nicely done. pork-quite tender. lamb-well executed. Salmon--so so. Most had Good, rich flavors, strong sides, yet just a bit exotic and unique to know that you are not eating at the mexican place at the corner of your block. Hot chocolate was soothing and cinnamony, but one could easily make that in any home. the goat cheese cheesecake is quite good. different. crepes--overpowered with caramel and raspberry. So, food itself--4 stars. but let's consider that each entree is around $35. and the restaurant is pretty much a part of Frontera Grill. the noise and the music from there made conversation difficult. some dishes were a bit mundane. But service was warm and freindly. All in all, 3 stars. I had so wished that it would be a mind-blowing experience, but left a bit disappointed., I was here a few months ago for a business dinner and the meal was memorable. Didn't have the luck of seeing Rick Bayless in the flesh, but I coped. Food was refined - had ceviche that was fresh and tasty (with sufficient acid, as they would say on Top Chef), and a beef dish that was very well seasoned and cooked. Others in the party ordered the lobster dish and it looked and tasted great. In the end though, I don't know that it was so good that I would want to go back again with friends. It felt oddly stuffy (for a Mexican joint!) and the meal was certainly very expensive for what it was. And while the food was good, it wasn't so amazing that I would crave to go back unless I get to expense it. Good thing it's downtown because I couldn't stop having them mango mojitos., If you read any of my other reviews you will know that we go on a lot of work lunches for birthdays and stuff, and we have been here 3 times I think. It is my boss's favorite restaurant in the world! He loves Rick Bayless in all his splendor. With that said the price might seem steep, but we could go here for every birthday lunch and my boss would be happy! So I get to enjoy Topolo without having to worry about the cost!! Fantastic!Everytime we go there we order a ton of different things. We tend to pass everything around and share every dish, which is a wonderful way to experience many things. And since the menus are seasonal, some of the dishes won't be back ever!!!I can't even get specific on what I liked, because it's been a year since I've been there, but everything that we ate was wonderful. If you are a vegetarian or a carnivore there is something on the menu for you! The moles are AMAZING! I would definitely try something with a mole. Everything is mouth watering and very flavorful.The service is fantastic and they are not snooty at all there. And I have seen Rick Bayless there walking through the restaurant...very exciting!, 'Very good lunch -- came here with some good company. Had some ceviche and the mini tacos to start with and the Oaxacan sampler for the main course (got to try a few different tastes). Ended the meal with a chocolate cappuccino, which was excellent. Very colorful decor, and I could certainly hear the people at my table. Service was OK, although I did have a little trouble understanding the guy. Would come back here again.'|1
53|tru-chicago|'After talking to a couple of folks in Chicago on what is thee restaurant to visit on our trip over there, the restaurant that came up was Tru. First off, gentlemen need to wear a jacket at all times. A little more strict than French Laundry. The service was out of this world. For example when they filled my fiance and my glass of water, two waiters came up from both sides of the table and at the same time filled our glass doing a courtesy once they were done. The food was French Fusion and we opted with the 3 entree dinner. it started off with beef tartar (excellent presentation and mixture of flavors) and foie gras (nothing too special). Main dishes were the veal trio (a little disappointing and the sweetbread sucked) and the lobster (can I please have a little more lobster meat?) In between we were given soups on a spoon here and there. The stand out of this place was dessert. Dessert included:cheese platesmall root beer floatschocolate and blueberry soufflespresso mousechocolate indulgencelittle French cookieschocolates to go All we requested was for cheese and chocolate indulgence. It helps to talk about the Cubs in this town. Overall, food was slightly above average, dessert was excellent and service was outstanding. PRICEY $$$$', Everyone should experience Tru once, but just once. I went with my coworkers to Tru about a year ago and was very curious to try one of Chicago's most famous restaurants. It was one of the finest dining experiences I've ever had from the caviar staircase to the diploma they gave me at the end of my meal to celebrate 5 hours at the table. I think I may be too ADD for this restaurant, but I definitely app recited the experience., 'We went about a year ago and it truly was an experience . . . a very long experience. The meal was an amazing melange of fresh flavors and artistic presentation, but by the end it was a blur. Thank goodness for the print out at the end of the meal describing each course in the tasting menu! We got such a kick out of the service. . . It was like a well rehearsed ballet - each move was choreographed. As dishes arrived at the table they were served in unison and revealed with a flick of the wrist. I have to admit that the service was borderline intimidating and definitely too stuffy for my taste.', I wish everyone could go to this place just once...I would rate this restaurant the best in Chicago - Trotters has great food also, but Tru has better ambiance and service. Don't miss the caviar staircase, and especially the cheese plate. Just don't eat out for a month to save up cash, and set aside five hours for the full degustation menu...it is SO worth it., Rating: Superb Phenomenal, creative, classy. Some of the words that immediately come to mind when I think of my visits to Tru. One of the finest restaurant in the city, without a doubt. Having been fortunate enough to try many top restaurants in the country, Chicago's Tru ranks up there with the best. I first encountered the talented Executive Chef Rick Tramonto at Trio Evanston and his style, selection and implementation of the menu items is truly (sorry-couldn't resist) spectacular. Definitely get the Grand Tasting Menu, incorporating a wide variety of courses giving the customer a solid feel for culinary nirvana. If you go to celebrate a special occaision, be sure to mention it when making a reservation as the staff is extremely attentive and will even create a customized menu for you--a must if you want to recall the whirlwind of preparations and ingredients. A must try, but plan on around $160 per person without drinks for the Grand Tasting Menu, block out 3 hours and Let the Good Times Roll!, I enjoyed dinner at Tru last night. I had the spring tasting menu and my husband had the grand tasting menu. It was really lovely. Each course had lovely freshly prepared ingredients. The staff is very attentive and friendly. It's a very approachable fine dining experience. The desserts are always special here and there are so many of them!I was surprised to see foie gras on the menu, but now I understand that the ban isn't in effect yet. It was nice and I enjoyed it all the more since it may be the last time I have it at a restaurant in Chicago.I like this restaurant better than Trotter's. I think it's because the dining room is a more open space. I always like to people watch a bit at these sorts of restaurants. This is an expensive and decadent experience, but you only live once so treat yourself!, To go to Tru and give it anything other than 5 starts would be churlish. I went with my Wife last night, the food is exceptional, certainly as good if not better than Trotters. Without pontificating about the various courses I would just say go try it, but make it for a special occasion. The tasting menus are about as good as it get. The bill's not bad either, about $250 a head. If I were pressed my favourite restaurant would still be Everest, the view gets it for me. I would go back again and fully intend to. Chicago certainly has some fabulous places to wine and dine!!, This is by far my favorite upscale restaurant. I have been there about 5 times now and everytime is out of this world. It is very pricey especially if you get the wine pairings, but it is well worth the experience. I would highly recommend trying this place at least once. With the wine pairings and the chef's selection, you are looking at about $500 for two people. That is of course the biggest chef's station they offer, but if you are going to go that is the way to go for sure., I'm not even going to bother talking about the food here. It's obviously pretty amazing. I'm giving them five-stars for the adventure of trying to foil their impeccable service. By the time our food arrived, my companion and I had been seated, served and swaddled by no less than a dozen precisely coordinated dervishes. I'm a pretty low key dude, so all of this attention kind of freaked me out (in a good way, mind you; I mean no disservice to the incredible experience they provide). Of course, given that my bladder is the size of a morel-infused poached fava bean, I inevitably had to use the little pilgrim's room. I waited patiently until all of the visible members of the troupe appeared to be swirling around other patrons to make my break. I made it to within 3 steps from the restroom door when someone LEAPED OUT FROM BEHIND A CURTAIN to show me the rest of the way. Needless to say, it took me a couple of minutes to calm the notion that someone was going to leap out to assist me at the loo, too. That said (tongue-in-cheek, of course), the staff at Tru did an amazing job at removing the pretense and pressure typically associated with fine dining and injecting it with fun and flair, resulting in a fabulous experience neither my friend nor I will soon forget., Four plus hours of synchronized waitstaffing, water pouring, dish serving, restroom guiding, wine describing, and dessert indulging. My friend and I both had the chef's tasting menu, and it was fascinating to see the two different interpretations of the basic foundation of each course. The location was all about clean lines and contrasting blacks and whites. As a dessert afficionado, however, I feel I can't give the true (hardy har har) full five stars because the dessert, which was much feted, no longer included a separate chocolate selection. Sad. However, I must say that TRU offered a new and exciting handbag experience: each individual's purse gets its own little seat. Charming, non?, I wish I could give 3 1/2 stars, but I'll have to go with 3. Admittedly, I generally wasn't a happy camper while living in Chicago. Feel free to add a star to any of my Chicago reviews. Tru just didn't measure up to the standard set by French Laundry (or even Gary Danko). The service was impeccable, but the food didn't blow my mind and the dining area was too large. The bar area and entrance are perfect, but the actual dining room feels cavernous. I am a huge fan of clean, modern lines, but the far-too-high ceiling and lighting distracted me from the food and made me feel somewhat self-conscious. The tables are spaced far enough apart that conversations stay relatively private, but the spaciousness made me more aware of wait staff approaching the table than I would have liked. It was a fun birthday splurge, but I don't think I'll ever be back., Everyone should experience Tru at least once. I went with some friends a couple of years ago and it was incredible. It isn't dinner, it is a theatrical experience. The service is amazing, impeccably timed (every water glass was filled at the same moment, plates were placed in unison, etc). They even escorted me to the ladies room (which was beautiful). We were there 4 1/2 hours and could barely get up after! Not only do you get all the courses of the tasting menu, but they threw in a few amuse-bouches as well. The food was delicious and artfully presented.I am going to have to go back and try the new lounge menu, it sounds really good. I wish I could afford to dine at Tru more often!, An Fantastic dining experience! The lighting and black and white decor give Tru an art gallery feel and the food is the art! I took a tour of the kitchen and it's run to perfection. Clean and very quite. It was like watching a artist in his Studio. But more than anything, even better than the food, was the Service. Absolutely top notch. You have to be willing to sit and enjoy. The experience took a little over three hours. Slow eating can be very fun especially if you have the right person/persons to enjoy it with. Very expensive. Some might feel that no food is worth this expense, not this individual. Tru is one of Chicago's best., This was a truly incredible dining experience.Once I got over all the rich people who are used to be doted on, I was able to relax and take it all in.Someone mentioned the syncronization. Dear god, it was crazy.The food was absolutely out of this world.It was really nuts.I agree with many other fellow Yelpers - everyone should go to Tru once. You may leave in-debt if you chose to go the full 9, but what an experience.I'm still wow'ed three months later., I went about a year ago with my family and we all tried on of the gourmet dinners that about eight courses. The staircase caviar was amazing partly just because of the presentation. Every course was more amazing then the next and the five hours we spent there felt like nothing. The food blew me away. The most amazing course to me had to have been the cheese course. They came out with a cheese cart with what must have been 30 cheeses and then I got to choose which cheeses I wanted. After the dessert course be prepared for the mini desserts to come your way.If you are going to go there for dinner I would suggest doing the special menus. Since it's not a place you will go to a lot it pays to do the entire dinner. Beware you will constantly be asked to add thing to your set menu to add to the price. Tru also has several half bottles of wine which is a great way to do it because then you can have a half of white to share and then have some red with the meat courses. The wine can add to the experience but it also adds to the price.I think this is a great experience for everyone to have. It's not a place that you would go to a normal Friday night but for a special occasion I can't imagine eating at a nicer restaurant., Completely decadent! This is a great special occasion type restaurant. The food is inventive and fun. I couldn't get enough to the caviar staircase. Aside from being a great presentation, the caviar was just darn good. We had the Chef Tramonto's Market Collection which was amazing. I especially loved the soup served in the Limoge teacups. The dessert is obviously amazing since Gale Gand is a pastry genius. If money is no object, pair chilled vodka with the caviar and change up your wine with each course. There is a dessert tasting whoch I would love to try!, What can you say about Tru besides WOW? The only reason I could see anyone giving this place less than 5 stars is because it is very, very pricey. But everything else is simply impeccible. My date and I got a collection which included:- Raw Maine Diver Scallop, Kumamoto Oyster, Italian Black Pearl Osetra Caviar, Preserved Lemon- Roasted Langoustine, Hearts of Palm, Sunchokes & Brown Butter- Veloute of Summer Corn & Leek, Corn-Herb Fritters- Canadian Foie Gras Torchon, Salad of Rainier Cherries, Hazelnuts & Radish, Country Toast, Cherry Jus- Grilled Loup de Mer, Braised Baby Fennel, Tomato-Orange Nage- Roasted Elysian Fields Lamb, Salt-Poached Potatoes, Petite Summer Vegetables, Lamb Jus- Gale's Dessert Collection- Complimentary birthday chocolate snack- Mignardises & Lollipops- EspressoThe service is unbelievable. You are attended to like royalty. Even if you're not used to super-fine dining like this, the waitstaff will go out of their way to help you understand the food, the ettiquette, and anything else. They really are there for you from start to finish.The wine was outstanding as well, and there are some more reasonably priced selections if you're not a millionaire. But it certainly puts a pretty good hole in your pocketbook so be sure to save up for this treat.Seriously, the reviewers who gave 4 stars, I would hate to see what DOES impress you to a five star level., 'I made the mistake of trying Tru before Charlie Trotter. I did the kitchen table in both instances and the difference was AMAZING! I understand when you are in the kitchen table you are supposed to be getting the experience of being in the kitchen- I really do get that. At Tru, they actually treat you like some kind of royalty who are watching them prepare a feast. You are in a room surrounded by bowls of Japanese Fighting fish. You get a stool for your purse. They put a JUG(I mean JUG) of about 5 pounds of caviar on your table and tell you that you are welcome to eat as much as you would like, just make sure the waiter serves it to you. They serve you tiny ice cream cones with pea flavored ice cream. It was one of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. Unfortunately I then went to eat at Charlie Trotter where we were seated next to the dish washing machine. The experience was sub par compared to the dining extravaganza at Tru. Everyone should try Tru once, forget the competition.', 'Tasty. Luckily, I went on someone elses dime. My one complaint is the number of dessert courses they try to cram down your throat. As for the service-it impeccable. One of our servers said this as an aside: Must walk in counterclockwise circle or my head will explode.', I went to Tru with my husband to celebrate New Year's and we absolutely loved the experience. They strive....no...achieve perfection in every way. The waistaff were so attentive; the courses were delish. We ordered the collection with the 6 entrees and we also had cheese and chocolates - lots of chocolates...yummy! Our dinner was a little over 3 hours...so worth it!! We will definitely go back!, 'At Tru, you will find full of surprises! Until today, this is still by far the best restaurants that I have ever been to. It is expensive, but it definitely a very unique dining experience, and I would return if I ever visit Chicago again. The service was outstanding, it almost surreal. Restaurant itself is like a gallery, and food is the art. Everything is perfectly measured. The tasting menu is what you want to order, and don forget to order the melted chocolate cake with ice cream. It was too good to be TRUe! The day when I went, Nicolas Cage was there with his Korean gf (4 years ago)! I can say enough good things about this restaurant; you will have to experience it yourself. I highly recommend this restaurant for any special formal occasions.', 'Ah Tru. What more can I say about this Shrine to Cuisine? Dining at Tru is far from just eating dinner; it more like an adventure (especially for those brave enough to trust their palates and Amex bills to Mr. Tramanto and go for the spontanteous collection.) Ie tried about 100 courses at Tru and almost all of them were truly excellent, with none being less than very good. The decadent and beautiful Caviar Staircase is a fantastic way to begin your palate journey to Heaven, while the Tuna Tartare arnishedwith a beautiful live fish swimming in a small bowl under it is a breathtaking way to spend your time there, both visually and viscerally. Tru hits all the little touches to make dining their memorable. From a modern, elegant dining room filled with lovely art, to having the class to include bottled water with the price of the meals, and using fun Versace china, Laguiole steak knives, and having a dedicated staff member whose sole job is to polish their lovely stemware, servers that seem to truly love and revere the kitchen creations while they extol each course in detail, and sending you home with a sweet little Gift of Tru (note: temporarily being redesigned,) and sending Christmas cards signed by both the Chef de Cuisine and the Pastry chef to frequent diners, Tru does it all to perfection. My only regret is that the whole roasted lobe of foie gras prepared tableside is no longer available. Aldermen really need to reassess their priorities, eh? Tru is also a Wine Spectator Grand Award winner with the tome-like wine list to prove it. With such a vast selection, it understandable that they do not permit corkage, but their list is heavily weighted towards pricier bottles, which at a price of roughly 3 times retail, can get out of control quickly. Nevertheless, a savvy wine shopper can still find some good wines that won break the bank, especially in the half bottle area of the list.', 'I am going to mention the importance of making a reservation way way in advance for Tru. We called in Nov to get the reservation for end of Jan on a Saturday night and the best they had was 8:45 which is a touch on the late side for us. So, that being said--if you want a Saturday night @8pm, I would say call 4 months in advance to be safe. Our head waiter/captain was wonderful...His name is Israel. My husband and I each had a collection but it all needed to be modified as we are vegetarians who do not eat shellfish. The food was delicious. The sashimi course was great, the fish just about melted on our tongues. There was also a salmon course and a black cod- both were prepared beautifully and tasted excellent. There was a mushroom ravioli course that I did find a bit odd. It was essentially 2 mini crepes with some sauteed mushroom in between them. The taste was good but I wouldn call it ravioli. The two standouts of the evening for us were: the dessert cart and the cheese cart. Both are wheeled over to the table and the cheese selections were prepared tableside. Very charming. And, a great selection of cheeses. The dessert cart is adorable, complete with gourmet lollipops. I didn love anything that I ate from the dessert cart but it was cute! Then, they come around with truffles. The elvis is not to be missed- its banana and peanut butter!We also had a dessert off the menu that was pretty forgettable---we were very dissapointed in that. It was pumpkin something and average at best.The service is impeccable, they are extremely attentive and it is worth it to go and just get pampered. Their attention to detail is almost flawless, in that respect. We were given a banana cake (mini) when we left and it was DELCIOUS!We were surprised that the dining room was so bare/minimalistic/modern but it only causes you to focus on the food more so I do understand what theye doing... I would have liked to see a little more color though. If you are looking for a wonderful/expensive night out with inventive cuisine, I would suggest Alinea but if you aren quite that adventerous--- go to Tru! Enjoy.', '$50 cancellation fee PER PERSON!!I made a last-minute reservation at TRU for 9PM(table would have gone unused), changed my mind and when I called to cancel, they said they would charge $100 for the late cancellation!!!!I called back and talked to the manager and after debate, he cancelled my reservation without charge.I personally find this fee excessive, but appreciate their waiver. Here is their confirmation email from OpenTable, sounds like it was written by an English professor in the 19th century:Thank you for your reservation at TRU. Please be apprised of the following:1. Jackets are required for gentleman at all times in all areas of TRU. 2. There is no smoking in any area of TRU.3. We call to confirm all reservations. If no confirmation is received by thedate of the reservation we will have presumed that youE(tm)ve made other diningarrangements.4. Your dining experience will be two to three hours depending on your menu selection.5. Valet parking is available.6. With courtesy and respect to all guests please refrain from the use of cellphones or pagers within TRU.7. Dessert reservations can only be made by calling TRU.', 'I figured I hold off on the big 200 until Ie gone to somewhere exceptional. So for my gf extended birthday celebration, we ended up going to Tru. Tru really impressed me through and through. The service at this place takes dining to a whole new level and their attention to every minute detail never ceases to astound me. It all starts before you even step through their doors - the valet has a list of all the guests for the night. You are immediately greeted with by the host and who takes your coat and then proceeds to whisk you away to your table. Typically, the staff pulls the chair out for the lady - I found it refreshing that they pulled the table out for my lovely date.We then were greeted by our servers who provided our menus for the evening along with a very extensive wine list. It was a nice touch to have a custom printed menu for the birthday girl atop her menu. It took a while for us to decide what to get since literally everything on the menu sounded delicious, but we never felt rushed and our server was very helpful in suggesting items to sample. We decided to skip the marathon dinners (Black Truffle or Chef Collection) for a lighter fare so we ended up with the caviar staircase and prix fixe meals.For our amuse bouche, we got to sample some delicious melt in our mouth dumplings. The staircase featured four delicious and very fun to look at lumps of deliciousness. I started with their Hawaiian blue prawns accompanied by an aromatic curry sauce - to prepare me for that appetizer. My main course, butter poached Maine lobster, was cooked to absolute perfection and was greatly enhanced by its accompaniments. There was bisque to enhance to sweetness of the meat, a citrus and almond sauce to accentuate, and finally the most well prepared asparagus Ie ever had. I capped the dinner off with a beautifully made vanilla parfait with blood orange marmalade and chocolate ganache - it was picture perfect.It was amazing to see completely synchronized service - the removal and placement of our meal was perfectly timed on both sides of the table. In addition to our fare, we were further stuffed with samplings in between each course not to mention post-dessert desserts with things such as lollipops, truffles, caramel corn, variety chocolates. My date enjoyed a beautiful birthday brownie with a birthday message written in icing on the platter. Before heading out, they handed us the custom printed menu signed by all the chefs that helped make the night so memorable - talk about thoughtful!Tru really demonstrated why they are one of the best in world class dining. From the impeccable service to the sample fare pre/during/post dinner, everything was perfectly executed. On the way out the door, they handed us our coats and a complimentary banana bread. All I could think of at that point was Boy, wee stuffed!... Holy crap, post-dessert desserts and now banana bread? When are they going to stop feeding us? Tru is a great place to celebrate with that someone special. Go there and youe bound to get an experience to remember.', I went to TRU about 5 years ago for my birthday. I still think back fondly on that night as THE greatest dining experience I've ever had...and I've eaten at a lot of restaurants in Chicago and throughout the world. Bill was $300 per head (with tip), but it was completely worth it. They have trained their staff so that serving is an ART. The food is so imaginative, presented so beautifully, and so delicious. I still think about the caviar staircase, the most amazing soup I have ever had, and the phenomenal dessert. I think I've talked myself into splurging again at TRU very soon!, I haven't been here in years but still remember the stellar food, service, caviar staircase, whimsical desserts by Gale Gand, and the cute purse stools. One detail that I love most about Tru are the restrooms! The waterfall sink is enough to inspire jealously or a trip to Kohler, Wisconsin. Seriously. After all these years, I've made mental notes on how much or how little detail is put into a restaurant's bathroom. Tru is tops on my list., If one were to write a book on how a dining SHOULD be, they'd need the imagination of **** and the skill of **** to come anywhere near describing the experience offered by Tru., My family and I came here with a gift certificate. The service was SNOBBY and they seemed to turn our noses down at us, and we could overhear the servers whispering in worried tones that we would not tip well because we seemed to be wannabe clientele. Although the plates were artistic looking, they were no great shakes when eaten. Um, I'll go to the Art Institute of Chicago instead: thank you very much. One of the courses included a salmon dish that was bland-o-rino. Tru, my readers, is completely false!I seriously think this restaurant gets more credit for its social prestige (Could there be serious groupthink going on mistaking high price for high quality?) Exclusivity in setting soo does not mean excellence. My dears, who are you fooling?!? Compared to the great restaurants in New Orleans and Philadelphia, this wannabe, chic place falls flat on its face., 'Tru-ly amazing.Food: out of this world. We had a regular and a vegetarian menu so that we could have variety (why is it that these placestasting menus are usually the same?) , and left sated and stuffed. What truly dazzled me about this experience though was the service. Everything was done in tandem. Two waiters attended to everything. Each of our water glasses were refilled at the same time. Each of our courses were placed in front of us at the same time. Each of our drinks were placed in front of us at the same time. Etcetera. We felt like royalty. Don get me wrong, they charge royal prices but if you are up for a splurge, in my book it worth it.', 'You don go to Tru to go out to dinner. Eating at Tru is more like an event in-an-of itself, like going to an art show or the theatre. A museum of consumable food-as-art, where the chef is the artist, the server a tour-guide. Which is good ause it incredibly expensive. My husband and I went there for our 1 year anniversary. They had custom-printed menus wishing us a happy anniversary at the ready (impressive). I was 8 months pregnant at the time (so, sadly, no wine for me) and my husband doesn drink but the check for the both of us STILL exceeded $400! We chose the chef tasting menu in which we each received several courses (It supposed to be 7 but was really more like 9), each using the same base but interpreted differently for each of us. Chef was very careful of taking my condition into consideration and not serving me anything raw (drag for me...I love raw fish). It was a 4 hour gastronomic ballet of tastes, colors and textures. The minute we walked in we immediately noted the seeming somber calm of the place, how quiet it was and the lack of color and adornment to the decor. That in itself was, for some reason, intimidating. We fully expected the staff to be snobby but were pleasantly surprised that they were not, but very friendly, smiling, incredibly attentive and accomodating. As we were experiencing our meal it dawned on me why they chose the atmoshere they did: so that it would not compete, in any way, with the food! They created a comfortable but bland environment to enable all of your senses to focus on what was in front of you. pretty brilliant, I think. The timing of the courses was impeccable. We were never left with nothing in front of us for more than a minute or two.A visit to Tru is something you save for a very special occasion or to really impress someone. Don bother scheduling anything else around the experience...there no need.', 'Date: March 24, 2006Location: 676 North Saint ClairCorkage: not allowedCost: $550 - Market Collection Menu & Wine Pairing (includes t & t)Phone: 312.202.0001Had a 9:45pm reservation at TRU on the Friday I arrived in Chicago. As Crystal and I checked in, we were directed to the bar as the staff gets our table ready. We ordered two glasses of the 2004 K Vintners Viognier to start off the evening.About half way through the glass, we were informed the table is ready and offered a tour of the kitchen before sitting down. The kitchen tour wasn too interesting, just a standard quick walk-by.The dinner menu was presented to us, one side listing the pre-fixe menu with choices and the other listing the Collection options. Unfortunately the Seafood Collection wasn available, which was what I wanted to try, but we made do with the Market Collection for the both of us.A different approach to the wine pairing aspect, nothing listed, offered if asked and kind of go on a whim based on the $$ one wants to spend. Not exactly how I would of done if if I owned a restaurant, but that a different topic.The Market Collection is a nine course menu as listed below, course three through seven were prepared two ways with each of us having a different preparation of the same main ingredient.***Grand Amuse-Bouche~Scallop Ceviche, Avocado Puree, Lime Segments~Tuna, Marinated Trevio, OrangeItalian Black Pearl Osetra Caviar, Chilled Cauliflower Creme, Lemon Confit2002 Selbach-Oste Zetlinger Sonnenuhr Riesling KabinettNew Zealand Langoustine~Fresh New Zealand Langoustine, Thai Chili, Lemon Zest, Watercress~Roasted New Zealand Langoustine, Baby Carrots, Turnips, Fennel, Langoustine Jus2003 Hirsch Gruner Veltinger Kammener HeiligensteinDuck~Duck Bouillon, Duck Prosciutto~Veloute of Duck, Duck ConfitNV Rare Wine Company Charleston Sericial Madeira Special ReserveNova Scotia Halibut~Nova Scotia Halibut a la plancha, Sea Urchin, Preserved Lemon, Citrus Jus~Roasted Nova Scotia Halibut, Razor Clams Casino, Bacon, Clam & Spinache Sauce2003 William Fevre Chablis MontmainsPasta Course~House-made Farfalle, Chicken Wing Confit, Bayonne Ham & Foie Gras Glaze~Spaghettini, Carbonara Sauce, Parmesan Reggiano, Raw Amish EggNV Henri Billiot Rose BrutPrime Midwestern Beef Ribeye~Roasted Prime Midwestern Beef Ribeye, Braised Beef Short Rib, Glazed Pearl Onions, Crispy Bacon Lardons~Grilled Prime Midwestern Beef Rib Eye, Fondant Potatoes, Bearnaise Reduction2003 Yann Chave Crozes-Hermitage Tete de CuveeTRU Collection of Cow, Goat and SheepsMilk CheesesCherry Mint SoupDuet of Desserts1999 Chateau Pajzos Tokaji Aszu 5 PuttonyosMignardises and Lollipops***While the food was good overall and we got to try two different preparations, not one single dish gave me the wow factor. As usual, the final meat course failed me once again, although good to see it was ribeye rather than the standard filet mignon, but that about the only compliment I can give the course.The wine pairing choices were nice for the price they charged, but the word pairing should be crossed out as none of the wine paired well with the food. Not saying the pairing was awful, but definitely more thoughts could be put into the process.The service was attentive, prompt and precise, but WAY TOO mechanical and stuffy. Small talk with the Sommelier didn go anywhere, seem disinterested. None of the staff at the restaurant had a smile on them except for one person. Same type of service as French Laundry, but not what I would enojy as a dining experience.TRU is not a place I would return, just from the food standpoint, French Laundry, LaToque and Cyrus all out performs TRU. I can certainly name a few other places of different type of cuisine that out shine TRU as well, not a difficult task.Perhaps I am a bit spoiled and too critical, but a restaurant of this level should still show better.', I'm giving this review 4 stars but with with a major contingency. I would give it 5 stars if I could only rate the desserts, but I can't. My review is going to be kept simple. Skip the meal, go strait for dessert. 4 of us went to dinner & none of us were impressed with the meal. Across the board, it lacked originality & flavor that you expect as a restaurant such as this. However, when it came time for the dessert, it was a completely different story. Delicious, inventive & beautifully presented. I do believe that you can make reservations for dessert only...you'll have to double check., Tru is modern elegance personified. High ceilings, great art, inventive cuisine and an impeccable wine list all add to the experience that is Tru. The Sashimi appetizer was a table favorite, as were the scallops with avocado dumplings and the cheese selection---brought to your table on a cart and presented and explained by the resident cheese expert (though we thought at $20 a person the three cheese selection was over priced).With two sommeliers on the floor, all wine quandaries are easily answered and attended to. Overall, we can't say enough good things about the dining experience we had at Tru. The crowd was also surprisingly eclectic ranging from museum/artist types to captains of industry to stylish urbanites.**Diners that catch a chill at Tru are offered a Pashmina in the color of their choice out of a box that one might mistake for a cigar box. Pashminas are returned at the end of the meal., 'AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHThis is simply for having to plan an event here. Just don do it. I don know where you should go instead n Chicago. But it is not going well. My event is a week away and while not everything is Tru fault, they certainly are not making it easy.The biggest issue is that the Chef doesn want to have to prepare for having choices in private dining meals. So you have to give your guests 1 meal option.Here where that a problem for me.1. I NEVER pick restaurants when friends and I go out to eat cause I don want the responsibility.and2. I bad at picking my own meals (especially weeks or months in advance)So: therefore, I having problems. First I outsourced menu selection to the 2 members of my company staff actually eating the meal. Then the menu changed. So I made a logical change. Which meant that the entree was going to be beef.Well - the California mentality of my company says that that bad - people either a) need 2 choices or b) the one choice needs to be something safe like chicken.Welll there is no chicken. And the Chef won make options.And oh! the private dining contact is harder to find than Lindsay Lohan underwear. Ie worked with 8 different private dining contacts at similar restaurants in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, LA, San Francisco, Dallas and Minneapolis. All of them have been gracious and great helps as I plan these events. The contact at Tru has basically been unreachable and when she is reached, she completely unwilling to help me find solutionsSo where does that leave me? Sitting in Berkeley 1 week before the event losing my mind about what to feed 18 people that I don know.Maybe by next weekend it will all be smooth and nice - but for now...no. For now, I stressed and completely unimpressed.Edit: 4/28 - Plus 1 star. So I don know if they read my review but suddenly my contact is much easier to reach and much more willing to help. She helped me find what she and I thought was a great solution. Which my CEO then shot down. Soooooooooo - when I went back and said: we need 2 options and that that. She said: ok. And now it happening. Now there a matter of my event order being about $30 more/person than originally quoted...but wel talk about that on monday. The event is wednesday - expect an update.Edit: So we ended up cancelling the event (yeah, after all that work) because people waited till the day before to say they weren coming. Hello! RSVP by X date, means RSVP because I dropping mad money on you. Anyway - lost hella cash and went through the madness of the meal for no reason. I think this may be a good place for rehearsal dinners or small business meals or just a nice dinner out, but NOT for special events.', what else can i say that hasn't already been said?just go to tru...... simply superb., Without a doubt...FABULOUS! Not only was the food impeccable, but the service was exceptional. The several courses of dessert satisfied everyones sweet tooth! No detail is overlooked. If you haven't been...run, don't walk!, We sat at the kitchen table. This itself was an experience of a lifetime. Not only did we have our own private table from which we could overlook the kitchen, but we had the most amazing service I've ever experienced. It felt that everyone was basically told to take care of us no matter what. In fact, at a couple of points even the sommelier poured our water for us. On that note, Chad, the sommelier, was fabulous. He did a really great job helping me, a Napa oaked rich wine loving girl, find a lighter wine to better go with the food. Very impressed. And, there were even some affordable bottles of wine on the list. They ranged from $45 to 6,000 (no typos), and the decent selection of wines by the glass allowed me to try more while not spending way too much.The food was pretty good. The only bad thing about the kitchen table is that you don't choose your menu. This means we were exposed to things we probably never would have tried on our own. This is good and bad. I thought the food was just okay (BEAUTIFUL, but not always my taste), but I really enjoyed trying everything and I absolutely feel that I would think it was better had I ordered my own choices.Toward the end of our evening, I needed to use the restroom. When I asked where it was, a server actually took me there and waited until I came out to escort me back. Incredible. We also then received a full kitchen tour, and a tour of each piece of artwork in the restaurant.Very impressed. Will give it 5 stars when I stop regretting the outrageous amount we paid for food we wouldn't have chosen on our own., I haven't been here in 2 or 3 years or so but can still remember every little detail (though, conveniently, if I forget they provide you with a take home menu of everything you ate and drank). The best meal I've ever had in my life.We reserved a spot in the upstairs semi-private dining area, a great alternative to the downstairs dining if you can get a spot up there. It's just you and 3 other tables upstairs, it's very very nice. Service was stellar--I can't imagine anything being better. (I think the service was measurably better than other local competitors--Alinea, et al.). The wine service was personal and they had a lot of good selections by the glass or bottle. We opted to go by the glass, and the sommelier helped us pick out wine throughout the dinner. I much preferred ala carte selection of wine by the glass over just having them pair wines. They still ended up choosing much of what we drank, but we were involved and had a say so it wasn't like they were just bringing us bottles and we were drinking whatever they brought. The food itself was outstanding. Everything was perfectly prepared and presented well.... Dessert is fantastic, too. We both had the full chef's collection tasting menu, and even though we both ordered the same thing we got different courses throughout the night... So that was a great advantage as well.Sure, the place is a huge splurge and you could fly to Europe in the off season for almost the same price per person, but this will be equally as memorable 5 years down the line., 'Same review as all the other positive ones. If youe going to drop 6 bills on dinner, this is the place to do it and not regret a single dime (or $200 bottle of wine). I love that on your way out, they give you coffee cake for the morning after. I halfway expected our waiter to show up with a cup of coffee at 8 a.m. the next day.One thing, though, Chicago men: this is formal dining. Jacket required generally also means don wear a polo shirt under your blue polyester jacket. Put on a tie, dudes. Sheesh.', If you want a Tru(e), top of the line dining experience...The best dining experience I have ever had. But with that said...I don't think I will ever need to go back. If I could give 4.5 stars I would. Let me start by saying that I am not a fancy dinner guy...I would prefer a steak over caviar on a cracker. However, I went to Tru with a totally open mind ready to try everything that they offered. My wife and I went on a Thursday evening, late at 9pm, and we left a little after midnight. We never ever felt rushed, I actually found the pace of the meal very enjoyable. Every single person on staff was providing the best possible service, though I think they could do better with where they store the clean wine glasses, they were constantly restocking a shelf with glasses right near our table. My wife had the Spring Collection and I had the Chef's Market Collection, and overall both were excellent. Each course offered showed GREAT attention to detail and presentation. Each dish had delicate mix of flavors, most of which I had never tasted. High points for us were:-Roasted White Asparagus, Shallots, Parmesan-Rabbit Consomm, Morels, Pea & Lavender Emulsion-Artichoke Emulsion, Trout Roe, Condensed Mint, Dende OilAs an un-experienced diner, I felt that each dish held a rather small portion, though I know that the taste and the presentation are just as important. (A piece of veal the size of a silver dollar is a little on the small side...I think a second piece could be spared.) However, after progressing through to the cheese course, you begin to become full. Then they hit you with a selection from over 15 different offerings of cow/goat/sheep's milk cheese, with widely different tastes. The cheese fills in the gaps in your stomach left by the smaller portions. THEN then hit you with desert, which is just as excellent as any of the dinner courses. And if you couldn't take any more, they bring out some small chocolates and some desert bread to fill in the open space on your plate. Now I can say that I have experienced the top of the line this city has to offer...but would I go back? Probably not, or at least not for a few years. It is just not my thing, and it is fairly cost prohibitive. When I go out for a nice dinner, I think around $100-$150 max for the two of us...and Tru is definitely far above that range. But more than the price, the style is just...too...fancy for me. Each dish is a work of art by itself and I think I would rather look at a pretty picture than stir it up and eat it in one or two bites., Saving the big 300 for an exceptional dining experience. All restaurants should have service of this level. Five stars all the way for TRU. Service, ambiance, food quality and aesthetics - every aspect of our experience was magnificent. Upon walking in, we were immediately shown to our table (we were seated in an intimate corner of the restaurant) and two servers lifted and moved the table so I could be seated and get comfortable. Yes, all of the other tables had stools for pocketbooks (very thoughtful), but I didn't need one as I was sitting on one of their benches. The ambiance is perfect. Clean lines, contemporary, luxurious and modern, but with a bit of traditionalism. Tables are spaced perfectly so we could share an intimate dinner. BF had called ahead and had them personalize our menu for our celebration (we later took home the menu and they printed out a separate menu for us with all the dishes we had). It was truly special.Immediately we were served a buffalo mozzarella palette cleanser, a great way to start the evening. We decide to go with the Chef's collection as it was more in line with our palettes. 16-courses of delight. My personal favorites were: Selection of Sashimi Grade Fish, Complementary GarnishesRabbit Consomm, Morels, Pea & Lavender EmulsionWhipped Salt Cod, Creamy Potato, Smoked Gele, CaviarTagliolini, Peeky Toe Crab, UniPoached American Red Snapper, Green Papaya, Fennel, Thai NageChocolate Hazelnut Mousse, Orange Sherbet, Cardamom Scented Oranges - This may be the best chocolate dessert I've ever experienced.Fresh ingredients, incredible flavor profiles, perfect amount of innovation and a great balance of light and heavier courses. They brought out a special dessert to celebrate our occasion, which was a fantastic little chocolate cake. Just when we thought we were done, they came by with a plate of truffles... and then the cart of pastries and candies. We were so full, we asked if we could have a doggie bag. Sure enough, they brought out two boxes and sent us home with a great assortment of chocolate and candies. I cannot say enough about the service we received. Approximately 5-7 people served our table, perfectly synchronized from clearing our plates, filling our wine and water to describing each dish to perfection. Staff was very courteous, delightfully charming and always smiling. On our way out, they gave us two loaves of iced lemon pound cake for breakfast!48 hours later, and I'm still thinking about our experience at TRU..., 'TRU.....an experience it was. Food was great, no arguments there. Service was interesting if a bit annoying. Following me to the bathroom was a bit odd and then sneaking up on me when I got back to slide my chair in was a bit much. The wine list was absolutely amazing and we took full advantage of it.The only reason I am giving this 3 stars is b/c I almost feel as if TRU is trying to hard. It was almost clinical and the patrons were on pins and needles b/c the atmosphere was so cold. It was like nobody wanted to make a mistake or something and everyone was on their tiptoes. Just a wierd vibe. For those wondering about price, We had 4 people, a drink before, a bottle of wine, and dessert and it was $1000, so prepare to spend some moola.', 'Why only 4 stars? TRU is a delightful indulgence in many, many respects: impeccable and gracious service, playful and intriguing menu, all amidst comfortable and modern surroundings. I give it only four stars because, while it was the most expensive meal Ie had the pleasure of eating ($900 for two people), it was not the best meal. I went expecting ambrosial bliss, but came away noting it _only_ as a very pleasant meal and fantastic experience.My husband and I each ordered the Chef Market Collection and accompanying wine pairings, as well as the near-famous caviar staircase. In the end we were served 12 courses, plus amuse bouche and other little bites. It was truly a night of food!There were two courses that very nearly sent me into the foodie heaven I was hungering for: the roasted asparagus with shallots and parmesan; and the braised veal shank with sweetbread cappelli, carrots and veal bouillon. Both dishes were prepared with delightful layers of tongue dancing flavor that sent my head spinning. Oh, and I mustn forget the dessert! An awe-inspiring accomplishment composed of chocolate hazelnut mousse, orange sherbet, and cardamom-scented oranges. Wow!Additionally I should note the buffalo mozzarella dumpling with green olive emulsion & black olive powder, served as an amuse bouche -- quite enchanting. As was the cheese course (the four cheeses I selected have disappeared from memory, quite upsetting). The wine pairing with each course was also delightful as an accompaniment (of which I was grateful), but perhaps not awe-inspiring in their own right.The much talked about caviar staircase was a bit of a disappointment, however. Perhaps it is my own fault -- while I am quite fond of caviar, I found the sturgeon caviar lacking a bit in texture and pop. The slightly blander nature of this type of caviar truly needed the accompaniments of creme fraiche, red onions, and capers that were served. But what was lost in actual flavor was in part made up for in the overtly decadent presentation.The disappointments of the evening meal came in the form of an over-abundance of foams and gelees. Every dish, it seemed, was steeped in this trendy food preparation, and as the evening wore on it became rather boring. The foam less so -- every preparation was at least ripe with exciting flavor. But the gelee turned ugly with the course of whipped salt cod and creamy potato -- a foul taste and texture approximating fishy jello as though whipped in the Bass-o-matic of SNL legend. One dish I wish I had sent back.Overall, however, the experience was quite positive. I imagine I will be back. And I will remember to order the wine pairings with each course, and to pass on the caviar. (And if at all possible, avoid the gelee!).', I went to Tru for a work dinner and the food and experience was definitely very creative and exceptional. We got the chance to take a tour of the kitchen, which was really interesting. Apparently, the chef designed the kitchen and used polished granite slabs from the building that preceded Tru as counter tops.The food was very well thought out and created as every dish had several tastes that complemented each other really well. We had Halibut and Smoked Tenderloin. I really loved the Halibut and I'm not really that big on fish. After the dinner and formal dessert, they brought out little candies, including hand made tiny lollipops. At first I thought that wasn't very exciting. But they were so cute, I gave them a try. They were banana and Anise seed and actually changed the taste of the after dinner wine. I thought that was really clever.I really appreciated being taken here, not only because it was a nice experience, but I probably won't be able to spend that much on a dinner myself., 'Tru was a wonderful experience. Beautiful space, elegant wait staff. Love the napkin choice - I hate using a white napkin when wearing black slacks. Also thought it was very interesting that they offer a tiny little table for your purse! Nice touches.We opted for the Spring tasting menu. 8 or 9 courses and added a course of sunchoke at the beginning. The sommelier was very knowledgable, but informed us that he was having a difficult time with the chef selections and the prevelance of spring vegetables (asparagus, artichoke, sunchoke) that are notoriously difficult to pair. Awesome, thanks for letting us know that the wine might not work?? Wee paying an arm and a leg for dinner, the least you can do is lie to me and tell me it all going to be fabulous.Dinner progression was nice, albeit almost entirely protein-free. A dish that had mentioned lamb was actually a lamb broth. A dish that mentioned a cheese was actually a cheese foam. I was having one of those where the bread guy moments - not just b/c I wasn filling up, but b/c it hard to drink 8 glasses of wine on an empty stomach and still maintain the kind of decorum required for an evening at Tru.Dessert and cheese were my favorite parts. Although it was probably not the case, I did pretend that Gayle Gand was making the dessert personally for me.All in all - a beautiful evening, but I would definitely recommend Nomades or Alinea over Tru if youe looking to spend that type of money.', '*4.5 stars*I blame TRU for my gaining 5 lbs during my trip to Chicago... OK, to be fair, it probably wasn all of TRU fault... But those damn good desserts probably did some of the damage!I had the scallops to start and the orange marlin for my main. The husband started with the smoked salmon and had the suckling pig for his main. Everything was delicious and well prepared, especially husband suckling pig. I should have ordered that! YUM!For dessert (YEA FOR DESSERT!!!!!!!!!!), oh what the hell?! Let go for the dessert tasting! WOW! So glad that we did. It was basically five tastings; 1) fruity palate cleanser shot, 2) fruit, 3) chocolate, 4) root beer float, and 5) candies off the candy cart. Different tastings for the both of us for the fruit and the chocolate dishes. Some of the items we had: the vanilla cream (my favorite of all and I a chocolate lover), sticky pudding, chocolate semifreddo (also YUM!), bittersweet chocolate mousse. Everything really was delicious. So happy that we came to TRU. Quite the class act. We even got a yummy parting gift (lemon pound cake) and a ride back to our hotel in the restaurant car. Thank you, TRU for a great dining experience!', 'I would give 6 stars if I could. It was not a dining but rather an experience. Not another typical upscale restuarant. Be sure to try if you get a chance.', Early in our meal our attendant asked us where else (in Chicago) we had been. We told him where we had been, what we liked, what we didn't, etc, etc... Of course he asked us what had been our favorite up to that point and we told him Charlie Trotter's. He made the expected comment hoping to change that. I have to say they didn't start strong. But to be fair, they didn't start weak, it's just that we had seen most of their early tricks:Cucumber Mint Juice - seemed like almost every restaurant in Chicago was doing this one;Vermont butter with lots 'O fat - both my wife and I thought immediately of the French Laundry;Sweet Potato Sorbet as an Amuse - reminded me of the Salmon cone at the French Laundry because of the way it was served;Watermelon w/ Balsamic and The Caviar Staircase - I own the Amuse Bouche book that Tramonto wrote, so these were not a surprise;Fighting Fish Bowl - again expected because I'm an information whore and I had scoured the net for pics and reviews before we went.Don't get me wrong, those were great, the Caviar Staircase in particular. I just wasn't wowed, so it wasn't pushing through that barrier to be crowned the Best of Chicago in our minds. That was until...I'm not sure if it was the Souffles or the Homemade Rootbeer Float - which ever one I tried first - the other was just confirmation of that decision. It's hard to describe just how good their desserts are and how deserving Gale Gand is of the praise she receives. I was disappointed that the Bread Pudding wasn't a little more dense and custardy-french-toast like, which is what I'm used to, but everything else was pretty amazing. The cart of Petit Fours and Chocolate just pushed everything else to an almost bliss state. We just couldn't stop smiling.Other highlights of the meal include the Espresso-Roasted Quail, Watermelon-Mint Shooters, the Cheese Cart and the Caviar Staircase which I mentioned before (especially the Wasabi infused Tobiko). What's really neat is the fact that they have about 140 dishes in their arsenal, so you could easily go back several times and never have the same dish twice. Maybe even coming up with your own ultimate menu after you've been there a dozen times!Read the whole review at Gastronomic Fight Club:gastronomicfightclub.com43_, This is sad, I ate here about six months ago and cannot remember a thing; nothing great, nothing was terribly bad. Tru will just fall into the land of unmemorable meals and I really do not see a reason to go back.I was really hoping to have an experience like at Masa's in SF or the French Laundry, which were both great meals. The only real thing I remember are the two pastries that were given to me on the way out the door :(, 'This restaurant does not deserve the good reviews it is given in Zagat. The atmosphere is cold to the point of being almost sterile, the service is haughty and the food is only so-so. It does not compare with Nomi, Trotters, Les Nomades, Spring or even North Pond. Seriously, we have been there for dinner three times - only once by choice - and it is totally not worth its 28 food, 27 decor, or 28 service rating by Zagat. Do not waste your time or money.', 'Ha! Youe kidding, right? Never had a better meal in six years Ie lived in the city of Chicago. Pricey? Yeah. A little snobby? Sure. Will you see at least one guy being accompanied by a professional date? Probably. All that makes for good food and good fun.Been there more than ten times, and it never disappointed me.', Service was Awesome! Synchronized water refills! 4-5 waiters for just our table! The dessert and the Madeleine Cookies to go were the best. The prixe-fix food itself was visually incredible, but so-so on the palette. She was impressed, however, I wouldn't go again unless they improved the menu., 'Ever heard of the pity pound cake (hereforth known as the PPC)? Well, that is what we got when my friend and I tried to go and eat there tonight... My friend and I were dressed in business attire, just having left our clinic after a long day. We just wanted to enjoy some good food and drink and were prepared to pay for just that...Enter the hoity-toity host - I guess he took one look at us and decided that we were not worthy - and how did we know? Could it be the look of disdain when we walked in? The way he talked over the other (nice) hostess who would have let us eat but he said no? The way that he even prevented her from letting us eat in the lounge (Il have to check with the kitchen! - as a note, they DO serve the lounge, unless, I guess, if they think you are unworthy.) And this is where the PPC comes into play - at this point, I was actually still willing to consider giving this establishment a try... but then he was like, wait, here, you can have this - along with our card so that you can TRY to make a reservation. It was a mini pound cake with their business card attached to it.I could have spent hundreds of dollars there (and even more in the future). But apparently, he has some better ideas of who he wants to let in his door. That too bad, some other establisment will just get to enjoy the $$$$ that I would have spent at this restaurant. Oh, and the PPC wasn even that good (it made my friend choke).', Probably the best meal I've ever had...I went to TRU tonight for a business meal with one other person. I was immediately impressed by the kind hostess and the non-pretentiousness of the place (ok, it's a little pretentious, but you're paying for that) - people weren't snotty at all.We were greeted right away with exceptional service (including a chair for my handbag - no really, they brought a stool to our table just for my purse so that it wasn't on the floor) including an escort to the ladies room. He didn't go in, just walked me there.We ate off of the Fixed Price menu and were extremely pleased. My colleague had the Halibut and I had the Ribeye as our main courses - I tasted hers and both were absolutely delicious.We received a pallet cleanser between each course and each was better than the one before. Top off this wonderful dinner with a cheese plate and some amazing desserts. The chocolate mousse was rich and creamy. I thought we were done and then they brought the lollipops and truffles. Oh my word. Overall and wonderful experience complete with a lemon pound cake to take home for breakfast. I was very pleased with my meal and the service and would go back again without hesitation. You should go here expecting your meal to take about 3 hours, but it is time well spent., The food is great here but what really stands out is the service and the decor. When you're eating in Tru you eating in the presence of Warhols and other great pieces of art. The service here is excellent. The best I've ever seen in my life. When I ate here at the end of our dinner they gave us little cakes to take home and eat for breakfast. I was so impressed by that gesture., We came here for my dad's birthday dinner on 9/4 and I can definitely say that this was the most incredible meal I've ever had. The service was impeccable and they manage to create an atmosphere where you can have a fine dining experience while still feeling very comfortable and not at all uptight or pretentions, as fine dining restaurants sometimes can feel. Make sure you opt for a cheese course - it was one of the highlights of our meal. I loved the little pound cake they send you home with!, It's been awhile, but Tru was far and away* the best dining experience of my lifetime. Food and service both. From the understated unpretentious service, to the cheese flight (*drool*), to the original Warhol looking down on us, to the candy cart after dessert, to the personalized takeaway menu at the end - all of it simply stunning. Saving my pennies to do it again sometime soon!*This reminded me of that terrible early 90s Tom Cruise/Nicole Kidman epic disaster of a film. Made me chuckle., 'excellent ambience and service...the choreographed waitstaff is something to see... that alone gets an extra star :) The food.. was good, but not great. The appetizer I had I wasn a big fan of (jalepeno, avocado, apple, something) - it sounded like it would be good, but wasn (presentation was nice, though). The entree was quite tasty , but you can really go wrong with salmon. And the sticky toffee pudding dessert was DELICIOUS! (I know it sounds scary, but it wasn at all.. it was really good).Overall, great atmosphere, but just good food. The 4 stars rating is not so much for the food (food would only get 3 stars), but mainly because Tru is far and away one of the best service/atmospheres youl experience', Had a very good, but not superior, experience here. The food was excellent, aside from the souffle that never appeared. That is why it gets 4, instead of 5 stars. When one is spending over $1,000 for 3, the service should be perfect. And while it was very very good, we ordered the souffle for dessert while ordering dinner. When it was time to be served after a 2 plus hour dinner, we were told it would be another 30 minutes. Now, I am fairly well traveled and have dined everywhere from Alinea, Daniels in NY, Gary Danko's in SF, etc.. and the one thing they had in common, was impeccable timing. Tru disappointed on this throughout the night. It seemed as though we were never a priority. It was a Wednesday night, but last I checked, the prices are the same as a weekend.The food, however, was phenomenal. Not a single complaint there. And perhaps they have one of the finest cheese courses in the country. I only wish we had the wait experience that matched the dining experience........|1
0|aska-brooklyn|Excellently prepared meal with unique flavors.We stopped by with a reservation on a Friday evening, and it was pretty quiet meal given that I think it was still its first week and there was definitely space for more tables. There are too many dishes to recount in detail, but all of the ingredients were extremely fresh (although a bit lacking in protein). Among the more memorable dishes included the Maine shrimp, the king crab, the squid tart, and the dry aged rib eye; the latter in particular was an amazingly tender and flavorful piece of meat. We also split a wine pairing between my friend and I, and they poured it into two glasses for us so that we could share both, which I greatly appreciated.Overall, its a pricey but excellent place for a quiet, refined, not very heavy meal with excellent flavors., Never been to the original Aska, which received numerous accolades from prominent food critics and a Michelin star.Executive Chef Fredrik Berselius just opened up his Nordic restaurant in another location right across Williamsburg Bridge. You can just walk across the bridge, and the restaurant is right there.Left very, very impressed; Overall, wonderful tasting menu (18-courses) from beginning to end.Highlights: All (Not going into details; Very creative & delicious, some using unique techniques & preparation).You just have to come & try it yourself. = Culinary geniusExcellent wine pairing (& reasonably priced).Impeccable service. Wonderful/very friendly staff.Chef Berselius came by the table often.Big thumbs up for playing some great tunes from The Smiths (Arghhh.......Im so old.). Gratuity included. No tipping here.Highest recommendation.: 10 calendarsNote: They also have a casual outdoor dining area (with separate, inexpensive, but limited a la carte menu) - no reservations required for that one - and a bar downstairs., Ahhh... Aska is back! The original Aska, a small space in the back of Kinfolk Studios, was on our top 3 tasting menus in New York City. We were greatly saddened when it closed in 2014, but have been waiting patiently for chef Fredrik Berseliuss reopening. We dined at Aska opening week, and the menu did not disappoint! Fortunately for us, opening week also fell on our 7-year anniversary, so we made it an occasion. The restaurant is right by the Williamsburg Bridge with quite an unassuming storefront; use to be an old warehouse. When we checked in with the hostess, we were led downstairs to a cellar bar and poured a glass of champagne in celebration of our anniversary. It was a lovely gesture. While we enjoyed a toast, we noticed that the bar serves a more casual a la carte menu as well as wine, beer, and cocktails. As far as Im aware, they dont take reservations for the bar (or garden); its first come first served.We were then led back upstairs to the main dining room. Gorgeous space. It was dark and moody, but spacious and intimate with an open kitchen. We didnt do a pairing with our tasting menu, but we ordered 2 cocktails each throughout our dining, which were as superb as you would imagine. The tasting menu consisted of 19 courses, each dish was beautifully curated--visually and taste-wise. Each ingredient is deliberate, and Chef Berselius has foraged some (most?) of it himself. An innovative culinary journey. To give a sense of the menu, I will bore you with the details of some of the highlights: CAVIAR: grilled onion, sustainable finish caviar from Carelian, cultured cream, lemon verbenaRAZOR CLAM: razor claim, peas, elderflower and while pea oilBLOOD PANCAKE: blood pancake, cherry, rose and rosehipSKATE: cured skate wing, celery root puree with its leaves, roasted celery root, unfiltered rapeseed oil and flowering dillSQUID TART: tart made with seaweed, charred squid and a puree made from dulseBEEF: 50 day dry aged rib eye, preserved black currant and salted plum from last year, cured beef fatAnd there were 3 delicious, fresh desserts! The entire experience was about 3 hours. Service was orderly and flawless. The tasting menu is completely and thoroughly worth it. It came as a surprise that at the end of the meal, we learned that tax and gratuity were already included in the price. Outstanding meal and evening! Aska remains one of my top favorite tasting menus in NYC, and Im excited and appreciate that there is an a la carte dining option now. I hope to be back again soon!, What a great experience at this newly opened Williamsburg restaurant. The chef is a genius. The food was outstanding. The restaurant space is great. We were brought downstairs for a drink in the lounge before being shown to our table. They have a nice garden space too. The tables themselves are beautiful wood. The kitchen is open so you can see the master at work. I love the new Nordic/Scandinavian cuisine, after a trip to Scandinavia last year. The forward thinking and pushing the boundaries of innovation continually amazes me. We had a 20 course culinary journey. I think I didnt care for one dish. Beyond that they were all very good to fantastic. The plating was stunning. The highlights for me were the langoustine, the oysters, the liken with mushroom, and the strawberry dessert. The chef is a humble and kind guy who spent time talking to us during dinner and afterward. The staff was all very friendly and informative. Obviously full after 20 courses but not stuffed. My friends may disagree. I just had a great time. Not an every day restaurant. But definitely worth the splurge. They also have a bar menu in the garden and lounge that doesnt require a reservation. Cant wait to go back. And oh, theres a cool parting gift., The chefs delivered an icredible dining experience bolstered by an excellent team of waiters/hosts. I didnt particularly enjoy every single dish (2 I didnt like) however every individual course was truly unique, regardless of my satisfaction. Can go into extreme detail for each course but that would be corny as hell. True to every dish were the various layers of flavors, even in a single bite. Some dont even hit till you begin your second bite, then you go hey... Waitstaff was incredibly attentive and friendly, was trying to think about something to write and just realized I dont even remember them clearing out the plates and cutlery between each course. Do remember the setting of cutlery and the presentation of each course, very theatrical, however the transition between each act, very ninja-esque.Dinner is pre-paid when you make a reservation, so there is an added bonus of feeling like the meal was free. Btw totally worth the price if you dont feel the freebie-ness of it.Lastly, dont plan anything too close to your reservation time, dinner took us a little over 4 hours. A quick 4, not the draggy kinda 4|0
1|bouley-new-york|By far one of my best dining experiences ever! Bouley was not only pleasant to look at, but the food was amazing. Fresh breads wheeled right up to your table, 7 or 8 different kinds, great choice of wines, the appetisers were light and decadent, followed by main courses to make your heart melt. My father and i went together, and tried as much as we could on the menu. Nothing was a disappointment, everything was delightful. Now if i had been paying i probably wouldnt have had so much, but since daddy picked up the tab we went all out. A must try! Michael Bouley is truly an amazing chef!, Have been several times and again the other night. Everything we ordered was sublime! Oysters, foie gras, black sea bass in bouillabaise, the lamb... Service friendly, professional, non-stuffy. Room beautiful -- we love the strikingness and intimacy of the red room. Will be back many more times!, A family favorite - every time my parents come to visit we have to eat here at some point during their trip - The food is consistently good - the service is always great - and the ambiance is so comforting. We always get the tasting menu, which doesnt change as frequently as Id like, but thankfully i love all their dishes so i havent really been able to complain. Their breads are fresh and good - i always end up getting one of everything - and their strawberry cloud with rose petals dessert is delicious. I also love the lemon loaf they give you at the end when you leave. Always a favorite - David Bouley at his best!, I wish I could give half stars ere because this classic mainstay from downtown deserves three and a half, not four. They are spot on with thier food, its exactly what you would expect from a master chef. However, the captain and sommolier were bickering at the table as to wether or not to leave the carafe. Nonetheless it was entertaining but interfered with the feeling of clean service. Nothing quite like watching a gay man and a french man argue over wine edicit in whispering voices. I mention it, because the food, although good, and perfectly fine, was simply what you would expect. Nothing, and I do mean nothing more. It felt like everything was rote, and almost ingenuine at points because it felt like all of them had been around the block a few too many times. But I do admit the tasting menu was absolutely slamming., This place must rate as having the best weekend brunch anywhere! From the moment you step inside (and smell the fragrance of fresh fruit surrounding you) and are immediately greeted and seated, you know you are in for a grand experience. And Bouley does not disappoint. The decor, the service, the food...all sublime. Not cheap, but worth the price of admission., Sure, this place may no longer be considered the best restaurant in the city, but it still without a doubt among the best. I will warn you that I am slightly biased towards this place because first of all, it served me the best meal that I have ever eaten in my life up until this point (although I am sure that it will be topped relatively soon), and also because this is the place that proved to me that fine dining really is something special. Up until eating here I was merely a fan of fine dining, but never got to truly experience it... I read about it, I learned about it, I even went to school to be one of the people creating it, but there was always a part of me that was unsure whether or not it could really satisfy me more than an extra indulgent trip to Chinatown could. This was the place that proved to me that fine dining really does have the potential to be everything that I dreamed it is... that gastro-orgasms can be stretched out over the course of 2 or 3 hours without one second of lowering from heaven until it comes time to leave, and even then a feeling of satisfaction seems to linger with you on your way out the door.My parents birthdays are only a few days apart, and to celebrate both of them, we had headed to the city, planning to eat at Landmarc. The wait at Landmarc was about an hour so we left our number and took a walk down the street and got some coffee at the cafe owned by Bouley across the street. Then we walked across the street to Bouley just to take a peek at the menu. My mother then asked, You want to eat here? to which I replied it the weekend and we don have a reservation, besides, look how I dressed (I was wearing an over-sized white tee shirt). She then said It doesn hurt to try and disappeared into the door, only to come back out and wave for me to come in. Once I entered, I was treated like royalty, even if I was far from dressed like it.We sat down near the bar briefly before we were seated. We then all ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairing, and since most of the courses had three choices, we each got different ones, except for the second course which only had two choices so we got two of one and one of the other... and we each tasted some of each others dishes and wines, although we mainly stuck to our own. There was not a dull moment during the whole meal, and even though we did not have a reservation, the only waiting that ever occurred was the few minutes we waited to be seated, which wouldn of even been waiting if we had ordered a drink. I not going to bother evaluating every dish we had because there were a lot and they were all perfect. So were the 8 different types of bread offered to us between just about every course, and so were all the wines. When the desserts came (well the second course of desserts, because there were two), there were two choices for the course and instead of giving two of us one of the desserts and one of us the other, they all gave us the same one (a valrhona molten chocolate cake with three ice creams, the best molten chocolate cake Ie ever had so far, and Ie had a few) and gave us one of the other to share, compliments of the chef. As the meal came to an end, I was filled with a mixture of extreme satisfaction as well as sadness that it had to come to an end. From that moment forward, I look forward to the special occasions which will call for me to indulge in meals of this caliber probably just as much as I look forward to anything of great importance in life., this place is amazing. from the apple cart lined walkway to the elegant rustic cozy feel of the interior, everything was perfect. we had the lunch, which, for 50 dollars is an incredible steal. everything i ate was perfect and the breads were all delicious. the service was amazing. they even gave us each a bag full of baked goods from their bakery across the street. everything was amazing., had a stellar dinner with exceptional service this week. the setting is elegant with vaulted cielings and a deep red color. they took very good care of us, and there were complimentary items from the chef to start and end the meal, which is always a plus. as a starter, the new york state foie gras was to die for, with an enormous portion, even for two people. i had the baby pig as my entree, which was nice, but not exciting. my companion had the lobster with the fricassee, which she absolutely loved. really not much to say except it was an excellent meal and i hope to go back.i was pretty sauced by the time i left, and i thought it would be endlessly amusing to juggle some apples in the entry hall. my coordination was a little off, and the staff was not as amused as i :)., I absolutely love this restaurant! I loved everything about it- the ambience, the food, the service- it was all amazing. I ordered the tasting menu and the food was delicious. My main course was a duck breast that was absolute perfection. I loved the different varieties of breads that they had to offer as well- I almost filled myself up on bread alone! (I also loved the cart that they rolled around to serve the breads) Our server was beyond attentive and I couldnt find a flaw in the entire night. I highly recommend this restaurant for special occasions- its top of the line all the way., Everything was AMAZING from the decor, to the food, to the service but they should really warn you about the small portions. I was surprised to see that the appetizer and main entree were about the same size. Im sure that even with the small portions they have never seen two females eat so much.We ordered one tasting menu and an extra entree plus three desserts. For the starters, phyllo crusted FL shrimp, squid, and sea scallop then return from Chang Mai. These two really were phenomenal in taste and presentation. The part that I was a little disappointed in was my lamb entree. I had expected to have at least half a rack, instead I ended up with two pieces of meat that were very small. Thank goodness they had potato puree = mashed potatoes which helped to fill me up. Regardless, both the lamb and squab were amazing in taste. For dessert, chocolate souffle, rice pudding, and pineapple meringue. The chocolate souffle was the best I have ever had. Another thing that was great was a beet sorbet with some type of cheese that we had to start. Im not a big fan of beets but this item was very tasty!Overall I really enjoyed my experience. I felt the restaurant was a little stuffy but it was a nice gesture to leave with something from their market. Next time Im going to sit in the red room...it seemed prettier., This is old school fine dining at its finest.Ive tried almost everything on their menu from the summer of 2006, and while most of the dishes didnt rise to the sort of level that leaves a permanent memory with me, they were across the board solid. Furthermore, they served a seafood appetizer (phyllo wrapped shrimp, with squid and pan seared scallop in broth) that was truly sublime, and which did leave a permanent memory with me. Savory perfection.Everything about this restaurant makes you feel like youre sitting first class all the way. During one of my visits, a waiter accidentally spilled a tiny bit of sauce on the jacket of one of my dining companions. The waiters supervisor came out and apologized profusely, appearing genuinely concerned. He promised to pay the dry cleaning fees, and when my friend indicated that he didnt have a dry cleaner in the city yet, he recommended one to him that he felt was that best in the city. He appeared very sincere, and overall service at Bouley is a class act all the way., I had a really nice meal and a really nice time here for their lunch pre-fixe a few years back. Remember the food being excellent (but cant for the life of me remember what I ate). I do remember, that I adored the foyer full of citris. Mmm...Will have to go back to see if I remember correctly, and if this should really be a 5.Wasnt this useful?, DELICIOUS!!An excellent choice if youre dining in Tribeca. So yummy!, How could I have never reviewed this place!!!?? I was literally in shock when I noticed the write a review button readily available. Did someone delete my review from long ago?? Or did I really skip over this place@$!???David, youe an interesting guy and a pleasure to talk to.Your food however speaks for itself -- I need not say more than bless you with 5 Yelp stars. Bravo!Date Rating: 9Pick up Scale: 1Strong Suggestions: Be prepared for an enchanting evening., The first time I walked into BOULEY, I felt as if I had arrived at Home in Paris. The apple aroma wafting in the air was intixicating and the red vaulted ceiling was captivating. I love the decor as it really does evoke France at its most comforting. Charming bouquets at each table and adorable chandeliers add that French finish. BOULEY is really a refined place for lunch with best friends, especially girlfriends who love to splurge and have lavish attention along withfine food.Didier is an incredibly nice gentleman and excellent GM/Maitre d He really makes people feel special and he knows how to be attentive toeveryone.The wait staff is very professional and friendly, no snooty attitudes.Everytime I have lunched here it has been sublime and the amuse bouche are always excellent. The little touches add up to a grand experience. We were celebrating my birthday and we were presented with a fine dessert wine, similar to a sauternes - how lovely! After our desserts were served, a lovely creme brulee was brought to the table with a petite candle in a raspberry and Happy Birthday written in chocolate. All those extra flourishes were a gift of the house.The prix fixe is the way to go for lunch as it is always eequisite.If I lived in NYC it would be my choice for celebrations - any and all celebrations. Il just have to fly from the Right Coast for a Bouley Fix!The Bouley Bag is a lovely surprise as a parting gift., I just had Easter lunch here today and it is AMAZING. Blows Danube out of the water.Food:Chef Canape of celery sorbet, almond foam and marscapone cheese.Sashimi tuna with miso dressing and something else.Sauted foie gras with black truffles and figColorado lamb with ricotta gnocchi and mint reduction (table was also given a side of potatoe puree which was SALTY)Rubarb soup with blanc sorbetStrawberry shortcake (foam gelee) with rose petal sorbetBanana something amuseOther items which I did not get; but, tasted from my mother were an asparagus soup and lobster.The service was outstanding and also very warm and friendly (like the ambiance of the dining room).I am in love with the apple entrance and huge wooden door., Through the arched wooden door, pass the aromatic entrance of New York apples and seated under baroque coved crimson ceilings, the true experience of Bouley ignites once you have determined which of the two tasting menus set to make your day. Garnering an impressive and the only 29 out of 30 rating from Zagat, David Bouleys French heritage brings a classic foundation to new forms in cooking techniques that celebrates each ingredient as its own. The chefs canape could easily replace the minced tuna with shaved fennel option, when my palette was invigorated from the pairings of celery sorbet and marscapone cheese with Granny Smith foam and a touch of mint. It brought a nice transition to the following dish of tenderly pan seared seafood. Even laid atop an herbal broth, the scallop, squid, and crabmeat held their own flavors, while the phyllo crusted shrimp held a tougher texture. I was hoping my dining companion did not want to swap as I was convinced the Chatham Cod was the better choice with the early seasonal introduction of spring peas. Like the after-taste of freshly squeezed orange juice gone sour, the grapefruit gelee tattered the pleasant traces from the roasted maitake and buttermilk chicken dish I was so hesitant to trade for. But the sourness was soon forgotten once presented with the Molten-like Valrhona chocolate souffle adorned with maple, vanilla ice cream, and chocolate sorbet. Moments later, our spoons were sampling the sweet version of our savory canape of chocolate cream, espresso gelee, and spiced foam. We felt like we had won the dessert lottery when our table barely had room for the silver tray of petit-fours and walking out the same door with a lovely gift bag from the Bouley bakery. If not for the colorful floral arrangements adorning the room or the assorted samplings from the bread cart, Bouley is sure to brighten any mood. p.s. just know that the servers dont hesitate to keep pouring your beverage - even without asking - so they can charge you multiple $9 bottled water., Impressive! I had foie gras, because there is none to be (legally) had in Chicago.Loved the small touches -the things to nibble on in between courses, the loaf of bread to take home, and the apples in the entryway., I went for a late lunch yesterday. Reservation for two at 2pm. We both opted for the Tasting Menu, which is comprised of five courses of heaven for $48 per person. Some of the dishes I had: sashimi-quality tuna, tender Maine skate, a chicken and ravioli dish, the amazing chocolate souffle. The chefs canape, a tomato sorbet, was completely unexpected but flavorful and refreshing. Also, the breads! I had a slice of fig bread and tasted at least six others, including the garlic and the raisin. My least favorite parts of the meal included the meringue and the asparagus sorbet. Lunch was long, almost two hours. The service was very good, attentive (almost too attentive?). The portions were a good size because I had room to eat at least some of everything presented. The decor is a little stuffy (floral chintz fabrics and antiques everywhere). Still, highly recommended for a leisurely lunch., Being from the UK, Ive only managed to eat at Bouley 3 times but its an absolute pilgrimage for me on my annual trip to New York/New Jersey to ride roller coasters.The restaurant is about a minutes walk from Chambers Street station on the 1,2,3,9 line. The area seems safe enough though Ive only ever been here in the daytime.On my most recent trip in May of this year, I took a walk round the block as I had arrived early for my lunch appointment and looked at the other businesses that David Bouley is creating - Danube with its more Austrian menu and the bakery. Both looked lovely but I still stick by the French inspired original restaurant. Speaking to the maitre d, the restaurant is relocating to the building in the next block in September of this year and I hope that they keep the lovely decor, ambience and of course the food when they move.Behind the big solid wooden door, youre transported into a refined and sophisticated atmosphere. The waft of fresh apples found in baskets in the entrance hallway is an inspired move to welcome you and also to stimulate the appetite. Dress is smart casual but Ive seen guests dressed in smarter and less smart clothing and no-one is made to feel out of place.The waiting staff has a large French brigade. Service is always smart, attentive and knowledgeable. Ive had the privilege to have eaten in great restaurants across 3 continents and Bouley remains firmly in my top 3. The kitchen shows an almost Japanese-like approach to its food - the absolute confidence and belief in top-class ingredients to use a few ingredients well and get them to sing and harmonise on the plate without drowning each other out. The flavour combinations are well thought out, cooking techniques impeccable and presentation top-class.Ive always been tempted by the gorgeous sounding creations on the a la carte menu (can anyone tell me what Return to Chiangmai tastes like?) but have always settled for the tasting menu at lunchtime which represents fantastic value and allows me to try more dishes.For this visit, I started with a glass of freshly squeezed OJ which is surprisingly hard to get in classy restaurants. the bewildering choice of 7 different breads were of the highest calibre as usual but I knew to pace myself and not fill up too quickly with the feast to follow!The started of tomato sorbet, tomato gelee and gazpacho was just that - a hit of pure tomato flavour with the gelee to add textural variety. Perfect palate cleanser. I went for an appetizer that I had enjoyed before - a mixture of generous sized seafood, some with a phyllo crust to add crunch, offset by an ocean herb broth. The sweetness of the seafood was allowed to be the star with the herb broth subtly complementing it.The fish course of wild king salmon came with a dramatic sauce made with blood orange as well as clementines and mandarins but again, this didnt overpower the delicate taste of the salmon. I had had the opportunity to chat to the maitre d as I arrived right at the start of service and he very kindly sent over an extra course of Chatham cod which was equally delicious.The main course of pork was sensational - 2 different cuts but both cooked to melting tenderness yet retaining the earthy tones of pig. I havent seen it often on the menu but grab it while you can if it appears on the menu!Another sorbet to cleanse the palate and the meal was finished off with hot Valrhona chocolate souffle. The souffle was a lovely mini size as I was starting to panic about not being to eat it as I was pretty full by now. It came with the loveliest trio of different and distinctively flavoured ice creams.Although I didnt have coffee, I was delivered a plate of delightful petit fours.Another absolutely top notch meal! New Yorkers go and eat there! Keep up the great work guys, good luck with the move and keep up the standards at the new place! As Arnie said, Ill be back!|0
2|gotham-bar-and-grill-new-york|My favorite classic NY restaurant. The food is amazing. A bit pricey, but every penny of the experience. Good for business dinners or with a friend. My friend and I shared the sea scallops. A bit pricey, $17 for two, but good. I had miso marinated black cod for dinner. It was amazing!! I loved and savored every bit. The fish was perfectly crispy and juicy with miso flavor. Not too strong. I loved the shiitake mushrooms in the sauce. The dessert was the best part. It was a trio dessert. So I had 3 little desserts on my plate. I was torn between everything on the menu. I decided on the white chocolate peanut butter mousse, banana tarte tatain and rice crispies. I loved the banana tarte. Everything was great! I loved how I got to taste three totally different desserts. I would go back just to try the rest of the desserts on teh menu., amazing service.paparadelle with duck was perfect.good for an expense account, Hey Gotham Grill...1982 called, they want their furniture back. Although the decor is dated...these vertical high rise culinary delights will not disappoint., Its a bit on the expensive side (dinner for four cost me close to $400, including wine and appetizers), but it is absolutely worth it. From the moment you walk in the door, you are treated as a guest; the wait staff is extremely knowledgable about the food and wine; and for some reason, the bread keeps coming at a rapid pace while you wait for your appetizers. It was quite astonishing, as a matter of fact--youd reach down to finish your last bite of bread, the next moment thered be another piece on your plate. We believe that they give their staff training in stealth and speed. We had, among the four of us, a baby organic green salad, tuna tartare, grilled steak with bordelaise sauce, roast chicken, grilled salmon, and a few other things which I didnt try. By the time the dessert menus appeared, we were all too full to even think about ordering anything else. Suddenly, however, a plate full of the most luscious min-desserts you can imagine appeared on our table! (Stealth waiters, I tell you!) We all sampled tiny little bite-sized versions of cheesecake, chocolate tarts, souffles, and more. Perfection!, Chef Alfred Portale is a world-renown culinarian. I love this place. When I visited NYC for a week I made a point of coming here at least once. Gothams decor has its own unique look and feel. Also, the food is one-of-a-kind. Dining at Gotham Bar and Grill was an experience Ill never forget., Ive been to Gotham at least 10 times last year, for both lunches and dinners, and every single time was a winner. I want to say it is impossible to have a bad experience at this restaurant. The food and service are consistently outstanding, especially the fish. Dont miss Gotham., gotham is as good as it gets, its delicious fine dining without the pretentiousness. spot-on service and an everchanging, new american menu have proved that you dont have to head way uptown for one of the best meals in the city. everything shines at gotham, but i strongly recommend the venison if they have it, damn good. bring yer wallet., Pricey, but worth every penny. We went all out on all three courses and dessert for a birthday dinner, and every single dish was amazing -- the seared foie gras, in particular, was so tender and soft, it practically melted in your mouth. Every dish is fantastic, although the notables are the black cod, crispy black bass, and the amazing rack of lamb. As for the desserts... the Gotham chocolate cake is rich but not too sweet -- perfect way to end dinner. And even if you decide to skip dessert, they give you a tray of six small sweets with the check! Cant wait to go back., Ive been to Gotham Bar & Grill many times, but only twice to eat a meal. I really enjoy coming here to have dessert at the bar. You can even have a walk-in meal there if you like. There are bar tops specifically designed to cover the bar railing and provide an elevated dining platform for your pleasure. But back to dessert. I dont know if the same pastry chef is still there, but I believe she used to work, or was going to work, on Wall St. And then 9/11 happened, and she made a career change - truly for the greater good. It was a sad day indeed when GB&G took the Tahitian vanilla creme brulee off the dessert menu. A wonderfully crunchy crust and a custard that made you want to lick the ramikin. The portions were just right. Unlike the mystifying creme brulee at Keens steakhouse (served in a bowl way too deep), GB&Gs creme brule guaranteed enough crunchy crust for each spoon of custard. But enough of the past. The dessert menu changes seasonally, if not more frequently. Meyer lemon ice cream? Reimagined Smores (check pics)? Choose one of their enjoyable teas or strong coffees (Ill take mine black, thanks) to wash it down. Just when you think youre done, some petite fours appear out of nowhere. Gratis. Have a cheap meal somewhere else and have dessert here. Youll feel like a million bucks. Oh, and the bartenders are all friendly, know the menu and can discuss the strengths of each dessert (or will inquire for you in the kitchen). I like Chikalicious, but Im surprised that GB&G rarely comes up. Just more dessert for me. And now you., Ive brought friends and family here on numerous occasions and always loved the food. Lunch and DInner are fabulous, try to come here during Restaurant Week in June for the abso-fabso Prix Fixe menu. Wine List is excellent. Meat cuts are choice. Vegetables are fresh and crisp. And I love the downstairs ladies room soooo much. Go for the stall on the end so you can have your own sink and primp privately before returning to your date., My girls and I came here for dinner on Christmas Eve and decided to settle in to eat at the bar. This is fun, because Gotham has little customized trays to make this experience even more comfortable. Everything we ordered was SO yummy and our drinks were great. Splurge and get some dessert. The staff was incredibly friendly as were the patrons who werent a bit pretentious. The prices however--youll most definitely have to save up for awhile, but its worth it!, Pricey? Definitely. Worth it? I had the roasted monkfish with foie gras ravioli and I would have been happy to take it home to bed instead of the date that night. At least he was good for one thing. This place was the trendsetter and hot spot about 12 years ago, but still going strong today., Ive been going to Gotham for over 12 years now, and, while it is still quite good, it certainly isnt the mind-blowingly-perfect experience it was in the 90s. Clearly, the meals are prepared and served competently, and the wines and desserts are well-thought-out. But the service can be spotty, and the restaurant doesnt appear to be staffed with same quality it once was. Ive had situations where my waitress interjected into a private conversation (with incorrect information, mind you), and Ive seen staff bad-mouth other restaurants to patrons. In the past couple years, Ive seen situations where patrons couldnt get servers attention -- not something that used to happen. Bad service experiences can turn even the most perfectly-tuned meal into something regrettable. Unfortunate then, that the menu has become much more hit-or-miss. Ive noticed that many of the best choices are ones that Portale put on the menu when the place was newly-opened. Lately the kitchen seems to be more certain with its seafood, and less sure of its red-meat entrees. Now, if you go to Gotham, will you get a good meal? Without a doubt. You might expect a very good meal. But, youll very certainly be paying for it, and Id wager you might be saying that it wasnt quite worth the cost... especially with some other choices in the neighborhood, like Mesa, Sel de Terre, Veritas, Gramercy Tavern, etc.. Take your parents there, take business clients or your boss there, and expect a dinner that is... reliable. Unfortunately, you can no longer expect one that is magical., Best deal in town! Fabulous $24.07 prix fixe 3-course lunch. My first course was a puree of cauliflower soup with scallops; then salmon grilled to perfection over black olive and olive oil tapenade; ending with delicious chocolate cake and pomegranate sorbet. Great acoustics -- I dont know how they do it. Every table was taken, there were some groups at the big round tables near us, but for such a large restaurant with very high ceilings, it was incredibly quiet. My friends and I all could talk and hear each other comfortably without having to shout. This was truly one of my favorites of the prix fixe lunches around the city., I enjoyed my lunch experience at Gothams. The miso glazed black cod was perfection!, I have been coming here since the 90s, and even if the restaurant is not the flavor of the month anymore, and maybe if it has slipped a bit, its still a standout in a town with so many great restaurants and so many that are simply over-hyped. If Alfred Portales restaurant was the place to be and be seen, it was for a good reason. The tall dishes he is so famous for creating (I believe he is the one who started this trend), had heavenly deliciousness in every bite. I especially liked the tuna tartar. Service was attentive, without being overly stuffy, and the atmosphere was happening. Funny story: I was once supposed to meet another couple for dinner here from out of town, and I happened to take my car I usually never drive in Manhattan, and I kept going in circles due to a one way street situation nearby. By the time I got there, the couple had left (I was an hour late!) but when I explained the situation to the hostess, she realized how stressed out I was and gave me a glass of champagne on the house, which I had consumed at a table near the bar. (Good bar scene, by the way). I was alone, and I was by now starving, so they seated me at a great table, and I had a most delicious meal and several glasses of excellent red wine. I was not in the least bit uncomfortable, and the waiter and hostess kept coming over to me to chat. The couple in NJ, they missed out big-time, unfortunately. I still feel very badly about it and owe them. The moral: dont ever take your car downtown! And if you do, you have to stop at the Gotham!, This is our favorite restaurant in NY! One of our friends referred us to this place and we didnt know it was a formal upscale restaurant. We thought it was a Bar & Grill! LOL! We were totally underdressed in shorts and tshirts. But the food was just yummy! The price is a bit high but its worth every penny!! Guys you need to take ur gals to this place for dinner!, a great place for lunch and as it happens is an Alfred Portale restaurant. one day i was strolling by, which was coincident to my hunger, i decided to have lunch here. of course i did not have a reservation, but they let me in anyway. i ate at the bar and chatted with the friendly bartender who as it turned out was from the Bay Area. food was a great value for lunch. i was suprised considering it was a Portale restaurant.Buen Provecho!, Great food for both lunch and dinner. And the food is beautifully presented--Portale is known for his tall food so part of the fun is just waiting to see what your plate will look like.The food itself is very good---never had a bad meal here. And the bar is also pretty good sized so you can sit and relax here for a drink after work and actually be able to hear the other person speak., Very classy new American restaurant. Mmmm ... my belly is still full of rack of lamb as I type this. It was cooked perfectly, and my only regret is that I didnt order the sweet corn soup (with lobster, tomato and bacon). My favorite part was the tray of little bitty desserts at the end!! My friends and I agreed that eating here makes you feel like youre in a movie. Something about the decor, and the attractive clientele and waitstaff. Of course, you pay for it too, so be smart and go here when someone else is picking up the tab. Or, take advantage of the $25 prix fixe lunch special.|0
3|gramercy-tavern-new-york|after all the hype i gotta say that some of it is true. the service, atmosphere, and attention this place shows for detail is huge. the traditional amuse coming forth, was off the hook. i had a great time here. there was excellent wine to choose from, cheeses that an frenchman would envy, and you get what you expect. the monkfish was tender,but the shredded veg it came with was mottled together, and ther was no taste difference. the sweetbreads were crisp, while maintaining thier moist, tender inside. the steak was perfect, and untampered with, salt and pepper only complimented it wonderfully. the food is unpretentious and cooked to perfection.all in all a wonderful experience and it almost lived up to the hype., Both times I have been here I have had exquisite food and service. The atmosphere is inviting and unpretentious. The service floats around you and is extremely well choreographed. The food is outstanding with good portion sizes (not too big or too small). You leave feeling extremely satsified. Great place for business lunches or to take your parents for dinner., old school restaurant with old school service.professional, and a bit over the top.the decor is floral, park avenue money.the cheese tasting menu is excellentthe filet mignon was greatlobster was overcookedgood for business dinner, The best service in New York City, bar none. Anyone with a working credit card is welcome here and the tasting menus are sublime. Vegetable only tasting menus for the veggie-lovers, too. Make sure you have the cheese plate and ask to match it with one of their delicious ciders. A great place to go for the New York experience without the New York attitude., A hands-down great restaurant and highly enjoyable all-around dining experience. Forget about the back seating area that requires reservations. The front dining area near the bar is more fun, more affordable, and is first-come, first-serve. The filet-mignon is excellent. Finish it off with an apple crisp with cream cheese and rasberry ice cream to share with the table. Expect to wait about an hour at the bar before getting a table. But enjoy the wait, order a few, and know that you are in one of the best restaurants in town., Amazing service, atmosphere. nothing beats the whole experience! i have never been so well serviced in my whole life. it was seamless...i had no idea when they filled my water, but they did throughout the night. service was impeccable and is a perfect place to bring someone you want to impress. The food is good, not the best, but still good enough such that the food combined with the service and atmosphere make it an amazing experience. also if you dont want to spend much money go to the bar - its a tad bit cheaper!, This establishment has a reputation of being one of the best restaurants in the city, but I have never actually eaten here. However, me and my friends stopped in for a drink once and let me tell you this place does not take kindly to 10 people ordering lemon drops at the bar while people are eating monkfish. I am pretty sure the bartender was pressing the panic button., A lovely, comfortable place at which I am always happy to be. Almost everything Ive had was delicious, a statement which is only qualified by the dishes which were merely very good. Great beer selection with seasonal taps paired to the menu. Its so home., Always a good standby, Gramercy Tavern is a reliable good food destination. However, despite saying that, it is a little overhyped. Service was attentive and quick and the ambiance was very comfortable. Dessert was fantastic - the lemon souffle was light and sweet and the cocktails were great! The rabbit main dish I had was very well cooked. However, not all of it was that great. The sweetbreads were too large and too rich - sweetbreads are delicate and should be served in small, well-cooked portions.. but overall a good experience, just maybe not worth all the hype., We loved Gramercy Tavern. it is casually elegant, and everything was delicious. what a lovely cheese list, and i was surprised and delighted to get to try a Claudia Fleming dessert (she was consulting)....which i adored., An unintimidating restaurant with unbelievable everything, this tavern had a warm and inviting feel. I had the rabbit. (Sorry to those of you freaking out about my eating Thumper.) The rabbit was amaaaazing. It was so soft and juicy. It wasn tough at all, and I could just picture a fat, fluffy bunny who did nothing but sit there and eat carrot after carrot. I sorry, Thumper. For dessert, I had the apricot tart, and it was reeeally awesome. It was beautifully presented and tasted even more wonderful. My tummy says thankee to Thumper & Co., not bad...not bad, i say. 1. Appetizer Bread: nothing special2. Lobster something (served cold): juicy, cold, awesome.3. top sirloin & braised short ribs: meat, more meat, brown sauce to accentuate the meatyness...too much meatyness for my taste.4. dessert (hazelnut mousse?): ok5. coffee: french pressed and goodbill? $130 a head with champagne., Its good. Its really good. Its not perfect though which is why it got 4 stars and not 5. The service is attentive but just a tad frosty at times for my tastes. Ive enjoyed everything Ive had there. From the little amuse bouche to get you started to the muffin you get at the end of your meal. (At that price it damn well better cover two meals!). I have had friends show signs of disappointment on beef dishes in the past, but Ive always had wonderful experiences with their lamb and seafood preparation. Portions are perfectly sized, not small but not overly large. Wine list is extensive and has options that wont break the bank (the food bill will already take care of that....). And that coffee...Ill probably never be able to pronounce it but its delish. Overall, its a wonderful dining experience., I had one of the most enjoyable and indulgent dining experiences at the Gramercy Tavern. We truly celebrated in style here! This place is all about service, and about really enjoying your company and your meal. The waiters do not rush you at all, which is almost difficult to get used to in a city thats so rush-rush-rush all the time. We started the evening off with incredible cocktails before ordering a bottle of wine to go with our meals. We each had a different and delicious appetizer. Everyone seemed to love their main course, and I especially loved the tasty salt-baked sea bass that I ordered. Im not used to three hour dinners, but somehow the hours just flew by as we ate and talked and celebrated. This was a very romantic old-New York kind of restaurant, and I had a lovely time., mmm this place is practically a new york institution. its big on power lunches as you can gather from the businessmen around you but the service never falters. the food is great and the dessert is even better, although I must say Im a little biased because my friend is a pastry chef there but I swear its inventive and some of the best Ive ever had., I went for a late 2pm lunch on saturday and it was some of the best food Ive ever had. I got the filet and it was better than any of those overpriced wood-panneled steakhouses (Im talking to you Capital Grille!). The ambiance was relaxed and pleasant. The waitress checked in regularly to make sure everything was perfect. And it was. And for the quality we got, the bill wasnt bad at all.From now on, I go to Gramercy Tavern as much as possible., This restaurant served one of the best meals Ive had during my brief stay in NYC. All of the staff from the hostess to the server were very accommodating and friendly. However, good service alone does not get you the stars. The food surely does. I ordered the crab puree with sweat peas, pink peppercorns, and bacon. I had a very minor quibble with the peppercorns not being blended in perfectly but it was not enough to detract from the dish as a whole. I ordered the rabbit for my main course which was perfectly tender and fit well with the shallots, sausage, and olives. The potato puree was served in a separate container and was whipped to the right consistency.This place will definitely be a repeat experience the next time I find myself in NYC., After the end of a delicious 7 course meal, we were completely satisfied with the flawless food , and perhaps a little drunk, but not overly stuffed. We were, however, very surprised to find that the check at the end of the meal was twice as much as wed expected.For the duration of the meal, we were treated suprisingly well, especially after we had ordered. I reckon the service is always top knotch, but our waiter was especially friendly. We realized why when we noticed that instead of the modest $70 bottle of wine we thought had ordered, what we had ordered was, in fact, a $300 bottle. Oops.So, this means that Gramercy Tavern was a painfully expensive meal. But the room felt warm, the service was perfect, and although its an upscale and especially sophisticated restaurant, it did not feel stuffy. . . which made the check somewhat more palatable. Well definitely be back for a special occasion., Had lunch here with a couple co-workers, and the food, service and ambiance were all wonderful. The most memorable part of the meal, however, was the coconut tapioca dessert. It made me forget everything else we had just eaten. It made Don O. forget to write anything in his review!, I just got back from NYC and had the most amazing lunch there. My friend and I chose to do the summer tasting menu and it was delicious. The scallops were cooked to perfection, the turbo was delicate and the rack of lamb was like butter on the tongue. Also the service was perfection... thanks Kevin you really took care of us! I would highly recommend this place and will make sure I stop by next time I am in NYC.|0
4|mk-restaurant-chicago|Every time I eat here, it reaffirms that MK is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. From the service (two waiters per table) to the food, it is unbelievable. Youre able to order a la carte off the tasting menu in addition to the regular menu. The fish is always fresh, meats are cooked perfectly, and the presentation is just beautiful. Desserts are also great - try the CakenShake or the Peanutbutter Cup., MK has been around awhile, but I finally had the chance to try it (twice!) this past year. The ambience is very modern urban, but still warm and cozy. It has a real lofty feel with huge floor to ceiling windows and exposed brick. I havent sat upstairs yet, but can imagine the view over the restaurant would be pretty cool. Although they have a pretty eclectic menu, the NY strip my date had was still cooked to perfection with an amazing sweet reduction sauce. Ive had the lamb, as well as the ahi tuna (I think here I preferred the ahi tuna if I had to choose). The starters were some of the best Ive had as well: a salad with mango and cold lobster with a tangy vinaigrette was awesome as well as the butternut squash with brown butter and sage. Oh and the frites with white truffle oil are a standard. The one thing that still stands out is the bread/butter presentation - its the creamiest butter Ive ever had, and they give you a big square slab sprinkled with sea salt - yum!, MK is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago and I recommend it to anyone who asks me for a place to go for someplace special. It strikes a perfect balance between upscale/urban/loft and comfortable, not overly pretentious. It definitely a beautiful people place though so be prepared to get the lookover by the folks waiting for tables when you walk in. Once you get to your seats, the waitstaff is curteous and helpful. Several times I have requested the table overlooking the restaurant in the lofted area and gotten it - it a great place to sit, eat, and people watch. It reminds me of the lofted space in DC Coast in Washington, DC. As for food, the tuna was excellent; ie also had the halibut. If there is a weak point to the restaurant, it is the desserts - they are not to die for but they do have moscato for after dinner drinks so just get your sugar that way. :)UPDATE: Had dinner at MK recently. One of the only places that I ever get a good table (for some reason I get crappy tables at restaurants wherever I go) but I don know if I going to be going back there for awhile. Business partner and I took our SO there for a celebration of multiple things. As we were enjoying coffee and dessert, the manager of the restaurant told us there was another 4-top waiting for our table, they were very discriminating patrons and very specific about the table they want to sit in, so could we please leave and go to the bar. This after dropping over $500 which maybe isn so much these days. Admittedly, we were 30 minutes late for our reservations, but come on; asking people to leave? Ie referred MANY MANY people to MK for a special occasion, I may still but now it will be with a big fat asterisk., I liked the ambience and service very much.The food was very good, but a bit bland for such a raved about restaurant. My husband steak was, to quote a dining companion, unapologetically beefy, read, practically unseasoned. I had the pasta, which, although tasty, was essentially buttered egg noodles with morel mushrooms scattered atop.That being said, the steak tartare was excellent, as were the desserts. Definitely aim for one of the more adventuresome entrees though, so youe not eating something you could get anywhere else for less money., I love the decor and set up of the restaurant, and the food was phenomenal - even the fries! I ordered the salmon and it was delicious - flavorful, and melts in your mouth. This was overall a wonderful experience. My only complaint is that its a little bit cramped - I sat on the bench side of the table, and my leg was touch the purse of the women next to me, and we could hear everything the people said on either side. Not super romantic, due to the above, but yummy food!, We went on a double date here last night. The guys had been before, and us girls were newcomers. The guys were surprised at the raise in price, but Im not sure how long ago they had visited. The experience was good - wonderful professional service, lovely atmosphere (Im a big fan of the floating candles in the lounge), and tasty food. Everyone seemed satisfied with their entrees, though I guess nobody was blown away by them. The appetizers were a hit all around - the eggplant, the lobster soup, the carrot puree soup and the goat cheese salad. We also had the pommes frites (truffle fries), which were delicious. Far and away, the desserts were amazing. The peanut butter & chocolate, the cake and shake, and the sweet potato tart. Yum! Oh, and the wine list was so big that it had a table of contents. Im glad I wasnt the one picking the wine!, Pros: unimpeachable food. Everything is in fine, inventive taste - appetizers and sushi are fresh and scrumptious, poultry entrees are cooked and seasoned to tender, savory perfection (if they have squab, get it or regret it), meats are decadent, veg sides and potatoes are light and flavorful, and the best wines in the country flow freely at fair prices. Do not miss aforesaid pommes frites. Servers are unintrusive, swift, erudite and shaggable.Atmosphere is dreamy, elegant, imposing. Wear a damn tie and rub elbows with power brokers and their escorts.Cons: cocktails. Charging $15+ for Ketel One with some fruit juice isn chic, it statutory rape., One of the best New American food places in the city. I usually try not to order the same things twice when I go out, but the meal I had here (twice) was just wonderful. The NY sirloin is one of the best Ive had anywhere. I ordered it the first time on a whim, and when I asked the waiter what I should get the second time, he started drooling and telling me to get the NY sirloin again -- that made my decision easy. The Cake n Shake dessert will leave you feeling great at the end of the night. The ambiance is great and could work equally well for a business dinner, date, or a night out with a group of friends., Ive only been here once but this is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. The inside is beautiful - its very sophisticated without being either too trendy or too stuffy. At first I was a little disappointed when we were seated in the second floor loft area, but then I realized that that is probably the best place to sit because you can look out over the whole restaurant and avoid some of the noise. As I recall they bring you out these fabulous little cookies at the end of the meal - but beware if you ask for more they will charge you! I will definitely be back to MK., Great service, Great Food and deserves every award for best new restaurants it continues to get from food critics, Ok, I havent been here for well over a year but I do dream about it often. Everything is so delicous and fresh and a surprise but not in a weird way. Their food is a gift to us, the enjoying public. The truffle fries will keep you happy for weeks...they are that mezmerizing. Gosh, I really want to go back soon., MK is a consistently memorable experience. Service, wines, salads, desserts, entrees - all of it. All of it. Well worth your paycheck for a special night out that delivers against the reputation., My girlfriend office party was held at MK this year. Here the skinny:The food deserves of a 5 star review on its own. The steak was increadible. At medium-rare the coloration was PERFECT and it cut like a knife through warm butter. My chicken was not only superb, but also came in impressive quantity. The gnocchi appetizer was possibly the best thing Ie tasted this year.MK loses 2 stars on service. Wait staff treated EVERYONE like they were piss-drunk (even us sober ones). Nothing says I don give a crap about my customers like...- grabbing them to shove them out of the way... - serving desert with no silverware, forcing people to eat apple crumble with breadknives. - loitering in the stairwell so your guests can get by (unless they say excuse me... twice).Go to MK for the food, but don expect much from the service. If I was less in awe of the gnocchi, the service may have earned this place a 2 or 3 star review.EDIT: Reduced to 2 stars when I found out a waiter touched my girlfriend rather intimately to push her out of the way. AND our host paid $12,000 for the party and they cut off the booze for everyone because one girl had 1 too many., Ive been here once, and it was awesome. The decor is sophisticated, and I loved both the food and wines that were suggested to go with. This was a special dinner and the manager was very attentive without being overbearing. My party left satisfied after sitting for nearly 3 hours...I love long dinners!, Great food and ambience, but I dont know what the fuss is all about. Beautiful presentation, no major complaints, but definitely expensive for the small portions - next time Ill eat more of the bread and amuse-bouche (a nice touch) so Im not left hungry., Ernie Banks...Ernie freakinbest Cub in history Banks. That who we sat near when we at at MK. This man held court all night, shaking hands, posing for pictures, signing cards, giving cards out.If that does not a great dining experience make, I don know what does.But seriously...MK...where do I begin?I ate at MK for the first time four years ago...and hated it. It was springtime, and the menu was typical spring fare...soft shell crab, spring peas, etc. It was unremarkable and no better than anything I had had ten years earlier at Olive in Boston (back when it was unique and good).But last night was remarkable...not great, but so much better than that first time. Here my capsule review:MK is not going to change the world with its approach to food. It is typical fine dining fare -- the best hits of the fine dining world, well prepared but missing that certain something that separates a good restaurant from a great restaurant. In MK case it is small details: a lack of textural contrasts on a plate; muddied flavors, buried under oils or butter or aioli; a piece of meat, not cooked to the correct temperature. The details are seemingly minor but make all the difference in the enjoyment of a meal.The staff is friendly and helpful -- in our case, when our server forgot a drink, she comped it and brought it out later. Wine service was careful and doting; the sommelier was unpretentious and concerned. One note: I really disliked the Truffle Aioli that was served with the pomme frites...truffle oil and home made mayo are a horrible combination. The flavor contrasted with an earlier dish we ate that was made with fresh Perigord truffles -- they were mild, slightly earthy, and pleasant. The truffle flavor in the Aioli was punishing and sharp. If there one thing I wish restaurants would get rid of, it would be truffle oil. Hear me, MK?, this place touches the outer boundaries of a ny vibe. the 2nd tier seating which looks out to the rest of the place is very cosmopolitan. staff are well trained, food is well prepared, other patrons are well dressed...its well, a pretty safe bet to take just about anyone for dinner. there is something about their french fries..., Best seared tuna in the city! (well at least of all the places I have been), they make it with this red wine syrup, spinach and gourmet mashed potatoes. I put 4 stars because I heard they stopped serving it, but the rest of their food is good too and the atmosphere is very versatile. They have Kobe beef which is really popular and you must order the Pomme Frites. As foe the atmosphere...it is nice enough to be romantic if there are two of you, big enough and trendy enough to be fun for a group, and if you go during the week it even works for business functions., if mk is good enough for Grant Achatz, its good enough for me.after being stiffed by the bouncer @ Stone Lotus on All Hallows Eve (which, btw, was FREEZING), we walked over to mk for dessert.lo n behold, Mr. Aschatz himself was entertaining a blonde on each arm at the lounge. We plopped ourselves right in front of their party and proceeded to polish our nite off w/ a bottle of moscato and a few desserts. Bourdain greater than Aschatz greater than Ernie. (baseball? is that a sport?), The best food and service Ive had in my life.You can taste the quality and love in every bite. Everyone there was there for a true food experience. The waitstaff was really into the food as well and I saw our server to be an extension of the chef, he was that interested in sharing the foods journey from farm to plate with us.All the service was so wonderful I felt like we were the only two people in the busy place. Above and beyond!I havent been there in a bit but I now judge other experiences on my MK experience. Its not fair to the other restaurants.|0
5|morimoto-new-york|Okay... so I biased. I used to work here. But here a great opportunity for me to tell people what my favorite dishes and what I generally think of the restaurant. First off, there is a Morimoto in Philly and that where Iron Chef Morimoto has his first namesake restaurant. I hear it smaller and less trendy but still visually impressive and good food. Cocktails: Try the White Lily. It made with sudachi shocho, calpico and yuzu juice. Have you had a Louisiana satsuma fruit? Well, this is it, in a martini glass. I also like the Autumn Leaf. If you like chai lattes, youl like this. Apps: Tried and true and therefore not very adventurous- go with the Rock Shrimp Tempura. You get 3oz of deep fried rock shrimp in Morimoto buffalo sauce and another 3oz of fried shrimp in a wasabi aioli. Pretty presentation, go with the Zen Sai. It a Japanese antipasto plate. You get salmon sushi wrapped in bamboo leaf, mackerel wrapped in cedar wood, duck meatballs, califlower flan with lobster meat and lobster consomme, and a small bowl of sesame dofu. Toro tartare is also very pretty though not much food. So it not a great one to share. You get 7 condiments to go with the toro ranging from nori paste to avocado puree. Oysters foie gras is fantastic. You get 3 oysters topped with uni and foie with a little terriyaki reduction. It all served over aromatic salt and spices so the dish smells lovely. The lamb carpaccio is a small portion by the ginger scallion dressing with raw meat is so freakindelicious that youl savor every little bite! Also the foie gras chowan mushi is fabulous. Small, but rich and creamy with just a little thinly sliced duck meat to top it off. Entrees: People seem to order to buri bop a lot but it not my favorite. I find that it prepared at the table with too much sauce and the dish just doesn do it for me. Instead, I prefer the Iron Chef chicken noodle soup the pork kakuni (which is really an appetizer) and the Wagyu ribeye. Honestly, I an appetizer person. I love to try little bits of everything so entrees are less appealing to me. Too much commitment to one dish! The decor is beautiful though a bit cold for my taste. I like eating in places where I feel very comfortable and cozy. This is a place you come to when youe feeling swanky and showy. Like, youe here to be seen and cause a scene. It definitely NOT the neighborhood-y restaurant that I adore so much as the behemoth establishment you and your friends get together to go and splurge. Youl most likely do some celebrity spotting when you come in and there definitely a buzz about the place that makes it fun. If youe out to impress a client or you have a date that likes the sparkly, good life, this is a great place to check out., The space is well designed, although situated on an empty block of 10th, directly across from Mario Batalis new spot. They are swarmed with staff, all of them friendly, casual, attentive and without any attitude, and it was the best service I remember. The o-toro was tender, melted well, and we shared the tofu cheesecake and the chocolate torte, which may sound unspectacular but reached an amazing level of richness, flavor and smoothness. This was considered by everyone to be the best dessert. The bar downstairs is quite cool. Im not a fan of the Miami Vice aquamarine glass, but the space is nice, a combo of low seats for private conversation, and barspace. A great place to meet for a drink or go for the omakase seating. Their separate styles of seating is interesting without seeming to ghettoize anyone in some netherworld of seating. They had 12 sushi chefs working behind the bar, and it all looked efficient, featuring kohada and aji. The kohada was firm and clean, but I wouldnt say the fish was particularly superb compared to other spots, although you could easily do worse and pay more. They only take reservations up to 1 month in advance. A place appropriate for your friends, a date or your family. It has a cool, modern vibe, not too dark. I would like to return for the omakase seating., Passed by after eating at Buddakan. We walked in and were impressed with the layout, the crowd, the feel, and the bottles on the wall!! First read about it in DailyCandy (dailycandy.com/article.j206). We went downstairs and sat at the bar for drinks. Not very noisy and the talent is... very eye catching ;-) We plan to go back soon for dinner., While the architecture in this place is absolutely amazing (and worth a visit for that alone) I found the quality of the food to be less than perfect, which is what it should have been for the price. But as anyone should know going to this spot, you are going for the scene and not necessarily the best food on the planet. Dont get me wrong - the Iron Chef runs a pretty tight ship over there, and was even behind the sushi bar the night we went. The toro tartare and rock shrimp tempura were mouth watering. But then the sushi sampler (that came out in a giant porcelain pot that takes two people to carry) was so-so, A+ on presentation, but a C on flavor. Id prefer Blue Ribbon over the Iron Chef anyday., Yes. This is New York. A crazy restaurant in the meatpacking district. Totally insane overdone space in the middle of fng nowhere. Glimpses of a celebrity chef that I used to gawk at before anyone knew what Iron Chef even was. Great background music. Rockstar lookalikes. Yellow cabs and limos hanging around outside. Damn right.A few less than sober friends tried to go take pictures of Morimoto during our meal. He seemed to disappear when they approached. The manager said that he would come to our table. He didn. That rules. I wouldn have either. Morimoto rocks.Yes, I can easily find better sushi at any number of places in the city (Gari!). Yes, I can definitely find better noodles (Momofuku!). I sure I can find better modern/japanese/american/fusion/nonsense entrees if I bothered to try. But, it not about that. It about spending a ridiculous amount of money to hang out at a high end space with beautiful people and amazingly presented dishes. It about indulging in the absurdity of life and what it has to offer. In this regard, Morimoto succeeds amazingly. Morimoto is like high-end clothes shopping. In the end, do the clothes I buy at Hugo Boss make me look better than the clothes that I buy at the Gap? No, probably not. Do I enjoy shopping at Hugo Buss much more, and having an attentive staff cater to my every whim while laughing at the riffraff outside? Hells yes.Rock on, Morimoto., Yes, its another large restaurant in the Meat Packing District... t my girlfriend and I enjoyed it! Service was very friendly and we fell in love with the restaurant concierge (I never knew there was such a thing as a restaurant concierge... we dont have them in San Francisco...) who was absolutely adorable and gave us great ideas on what to do in the area Thurs nite (hes the one who recommended Cielo... YES!)Food was very good although definitely on the pricier side (1 piece of nigiri was $6.. so basically double). But our final bill was reasonable at $100 for 2 people and we ate til we were satisfied (were both pretty big eaters, our boyfriends will attest to this!).Downstairs was their bar... seemed quiet which surprised me, but the bartenders were very nice.Definitely recommend checking it out... if you have the cash to burn you can also sit at the special table (think theres a $200/person minimum)... heard you can see the Iron Chef himself in action?, I had an awesome experience at Morimoto. We went there for dinner with an expense account last night...so yes, we were able to order whatever we wanted to. The three of us started with Kumamoto Oysters...despite the fact that I really not a big oyster fan, I thought they were super good. We also got the lobster fritters and steamed scallops as appetizers. The lobster fritters were SOOOOO good. The cocktails were original and pretty strong. I got the White Lily - super yummy, as well as the Lightening Thunder. For entrees, we got the surf and turf...the lobster was to die for. The kobe NY strip was pretty good too. Our server was very friendly...and was very attentive. He kept on cracking jokes at us...(I think he was totally hitting on my coworker). Whatever his intentions were, the service was excellent. I took 1 star away because the desserts were kinda disappointing. For one thing, nothing seemed too authentic...we got the creme brulee, cheesecake and the pecan pie, and none of it was really japanese. We concluded our night there with a tour of the restaurant. We half jokingly asked our server if we could get a tour of the establishment, and he got the manager (Kevin) to give us a tour. I have an entire different appreciation of the establishment after the tour. Everything there was a masterpiece. From the resin bar top downstairs to the wall made out of water bottles that stands two storey high!, Ive eaten here three times and let me say: MMMMM... oh-toro!! This is the first thing I think of when I hear morimoto restaurant mentioned and sometimes its the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning. Do you love sushi? Sashimi? You do? Well, then you should DEFINITELY try the most fantastilicious sashimi ever. Oh-toro. Its fatty tuna. When you eat it, its like eating a slice of heaven. Its so soft and so fresh that it melts in your mouth and slides down your throat smoothly and delicately. Not a sushi or sashimi fan? Well, Id say try this stuff anyway because its so good... but if youre allergic to it DO NOT TRY IT. Tasty, delicious sashimi is no reason to sacrifice your life. Okay, well if you REALLY arent into sushi or sashimi Morimoto does offer a wide variety of other delicious dishes. And his Asian fusion creations are so innovative and creative that I doubt youd be unable to find a dish that youd love. I would definitely recommend the Rock Shrimp Tempura which comes w/ a wasabi aioli and spicy type aioli. (Side note: When the restaurant first opened they had a buffalo sauce aioli but then I wrote in the comment card that they should change it to the aioli in the Philly restaurant and THEY DID! O_O) Basically, the food and drinks are great, the service is fantastic- all of the staff is so friendly and accomodating, they go the extra mile to make your experience wonderful. The decor is wonderful! Its sleek, modern and simple... and the bottle wall is gorgeous. PLUS they have phenomenal bathrooms. I mean like WOW. You didnt think bathrooms could be that amazing? Well, sit down on these magical toilets (which have heated seats) and you will see a remote on the side that will wash and dry your butt in a serene setting. I love this restaurant through and through but my major gripe is that I feel its overpriced, but I suppose youre not just paying for fantastic service and food, youre paying for the name of Mr. Masaharu Morimoto (who you will find behind the sushi bar or floating around amongst the tables- hes been there all three times Ive gone). If youd like to try the restaurant but find it to be too stressful on your wallet, just go in and ask to sit at the bar and order a drink (try the White Lily as a cocktail! Its delicious!  I think its $12) and maybe even share an appetizer. I definitely recommend going here to try the food.. and if youre not a crazy food lover like myself, definitely go to try the magical toilets. ;D, I still like the food here better than the Morimoto in Philly. Either way it an experience any way you look at it and if youe going for outrageous food you can do better.Attentive service, excellent combinations for sushi rolls. Very fresh Maguro, loved the eel avocado rolls! Romance Factor: 7Hobnob Potential: 3Destination Rating: 6Strong Suggestions: Go here to enjoy the ambiance and plan on being a bit spendy., Very very expensive, but perfect for a special night out, when you want some place with atmosphere! The decor is beautiful, designed by super famous architect Tadao Ando. The food is perfectly presented. I didn try any of the appetizers, but if they are anything like the entrees, Il bet they were delicious! I always hesitant to order fish when I go out to restaurants, because in my opinion, its so easy to screw up. They can come out too dry, too crunchy, too flavorless. But Morimoto made it perfectly juicy and tender. The flavors were really good. The cod is probably the best. I usually not a citrus person when it comes to desserts, but the elderberry creme brulee was absolutely to die for. It had citrus accents, but the flavors blended so well together, oh my god... And you have to try out the bathrooms! They have Japanese toilets -- heated toilet seats... and more!, Overall the decor here is amazing, especially the bathrooms. The $5,000 toilet which squirts you every which way and was even accompanied with a drier. The food, I would say is overpriced. We had some kind of tuna pizza which was very average which our waiter recommended. The Toro tuna appetizer was amazing though. The presentation was spectacular. The tuna was in a little box turned on the side and you dipped it in 5 different types of sauces. Very tasty. We ordere a bottle of Sake which was nice and there was nothing on the menu less then $80 a bottle! I ordered a $100 bottle because I wanted something good. It was very nice but not worth the $100. We then had all different types of sushi which was recommended from the Sushi chef there. The Salmon we ordered was a little chewy. A few types of fish were good but not extravagant. They charge you by piece not by 2 per order so it adds up quickly. He made us some type of japanese mushroom which was really tasty. We had the o-toro which was nice but nothing better then what I can get in San Francisco at my favorite places. Overall$300 for 2 people is definitely overpriced. Youre paying for the decor here rather then the food., Lots of great reviews on the restaurant by others, here in Yelp-land. I am rating this solely for the bar downstairs in this review.... The Morimoto bar/lounge is one of my favorites in the city after only one visit. Absolutely stellar, stellar cocktails. One of my favorite cocktail ingredients is ginger and I will always sample one if its on the list. Sadly, I dont remember the name (I will update this review next time I go) but Morimoto has the best ginger cocktail in this city that Ive found. It was basically a concotion with a little juice, lots of alcohol and lots of ginger but the overall result is delicious and balanced. The feel at the bar BEFORE dinner, is very cool.. quiet, chic and not overdone. I saw Bobby Flay eating his dinner and drinking cocktails at the bar after I was finished with dinner and visiting that jaw-dropping ladies room. Its always good when chefs like the mixologist below the kitchen too., dont believe the hype! though the atmosphere is undoubtedly amazing (all white interior flanked by a huge glass water bottle structure in the middle) and the bathrooms are crazy/sexy/cool, i was disappointed by the main entrees. my boyfriend got the seafood boulabaisse and it was just too salty. my friends boyfriend got a tiny filet of seabass in a giant plate which did not satisfy him. i got the famous miso black cod which frankly i wasnt impressed with - i think i could have made it myself!!! the only interesting and filling dish was my other friends main entree - duck duck duck. but the drinks are delish (the lemony White Lily) as were the appetizers...we loved the spicy king crab and the kobe beef sashimi - YUM! i think we were just expecting a whole lot more...and although we were discouraged after the main entrees i still decided to order dessert - the earl grey tea creme brulee ended up being amazing! lucky for morimoto the drinks, appetizers and amazing desserts made up for sub-par main entrees. also - beware of your bill. it can get pricey if youre not watching!, More like 4.5 stars. Amazingly fresh fish, in an exquisitely designed, bright, airy oasis of light, flowing fabrics, and water bottles (yes, water bottles, but the effect is tremendous), within the Meatpacking District. Start with the Miso soup, probably the best Miso Ie ever had. Go for any Kobe beef dish, its genuine Kobe. Toro tartare and assorted nigiri gave delightful pause., The food was great. A little flirting with the sushi chef, got me the in on what was really fresh. I got some Otoro -- fatty tuna. Oh my it was heaven. I actually had some for dessert. Yeah! The drinks were quite awesome too., I must admit up-front this review is only based on a couple of drinks that we had at Morimoto but I do want to return for a meal. The space that Tadao Ando has designed is industrial and filled with light. The restaurant is minimalist with an airy feel. Definitely check out the bathrooms as they are gorgeous! The bar is a clear plastic with leaves embedded in them that gives a real depth to the the surface. We would have stayed if our vodka-sodas didnt cost $16/glass. All the dishes that were swept by us not only looked great made me salivate even though I had just finished dinner. Im definitely looking forward to my return for food. I gave it 4-stars because the Iron Chef himself was at the top of the stairs when we were leaving. He thanked us for visiting. It was a great way to start off the night., What could possibly be wrong with a combination of beautiful food and beautiful people? Sure, you have to pay through your nose for the Omakase dinner, but then you can see the Iron Chef and dine in an elegantly designed setting.I enjoyed the Rock Shrimp Tempura - the serving was huge, but I was slightly more partial towards the fried shrimp in Wasabi aioli over the shrimp in Korean red pepper sauce. Even the entree, Angry chicken was substantial and had a fiery touch to it. Well recommended for those not trying Sushi. (I decided to defer Sushi for another opportunity).The main reason for going to Morimoto was to see if the accolade of best new dessert in the city was well deserved. If I were finicky (and I am) the Tofu cheesecake was excellent, but mainly a result of the contrasting flavors of the accompaniments. I alternated a long while between portion combinations and decided that the best one was to have the chiffon like cheesecake with the candied ginger (to give it bite) and then follow it with the dipping sauce (maple syrup with coffee). Simply Amazing! (Mind you, the thin chocolate shavings on top of the white chiffon didnt add anything to the flavor)Also endearing was the Chocolate Hazelnut cake dessert with excellent texture variations between wafer and mousse. My companion couldnt say much for the green apple sorbet which she thought was too tart, but I loved it. Kudos!, Interested in taking out a second mortgage so you can hang out with wannabe hipsters eating mediocre Japanese fusion food? Then Morimoto is the place for you. This place joins the long list of overhyped event restaurants where a celebrity chef with a good interior decorator hopes he can distract you into paying a lot of money for uninspiring, or just plain weird, food. If youe looking for great sushi at around the same price, try Jewel Bako, where the focus is on delivering top quality food and service, not on showcasing all the beautiful people. We started off with rock shrimp tempura, which tasted like Red Lobster popcorn shrimp special, doused in two high MSG sauces and served with blue cheese dressing. Revolting. And Red Lobster at least has the dignity to charge a third less and give you all you can eat. Then off to the chef signature chicken Ramen, which was strangely reminiscent of Cup o Noodles - high in salty broth and tasteless, skinny noodles, low in flavor. Try Menchanko-Tei uptown or Momofuku in the East Village instead if you like Ramen. We finished our experience with the sushi and sashimi platters, which included thick slabs of above average quality fish, with a heavy emphasis on clam and salmon (and a few choice pieces of chu-toro thrown in for good measure). The sushi at Jewel Bako and Hatsuhana is much better, without the distracting disco atmosphere.I suspect this place will survive, although there are skeptics, but its clientele will be increasingly dominated by wannabe hipsters coming here by way of a bridge or tunnel (a group well represented on the Saturday I went)., Morimoto definitely doesnt disappoint its ephemeral new spot in the meatpacking district title, with its multi-floored, spacious design. We took off our shoes and sat on the floor, which was a bit odd considering the layout; the tiny waitress towered above us when serving our food and drinks.Oh right, the food. Since it was our first time there, we decided to go with the Omakase - where you pay a set price, and the chef customizes a tasting menu to, well, his choice. We had the minimum, which was $200 each. Out of *pure* curiosity we asked about the maximum - the chef told us there isnt a set maximum, although the highest hes seen during the few months theyve been open was $1000 a person. I think thats insane, even by New York standards. I think we had 10 courses. I lost count. I just know that each course was amazing. A few stood out in my mind:1. One plate was all sashimi - ive never had such fresh fish. Whats more, youre given a wasabi root and a file so you can make your own wasabi. super cool.2. rare mushroom soup - these mushrooms are shipped every few days from a part of Japan. it is cooked in this soup inside a small teapot; youo pour the soup into a cup to drink, and then eat the mushroom from the teapot. Overall - great experience. The waitress told me I was the first girl to finish all 10 courses. heck yea!, i had dinner at morimoto on tuesday night with the boyfriend. ive been to the one in philly several times(i used to work there) so naturally i wanted to check out the new york location. we got great seats at the sushi bar and started off with the kobe beef carpaccio. i was tempted to push the boyfriend off his seat so i could eat the whole thing myself. i kid. the beef practically melts in your mouth, so can you really blame me?next came the toro tartare. pretty presentation, but it was a bit of a pain in the ass to eat. still tasted very good.foie gras chawan mushi (duck breast shabu-shabu, fresh wasabi, sweet soy sauce) came out just as we finished our toro tartare. the boyfriends not too crazy about foie gras, so i got to eat most of it myself. the contrast in texture of the duck breast and foie gras made it that much more enjoyable to eat. its cruel irony, but still very good.the sea bass was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of seasoning. i hate when restaurants cover fish with sauce. that tells me the fish isnt fresh and/or the chef doesnt know how to use natural flavors to complement each other. our last course was sushi. i wanted to cry when i tasted the oh-toro. so fresh, so buttery, fantastic. then i got excited when i had the ikura - i love how the eggs burst in my mouth, releasing a light briny taste. and of course, it was very fresh.i was planning on ordering dessert, but i didnt have any more room so i had another sake martini instead. theres always room for another drink. heh. i love that theyre garnished with cucumbers because they absorb the alcohol and its like a fun little prize you find after the drink is finished.morimoto is expensive, but its worth every single penny and i will definitely be back.|0
6|nobu-new-york|Everything you heard about the place is true. Tantalizing, inventive sushi. Understated yet fresh decor. The long waiting list. The clamoring celebrities. The legend of a man. In short, a hard-core New York socialite haven. Jeremy gave me the Nobu Cookbook which soothes me during the long winter evenings in Boston with promises of fresh octupi salads and paper-thin slices of bass drizzled with hot truffle oil... Excuse me, I need to go look at it again, right now., This in-spot is another place on my over-rated list. Good sushi and vibe, but whats all the hype about? Although some people complain about this, I never find it hard to get a reservation. My only must try dish that is not always talked about (like the miso black cod is) is the shrimp tempura. Go for the spicy sauce instead of the yuzu! myriadrestaurantgroup.co206, I managed to luck into a Restaurant Week reservation here a year or two ago. Ive never had a piece of fish with a flavor or texture that even approached the amazing fillet I had that afternoon., Its mostly hype - yes, their sushi is amazingly fresh (but there are other places in the city who have just as good fish) and their cooked entrees are yummy - but between trying to get a reservation and the price, I would go elsewhere. Everyone should try it once, but then move on and try all the other great Japanese restaurants in the city., Not terribly traditional sushi but amazingly innovative and irresistible. The food, atmosphere, and energy are tremendous. I did kind of feel like I was in a private club where one might hear Pizzicato 5 or even something a bit mellower, but it didnt feel too cavernous nor was it too loud.We were with a dear friend who frequents Nobu so he did most of the ordering; I just insisted on a few items like sashimi and miso cod. We had some of Matsuhisas signature dishes as well as A LOT of sushi (both nigiri and rolls). I loved his paper-thin sashimi; its smooth and melts in your mouth. The perennial blackened miso cod, which is now replicated in many Japanese establishments, was superb and a nice balance of sweet & salty. I could talk about how good everything tasted, but I was most impressed with the freshness of all his dishes. Fish was not the least bit spongy; it was firm and flaky when it needed to be. It didnt taste like its been in the freezer for months. It was cool, not warm or ice cold, which sometimes alters the flavor. Im big into FRESH, so was quite pleased that all his food fit into that category. And for that as well as the cool ambiance, I love this place., A friend of mine managed to somehow get a reservation here and I honestly didnt think it was that great. Dont get me wrong, the food is by no means bad. But with all the hype surrounding this place I was expecting something extraordinary. The sushi was at the same level as many cheaper restaurants ive eaten at. Perhaps I went into this restaurant expecting too much, but I was a bit disappointed., In 1994, in partnership with restaurateur Drew Nieporent and actor Robert De Niro, the owners of Tribeca Grill, Nobu opened this much-hyped and highly-acclaimed lower Manhattan dining spot, where he combines his classical culinary training in Tokyo with his life in Peru and Argentina to create Japanese cuisine with a South American twist. Theres no denying that the space, with its natural textures, birch trees, wood floors, and a wall made of river stones, is stunning, but clearly the many accolades bestowed upon the menu over the years are from those who are sushi aficionados. I was unimpressed by the hot entrees - a salmon filet in teriyaki sauce was surprisingly bland and overcooked, and its replacement, while not as dry, was still flavorless, and scallops in a spicy garlic sauce were tough, with little spice or garlic evident in the dish. It may have five-star decor, but one-star service (without tasting it, of course, the waiter argued that the salmon was perfect, and clearly was miffed when we insisted on a new piece) and a two-star meal add up to a major disappointment which, at these high prices, is inexcusable., FANTASTIC SUSHI...but wait youre a vegan...what are you doing eating at this joint? ...Well the first time I ate at Next Door Nobu was in my Pre-Vegan (2004) days, NDN is the sibling restaurant of the world renowned NOBU, which is...as you guessed it...next door. The sushi was delicious, melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Our server was fabulous, she helped us pick out an assortment of the tastiest morsels on the menu. Nobu has a great assortment of sakes that are made exclusively for them by Hokusetsu. The sakes are served in single, small, large or bamboo sizes. The bamboo size is the most fun as its served in a hollowed out bamboo shoot and served in bamboo cups, very cool. The higher end Nobu sake didnt have much flavor so we resorted to the lower end sake for the second bamboo around...and that had the perfect kick to it! The beauty of Next Door Nobu is that they dont take reservations (except for large parties) so there should always be a table available, but do expect a wait unless you eat at the sushi bar.The second time I ate at Next Door Nobu was as a vegan (10/05)...and surprisingly enough there were plenty of dishes for me to eat! Most were creations off the menu...just let the waitstaff know that you are vegan and they will suggest a handful of selections to choose from. The most decadent item that I ordered on the menu was avocado tempura...oh my gawd...if you love avocadoes THIS is a dream come true. Oh the price...right...well...its expensive...but it is definitely well worth it...sometimes we just have to spoil ourselves, dont you think?, Service: A- Food: A+ Decor: B- Dessert: A+ Nobu is the best Japanese restaurant. Period. If you are to visit Nobu, lunch time would be the best bet as dinner reservation would take 1 month+. When you are to visit Nobu, you should be adventurous and focus on Chefs specialties because teriyaki dishes, fresh sushi and sashimi can be found else where. Tuna Tataki: Average dish. Simply forgettable. Squid pasta: Extremely tender squid with light sauce. Good choice of vegetable to accompany the squid texture Rock shrimp tempura: One of the highlighted dishes and is perfect with the spicy sauce. Broiled black cod with miso: My personal favorite. Subtly marinated with miso and had light sweet taste. Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno: Creative dish that actually works Bento box (warm chocolate cake with green tea ice cream): Average cake but the pairing with slightly bitter green tea ice cream to counter the sweetness of the cake is well thought. Apple spring rolls: Very refreshing but I question the pairing with the accompanying ginger ice cream. The mixed drinks are expensive but very worth it. (We tried the lychee martini and mango martini) Overall, you will get what you pay for. The dishes are very creative and delicious., sushi... eh? its not all about the sushi its all about COD nowadays at the top Japanese places. Now i do find this place a little overrated also, its more about status then food.... beside that the sushi was very fresh, make sure to go with a company expense account =), Best meal ever! I had the $45 omakase lunch this was in 2000, its gone up to $70 as of 2006, when I last ate there, and it is totally worth it! And the secret for getting in without a reservation? Show up right when they open and be a small party of 2. Theyll give you attitude, and rightly so, since the place will be full within 15 minutes, but you should get your table!My 2006 lunch omakase that I had on Dec 29:kampachi yellowjack asparagus with karai spicy sauce, basil, and yamamomo berry myrica; arbutus; mountain peachsalad of pea shoots dou miao in Mandarin, whitefish, jalapeno sauce, and ikura caviar aka salmon roe, ikra in Russianred snapper with enoki winter snow mushrooms and shiitake mushrooms, haricots vert, and tofusizzling Japanese cod with shishito mini, sweet-hot, thin-walled green peppers, cheese-encrusted asparagus, snow peas, baby carrots, sweet soy citrus sauce, and broccolimiso souptoro, king salmon, tai sea bream aka porgy, halibut, and gin saba silver mackerel sashimiyuzu a citrus fruit native to East Asia pudding cake with yogurt sauce, huckleberries, caramel nuts, and wheat cream, Nobu was one of the 3 best dining experiences Ive ever had. In my life. Period. Its the first time Ive ever experienced taste conveyed in stages. What? The best description I can give is that each item had time-released flavor. The first moment, you taste one thing, but when you breathe in or out, you get a second nuance of flavor, and then the after-taste is a third nuance of flavor. All of them delicious, by the way. Not only was it amazing for the tastebuds, but it was also intellectually stimulating. Id never really thought about food on that level until Nobu. And the fig martini haunts me to this day. WARNING: Not only one of the best meals Ive ever had, but also one of the most expensive. Make your reservation a month to the day ahead of time., Excellent food without a reservation! Show up early to avoid a wait. Entrees aimed at providing a fusion of Peruvian and Japanese influences. My wife and I have dined here twice and loved it both times. The Black Cod with Miso is wonderful! myriadrestaurantgroup.co206, The real deal, just not priced for real people. I realize Nobu no longer tops any hot list, but the food is fresh, innovative, and fun! The tasting menu is the way to go. The miso cod was the standout, and it was stellar. Oh yeah, itl cost you -- but save it for a special occasion and treat yourself. Also, expect to wait a minimum of a month for a table. So plan in advance and shoot for an off time., Ooooh, what can I write about this place that will describe exactly what it was like to eat there? Well, my hubby and I saw Nobu and recognized it from about a dozen food and wine magazines, so we decided to splurge and have a real sushi experience, NY style. As we stepped into the restaurant, I distinctly remember having this sinking feeling that I was nowhere near the level of hip-ness or cool that was required at a place like Nobu, or Next Door either. The hostess was very polite, and really, really skinny...not that that matters. She sat us at a table next to a couple of really old looking 20 year olds. They all wore too much make-up and dressed like they had just raided their mothers couture closet. As we eavesdropped on their conversation about how many calories were in a piece of raw tuna, we noted the delicious array of dishes they had in front of them. Instead of taking a risk at looking like stupid tourists, which we were, we just told the waitress to order the things we saw on the next table. We also ordered some really good sake to accompany what we suspected would be the most delicious sushi ever to grace our lips. Our food came very quickly, which was a big hint to us...obviously there was a wait for a table, and they wanted quick turnover. But they were going to have to pry our San Francisco asses out of those cushioned seats if they wanted our space. Once we started eating, we planned on staying a while. The sushi was truly spectacular. Very delicious, very chic, very elegant. The presentation was what made the dishes special...every detail was attended to with great care, down to the last sprinkling of tobiko. We ate everything in sight, including the garnish...in fact, I may have eaten something plastic by mistake. As the wait person eyeballed us at every pass to see if we were done, we stalled for as long as we could, casually ordering another plate or two as the night rolled on. We sipped our unfiltered sake sparingly, daring the Nobu staff to rush us out the door. If the owners of Nobu had planned to have a beautiful, hip, casually cool restaurant, they succeeded...but it backfired in a way, because we loved the atmosphere (and the awesome food) and didnt want to leave. After two and a half hours, we begrudgingly gave up our seats to some other silly tourists. It was a great meal, and a really enjoyable evening. The pricing was high...waaay too high for sushi. But I really didnt mind paying the ridiculous bill...I just considered it rent money for the space our butts filled during our meal., 3 cold plates + 3 hot plates + 2 sushi rolls for a party of four is enough, not 4+4+3 as suggested. That way, youll make it through dessert.These are the keywords to remember:1. Yellowtail Jalapeo 2. Cod 3. Salmon crispy spinach4. Tempura shrimpsReally cool place, kind of place you want to take visits or your boss., nice but expensive. try their chef sampler thing. everyone at the table has to get it. bacically the chef prepares whatever he feels like, but dont worry, you wont be disappointed. its basically a bunch of tapas but with a creative flare. there are plenty of these types of places, but this one takes the cake for being the most expensive and creative., Quite possibly the best food I have ever eaten. What else can you say about a truely sublime culinary experience. Casual, and flawless food and fairly decent service. When I die from butter poisoning from my indulgent tastes, I want to go face down in the broiled Miso cod., Nobu? More like Yes-Bu! Ha! Hahahahahahaha. Ha. Huh. Eh. One of my friends had reservations here (you need to make them well in advance) and she was kind enough to bring me along. The food here was so good that I felt unworthy. Everything they served --- seared tuna, salmon sushi, miso black cod (ESPECIALLY the miso black cod) --- seemed to melt in my mouth. I looked forward to every bite of it. I tried the Japanese whiskey there, too, which was as smooth as butter --- butter that makes you feel drunk. As you would expect at a higher-end restaurant, the service was excellent as well. Nobu offered not only the best meal Ive had in a long time, but an experience I will be talking about for a while., Hit the jackpot when I was able to make reservations only two weeks in advance for a lunch during Restaurant Week. Yes, Nobu during Restaurant Week! Since it was Restaurant Week, there was an amazing $20.12 prix fixe menu. My meal was an exercise in gluttony. Four of us ordered the Restaurant Week menu and then supplemented up the wazoo in addition to the menu. The menu included, among other traditional dishes like miso soup, this amazingly crazy wonderful black cod with miso. This fish was seriously to die for. In addition to this, I ordered a rock shrimp tempura, which was pretty good. The flavor wasn quite as complex as I would have expected, and lemon was pretty dominant, which I wasn expecting. Besides this, though, the meal was great. The dessert included in the Restaurant Week menu was surprisingly delicious. It was a mango and green tea layered sorbet with toasted coconut/crispy cake shavings between layers and a strawberry glaze on top. It was refreshing and wonderful. In addition to this, though, I will admit to super gluttony; I ordered a dessert on top of the included sorbet. I had the Bento Box, which was an oozing chocolate cake with green tea served in a cute little bento box. It was delectable. Overall, I say that Nobu is a close runner up after Jean-Georges and Bouley in my favorite restaurants of NY listing. Nobu was not as impressively decorated and the service was not nearly as attentive and keen as the other two, but it was a great experience, and you can beat the price we paid to have it!|0
7|peter-luger-steak-house-brooklyn|THEYVE GOT PARKING!!! Not only that, but they have large servings, its a little on the pricy side but youll love the steaks they serve. I dont think I need to provide more info, its already world renowned. But, try their burgers, its probably one of the best in NYC, Every meat eating person out there should go to Peter Luger at least once in there the life. The steaks here are truly amazing. The feel of the place is nostalgic, even if you weren around in the late 1800s when this place opened. The steak house comes with few frills, as menus are not needed (as most just order steak for 2), and guests are seated at wooden tables. People go there for the food! If your in Manhatten, it can be a bit of a treck to go out to Brooklyn with so many places in the city, but you should at least once. Note, cash only., The steak here is arguably the best in the city. Its a trek but not much of one--folks, its really JUST across the water. Try the tomato and onion appetizer as a warmup and finish with the apple strudel. SAVE ROOM, because the apple strudel is insane. Really. And it comes with some really delicious whipped cream. Also, plan on spending lots of mula because its not cheap, though you could try them for lunch. Friends of mine have been planning to come here before 3 one day to get burgers made from the aged steak meat., They stopped including this place in the ratings becuase it was first for so long. Unbelievable, unique, old fashion, fun. The menu is steak for one, steak for two, ... steak for more. the salad is a slice of tomato. This place is fantastic., If ever this was a reason to cross the Brooklyn Bridge and venture into Williamsburg, this is it. Theres nothing in the way of decor or atmosphere in what might be the most brightly lit steak house ever - an old German beer hall comes to mind - but this 115-year-old institution is heaven for carnivores. The beef is dry-aged on the premises and comes off the grill dripping with fat and butter, soft juicy pink on the inside, charred on the outside, and tender and marbled to perfection. Its the best steak in the city, and maybe the country as well. Other menu options include filet of sole and lamb chops, but why bother coming here if its not for the cow? As for the sides, the German fried potatoes are crisp and delicious, and the creamed spinach is as rich as it should be. And where else can you find an appetizer of bacon, slabs of it piled on a plate? The portions run from massive to elephantine . . . maybe its carrying the heavy plates that makes the waiters so cantankerous. Bring a bankroll, because not only is this place is very expensive, but it doesnt take credit cards., I was expecting to be let down by this place because of the hype, but left completely satisfied, five pounds heavier, and desperately in need of a long nap. Make your reservations now...the wait is 6-8 weeks. Steak for two provides more than enough meat. I wasnt crazy about the cocktail sauce-like red sauce, but the steak doesnt need it. Sides are huge, and the Holy Cow is the perfect way to finish the meal., Can you say meat! if you like meat, and even better yet, burgers, go to Luger on a weekday for lunch... thats the only time you can get one of the best burgers this city has to offer. Ive heard some not so great reviews in the past about how the burgers can be off, but when 13 of us took a holiday monday lunch break... we were ALL impresed. (image link below) static.flickr.com/21/261206, A no-frills steakhouse that opened in 1887, Peter Luger is not the place for elegant atmosphere (the dining rooms, with their exposed beams and worn wooden furniture, actually feature sawdust-covered floors) or...well, even courtesy from the wait staff. It is also the best reason to journey to Brooklyn. Menus are not provided; one diner in my party was given a withering look and told, No menu--you eat STEAK. And steak it is--hand-picked, dry-aged, butter-coated porterhouse steaks, which arrive on insanely hot platters. If you comment that the steak is too rare, the waiter will advise you to continue cooking it on the side of the platter. Starters feature amazing, thickly cut slabs of tomato covered in Peter Luger own steak sauce; creamed spinach; and double-thick bacon. Patrons really don get a choice about eating--when the spinach was served, I attempted to refuse, but was told, Spinach is good--you eat, as it hurtled down to my plate. And, dammit, it WAS good. Dessert consists of chocolate mousse pie and New York-style cheesecake, both of which come with a giant bowl of whipped cream. Along with the coffee, one of my hapless co-diners timidly asked for milk. She was given another dirty look as the waiter scooped up a huge spoonful of the whipped cream and piled it on top of her coffee. The waiter attitude was hilarious--possibly all the more funny to us because we actually think he was serious--and the food was by far the best around. Note: Peter Luger is cash only, so hit the ATM ahead of time., The 2nd best steak Ive ever had next to one I made once when i was drunk at a barbecue at my house. You cant help but feel like youve risen on the class ladder when eating here. The creamed spinach is awesome. I need to go back here but I think I need to accomplish something special in order to deserve it., Great steak and atmosphere. As a Chicago boy, I was disappointed in the size of the steak, especially as a porterhouse lover. Steak for three was more like a steak for one. I will say its not as tasty as Chicago Chop House, and of course you can beat the portions (48 oz and 64 oz porterhouses)., I heard from my friend once that she had dinner with a bunch of freakishly rich people and they paid SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS for a steak that they didnt even finish. WTF. Whatever steak they had, Im sure it wasnt even one-quarter as good as the ones from Lugers.Ive had lunch with family and friends here a couple of times and the steak was AMAZING. HUGE portions, great sauce. Hands down, one of the greatest steakhouses in NYC., The best steak Ive ever had in my life. If I tried to relatively compare other steaks Ive eaten with peter luger being on a scale of 100 (as 100) then the next best would end up at somewhere around 80. The steak at Peter Luger Steak House is mind-blowing., My dad was dying to hit this place up for his birthday. So we did it. Our vaguely Germanic waiter arrived at the table looking bored, and while asking in a droll tone if we knew what we wanted, absently moved my fathers cell phone from one side of his plate to the other. My father, smiling, looked up at him with eyebrows raised. He noticed my fathers look and said (German accent) Ya, I moved your cell phone, what are you going to do about it? Then he served us some tasty steak., The waiters here are actually very sweet, I think. The Williamsburg Bridge traffic was well worth the chance to see the unmitigated bliss on my husbands face as he bit into his blood-red t-bone. I had the filet of sole, which was delicious, as was the Caesar, German Potato Hash, and Creamed Spinach. Everything was a bit on the salty side, but if you like salt (and get them to refill your water frequently), its perfect. Dont forget, cash only!, Great steaks and the burger plate is an amazing value for lunch! The sides are amazing as well: creamed spinach, fries, tomatoes n onions.You can feel comfortable in suits or sweats. And leave room for the butter pecan ice cream with homeade whipped cream., The very BEST money could buy in the steak dinner catagory.A true win-her-over first date, business lunch/dinner, a MUST try for those who have not.Desserts that will knock you out...honestly the very best in NY/NJ, Great steak yes, but dont believe the hype. You can get the same cut of meat in a more convenient and inviting location, with a slightly broader menu and pay the same amount (WITH A CREDIT CARD) at Wolfgangs in Manhattan. Luger has become a tourist destination and as a result its tough to get a table at a decent hour - and once we were there, we were rushed through dinner and then yelled at for not using their taxi service (and paying their dispatcher extra). Still, at the end of the day, the steaks are real good and the bacon appetizer is awesome. Overrated but pretty good..., This much-hyped king of steakhouse is exactly what you expect it to be: a meat-lovers dream. The place has a classic old school boys club feel with dark wood paneling, sparse decor, and waitors in white shirts and bow ties. Beware of the onion bread and thick salty butter - it tasty, but not spectacular, and has the potential to ruin your meal - the smart ones stay away. First you have to start with the tomatoes and onions which come in 4 giant slices of fresh, cool tomatoes and onions best eaten when drenched in the sweet and tangy Peter Lugar sauce (in fact, drench everything except for the steak itself in the addictive Peter Lugar sauce) - the tomatoes are light and will offset the heaviness of all there is to come. Next, the biggest, thickest, and tastiest piece of canadian bacon comes sizzling on to your plate. It well marbled and fatty on the side and so delicious that youl want to eat more. We also ordered the much-ignored lamp chops which was smokey and flavorful - definitely not something to replace the steak or bacon, but a nice meaty addition to your meal if you can fit room in your stomach. Then the steak itself: they turn a little bread plate over as a landing strip as the waitor told me, so that the giant plate with the steak is tilted and all the juicy goodness aka fat and flavor roll down to a pool at the bottom of the platter... yumm. Peter Lugar only serves one cut: the porterhouse, which is thick, velvety filet on one side and meatier strip on the other... and it is delicious - so tender, juicy and meaty. You can order steak for twos, steak for threes, or steak for fours which differ only in size, technically, but it best to get steak of twos because they are cooked slightly better and the flavor is richer. Even the biggest eaters can get food by their eyes, get enough steak for one less than there are at your table - you won be able to finish it all without feeling like youe going to explode. The best way to eat the steak is to dip the pre-cut slices (best thing ever - there no work for you to do except to jab your fork into the meat! plus the waiters serve you EVERYthing - they told me not to touch because they can do better) into the juicy goodness before savorying the rich flavor and texture of the meat, charred to perfection on top and pink and red in the middle (depending on how you like it cooked - don order anything cooked more than medium) It really is that good. For sides, get the german potatoes, which are crisply baked potato hash, and their renknowned creamed spinach. Now I wasn the biggest fan of the spinach - too much spinach, not enough cream - but everyone else loved it so maybe it just me. Dessert was good, but nothing spectacular - though the best are the apple studel and the pecan pie - all served with a giant bowl of schlag - thick whipped cream with the texture of marshmellows. If you like whipped cream, youl love schlag. Going to Lugar is definitely something you have to experience at least once while living in New York. The steak is fantastic, even if some of the sides and the dessert could be better - but the whole gluttenous meal is like a rite of passage. When you leave, the table cloth in front of you will be stained, your stomach will be twice the size as when you came, and youl be extremely excited for your walk down to the Brooklyn Brewery to digest the food - but you won regret it... And don forget: cash only., I shouldnt be allowed to rate Peter Luger given that I only tried the vegetarian options. But here goes, based on my experience from several years ago. As my friends from business school gorged on medium-rare USDA prime beef, I tried the sliced tomato, the baked potato and eventually the apple strudel. This place has atmosphere. And my friends were happy with the food. I wanna yelp out four stars!!!!!!!, BEST PORTERHOUSE EVER. I worship this place. It lived up to its hype for me. I loved the low-key decor, fun service and excellent food. The steak was cooked to perfection, so juicy, and comes out steaming hot and still cooking so order medium rare if you want your steak medium. The sides were outstanding and the dessert was OUTRAGEOUSLY AMAZING. I dont love pecan pie and it was the best pecan pie I ever had. I want to try the brownie sundae next time. The shlag (whip cream) is really unique and so good. Remember: Cash only. And, its advised to not ask for a menu. They assume you have been there before and just know what to order which is a bit odd to me. Whatever, its the best steakhouse in NYC and maybe even the nation. Thats a toss-up with Gibsons in Chicago.|0
8|secchu-yokota-new-york|Officially open for dinner.(Found out about this place from Eater NY -- great source for infor. on new restaurants).Small restaurant with Japanese staff.8 counter seatings & two tables (w/ separate lounge menu), serving tempura omakase (only one of two in the city, along w/ Tempura Matsui).Nothing beats eating tempura prepared piece by piece. Batter for the tempura here is light & delicate, absorbing very little oil.Cost of omakase is only $65, a great value, imo. Im still pleasantly shocked at the cost of the omakase, considering the quality and the amount of food you get (I left very full.).Omakase consisted of: Amuse bouche, two starter courses (raw sweet shrimp & chicken p32t39), 10 different tempura, a main course (choice between duck soba or ochazuke), and a dessert.Menu changes daily, so you will probably see different items when you dine here.Overall, immensely enjoyed the tempura omakase here.Highest compliments to the executive chef & chef de cuisine for the wonderful dinner.Impeccable/very friendly service.Highly recommended (will be coming here often when in the mood for tempura & Japanese fusion cuisine).: 10 calendars, A welcome newcomer to East Village. Incredible value at $65 for the amount of food on the tasting menu. The tempura scallop was one of the best dishes Ive had in a while. The dining experience was made even more wonderful by the chefs and wait staff. Youll need to call ahead to make reservations, I would try to get the second seating so you can extend the meal beyond the 2 hours recommended., This place filled what NYC had been missed before... the good and affordable Tempura. They used most local ingredients to keep the cost affordable. Price for sake are very reasonable. I really hope they can survive...., This is a very enjoyable meal, and not just because of the immensely high price quality ratio. Rather, the execution is on point and there is an integrity behind the cooking. As is typical of Japanese cuisine, the quality lies in the minute details of seemingly simple cooking techniques. The differing thickness of batter coating to match the ingredients. The temperature control of the frying oil. The preservation of water content in the ingredients. All these are minute details which testify the chef mastery in his cooking. And on top of that, there is the whimsical nature of fusing Western ingredients with Japanese cooking techniques. It is hard to fathom that a chef who is classically trained in French cuisine can produce such high quality tempura which gives Tempura Matsui a run for the money. Kondo Fumio (8f187466754b), who owns the 2 Michelin star eponymous restaurant in Ginza, once said that Tempura not only is a fried food, but it is also a steamed food. And in that respect, through the lens of this meal, I can finally understand the meaning behind his words. I cannot recommend Secchu Yokota enough. A full review on each dish can be found here: higrubandgrog.com/storie206, I would bet this restaurant would be on fire pretty soon! They are a really small one, only have 8 seats, open from Monday to Saturday at dinner time only, just take two rounds of guests every night, which is 16 guests at most. All these limitations combined together make it a really enjoyable and private dining experience. Their food is awesome, really fresh and tasty. Soup, tempura and dessert, basically every bite or sip made me think about the same question: how come they can make such simple and common ingredients so impressive. The most important part is, the dinner tasting menu, which consists of 11 courses, only cost you $65! Given all the limitations mentioned above, I dont even think they can make any money out of it, lol. Anyway, 65 dollars for such an unforgettable dinner experience, WOW!, The chef use very fresh materials to cook traditional Japanese dishes.The experience is wonderful.It usually take 2 hours to enjoy the tasting dinner., This restaurant only has 8 seats and the impeccably paced full course dinner takes about 2.5 hours. I absolutely loved that part of the experience. It was very relaxed, cozy and I felt I had a very personalized experience. The entire staff was extremely professional and on-point. Attention to detail was second to none.As for the food itself, what can I say? Chef Yokota and gang are masterful at their crafts. Its obvious that deep thought went into each and every aspect of the full course dinner. Its really a work of art. Mouth watering as well. I couldnt wait to find out what was going to come out next!Well done!, I love the overall atmosphere of this place. Its small and cozy and the entire staff is extremely nice, helpful, and welcoming. Make sure you make a reservation to this place because they have limited seating (only 8 in the entire place) and its all at a counter that faces an open kitchen, which is cool, but no tables if thats what you expect. Very intimate setting.The menu is also somewhat limited as the only food they have (besides the speciality tempura on their chalkboard menu) is the omakase, which is a course meal. Youll get several rounds of appetizers, the meal, dessert. I ended up leaving the place very full, but not feeling heavy (like I hated myself for eating so much food) since a lot of it is light, but the two guys I went with said they could eat another bowl of ramen. Just keep that in mind because the omakase is pretty pricey ($65). I think for the amount of food, its a little bit on the pricier end. I also wish theyd expand their menu to add just a few more options.They do have a great sake menu and my friends and I (between us) ordered probably 5-6 different types of sake and they ALL tasted great. They were all slightly different too, which was such a great sake tasting experience.Additionally, the service was amazing. Dai-mama, our server, was so nice and helpful at explaining what it was we were consuming and was just generally really sweet. The chefs were also really nice, you can tell they put a lot of love into this place and it shows.Will definitely be back in the future.|0
9|sushi-ginza-onodera-new-york|The food is nice and deserves 3 1/2 stars and the extra 1/2 star is to reward the most Japanese service one can find in this time zone. This restaurant opened yesterday and serves two omakase menus: a regular one for $300 and a premium one for $400 including tip. We went for the premium one and were served 21 pieces of sushi and sashimi plus miso soup and dessert. The fish was all from Japan and good. The highlights of the night were:- the soy and sugar marinated octopus served with yuzukosho; it was very tender and flavourful. - tairagai, the Japanese razor clam also called pen shell clam, wrapped in seaweed. The attraction of the dish was more about texture than flavour. - the squid which was tender.- the wild cherry trout- the charred sea bass. I loved the char and savory taste. - the uni topped with charred beef and truffle. This dish was very nice but the sea urchin taste was lost in there- the uni. It was very fresh. The best with in NYC with Nakazawa. - the green tea and coconut pana cotta it was a nice mix of bitterness and slightly sweetness. The service was effective and very polite. Maybe a menu listing all the fish of the night would nicely supplement the sushi chefs explanations. The best part of service was the very Japanese goodbye by the chef and staff who bowed to us on the street., Another new sushi omakase in town. Tried their premium omakase tonight.Relatively easy to make counter seating reservation by phone for now.A treat to have Chef Yohei prepare all the dishes and sushi. He is helping out at the NYC restaurant, before he heads out to LA in August to become the head chef for the Onodera restaurant in Beverly Hills.Its expensive, but if you speak Japanese you can learn a lot from the chef about the fish, ingredients, preparation, history, source, etc. Learned from him the Edo style of preparation, use of red vinegar for the sushi rice, the huge abalone they use is very difficult to acquire, can acquire only a small piece of the cheek meat from the tuna, the uni they use is not the ones that come in a package, but they actually crack open the sea urchins themselves, the difficulty in getting the fish from Tokyo fish market to NYC, etc. When you learn about all this information from the chef, the cost of the omakase is justified, imo.In addition, I assure you that you will not find many of their unique sushi offered here in other NYC restaurants. Also, the portion size of the fish for each sushi is easily 2-3X that you find at other high-end sushi restaurants in NYC. Lastly, impecabble service. Gratuity is included.I had a good chuckle because the staff, including the chef, came outside the restaurant to say goodbye in Japanese style with the bow and all, but they basically stood there for a long time, until we were clearly out of sight, at least three blocks away. Pretty unique, especially for NYC, which is not known for politeness.This place is a gem, and I plan to come back again. : 10 calendars, Had the $300 omakase meal which includes gratuity. The presentation and quality of every course were top top notch. Each nigiri tasted very fresh and meaty. My favorites were the monkfish liver (which was very rich and reminded me of foie gras) and uni (which tasted incredibly fresh and buttery). The service was amazing and better than other high end sushi restaurants in Manhattan. We basically had our own personal sushi chef and waitress. It was such a treat to have Chef Yohei prepare our meal. He always had a smile on his face. As others have said, the chef and wait staff walk you out as you exit and gives you the warmest send off., Ive been to all the best sushi restaurants in NYC (Masa, Nobu, Blue Ribbon, Brush Stroke, Kuru, Yasuda, Hatsuhana, Sakagura, 15 East) and this is hands down the best and terms of quality of fish and service. You basically have your own sushi chef and server throughout the evening. Your 2 choices for the evening are a $300 or $400 omakase. I got the $300 but regret not getting the $400. Its that good! The quality of fish was amazing! Properly rested and the perfect temp. They also have a wide variety of sake and get to choose your own crystal glass. After youre done, your chef and server walk you out of the restaurant and send you off with a deeeeep bow. Absolutely amazing! A must try for fancy sushi lovers!, Best of the best! Staff: very very friendly and professorial Food: highest quality of the all Chef: very funny and professional Will for sure come back to visit!!! I feel like I was back in Japan while I was eating in this restaurant., The best and I have tried most high end sushi places in NYC... Im in love.....If you like sushi, this is the place to go. I wish it wasnt this expensive though so I could go every week. lol, I wish my budget allows dinner here every night. Like all the other reviews, no question the best sushi in the U.S.experienced. I mentioned to the waitress I do not eat farmed fish if that is an option not to include and she said ALL their fish is wild. The sauces, spices, marinades, and fish quality are better than any of its peers, 15 East, Ichimura, Masa (ok, maybe not the ultra premium toro as rich as foie gras thats scrapped off by a shell ), and even my used to be favorite Nakazawa. The rice is heavier on the vinegar and not as jammed packed together, , better than Tanoshis and Yasudas for my personal taste.Its the Michael Jordan of sushi, all around best., This place is simply sensational. Best sushi Ie had outside of Japan. Head chef has a relaxed and welcoming personality - making it especially enjoyable. Atmosphere is elegant, and formal, yet also relaxed and personable. Highly recommend to anyone interested in an authentic sushi experience., There is absolutely no experience that will compare to my dinner at Sushi Ginza Onodera. It was like nothing else-- personal attention from both the chef and manager... yes, they escort every patron outside to say goodbye. We ordered the Premium course, Kiwami and a bottle of saki. Before our bottle of saki was presented, we chose our own glasses from their selection. Some spotlight dishes included: cuddle fish; barracuda; uni; monk fish liver; and conch. I cannot exaggerate how fresh and delicious every course was. When asked how it was, I frequently stumble over my words because I cannot express how incredible Sushi Ginza Onodera was, so please, go and experience it for yourself., Ive dined here twice at lunch. First of all they have the best sushi rice in nyc which is most important! They use 2 red vinegars - light and thick mix - which gives the rice a nice and tangy flavor. Its my first time seeing a sushi ya in the states that uses red vinegar.. very nice. Fish are almost all wild and mostly from Japan. I liked everything about this place from gari to the shari. Nice hinoki wood counter and zen interior. I need to check the dinner course someday which is quite expensive. I will see if the price tag is worth it..but from what I hear the seafood that comes out during dinner should be worth it. Saito san is the best and quite entertaining., Came here for lunch. You have three choices, $70, $100, $130, I had $130, which include 1 appetizer, egg curd, miso soup, desert, and 15 piece of sushi. The fish piece cut is generous, so it is very filling and satisfying. I thought the fish quality was very good, and the sushi tasted very good, but not mind blowing. I guess for lunch, the fish selection wont be as superior as dinner, which makes sense, as dinner will be charged much more. I will go to try dinner and see how it goes, hope that will blow my mind away. But I have to say for $130, it is amazing deal, it is the best it can go. Especially it already includes tip.The atmosphere is great, bright, lovely, and perfect mixture of traditional sushi restaurant with modern elements. The chefs are fun, and professional, and waitress are polite and sweet. After lunch, they even walked me out of restaurant, stood outside of restaurant kindly said good bye to me and saw me walking away. Felt like to be treated as japanese royal family., Awesome! I like this restaurant. They provide very good food and service., A lit bit pricey for what was offered compared to what you can get in Japan but Onodera is one of the more authentic sushi restaurants in north america. Rice was prepared with their own recipe (no, it is not red vinegar), not exactly my favorite kind of taste, but the overall craftsmanship is better than most other US sushi places. That said, I think this is the most authentic sushi restaurant in NYC.Chef Saito was friendly, hilarious and interesting. Service from the waiting staff was impeccable, too., The fish was way cut way too big, off balance texture between under seasoned and undercooked rice and massive slice off fish.The kinmedai was cured but it tasted incredibly slimy and not fresh. Sad. The most over priced, over rated sushi in NYC. Save your money and eat at sushi Zo twice., I have been eating sushi for many years, but Ive never had real Japanese sushi. I usually get the packaged $15 sushi boxes in supermarkets or sushi rolls in common Japanese restaurants. The experience at Sushi Ginza Onodera completely changed my perspective on sushi. I can never go back to the regular stuff, and I say thats for the better!I chose the $400 dinner omakase. From start to finish, every dish was a surprise, and a work of art. The evening went on and the plates kept coming. Each plate came at the right place in the order. It was like watching a good play - full of drama. My most memorable dishes include monk fish liver, abalone, egg custard topped with caviar, chutoro and otoro tuna. They were all wonderful.When the dinner ended, I walked toward the door followed by my waitress and sushi chef. At the door outside they gave me a bow at an angle that looked too deep for comfort. As I walked away, I thought I should take a photo with the chef. I ran back while he was still there. He was more than happy to take a photo with me.The whole experience was above and beyond., To date, at least in NYC (favorite sushi bars are still in San Francisco in my opinion), I personally like Sushi Ginza Onodera better than Yasuda and Nakazawa.Sushi Ginza is very new as it opened just in May of this year. They have chefs from Japan as well as others who have worked at competing sushi bars in the city. They have only omakase-style dining here - 3 various options for lunch ($70/$100/$130) or 2 options for dinner ($300/400).I came here during lunch and still had an amazing experience that lasted almost 2 hours. From start to finish, execution and each piece was perfect in flavor, size, and appearance. There was no need for any sort of extra wasabi or soy sauce. They also use their own, freshly grated wasabi in each piece and serve your meal with house-made ginger which was the best ginger Ive tasted all year!At the end of your meal, they complete your experience with Tamago, Miso Soup, & Dessert. The miso soup was out of this world..and usually thats the last thing I remember when eating omakase. I asked what their secret was, and apparently they brew it slowly, with various dashi and 5 types of various miso.The dessert was matcha flavored yet light and refreshing.Service was outstanding- all the servers are Japanese and speak it with their clientele. But, they all speak English and I still felt well taken care of as a non-Japanese diner. Two thumbs way up and cant wait to return!, Im not sure where to start the quality of the fish was truly a notch above the most of the places with A game in NYC. Just a notch above. The service was fantastic.OK, so we did have waayyy too much Sake which is clouding my memory, but everything was fantastic fromt he marinated octopus that was smooth and soft like Fresh Mozzarella, to the O-Toro, Chu Toro, Ocean Trout, Gizzard Shad, Chawanamushi w/Caviar and Uni, it was a great journey. I had brought a close friend for his first omakase to celebrate some work accomplishments, and I secretly wanted to ruin his perspective on sushi so we would no longer have to go to the Sushi restaraunt near our NJ office anymore.... Mission accomplished.Starting out , he and I had the restaurant to ourselves. Every detail of decor is made with amazing detail, from the sushi bar wood to the glasses you choose to drink your sake out of, to the platings, and even the bathroom ( which anytime I or my companion got up to use, the waitress (?) would go into the mens room first and check to see if it was in acceptable state, my theory was that she was making sure no monsters were in there :) ) All Amazing. My only letdowns were that we were not served Prawns that seem to be a staple, and that the head chef Saito was not out at the bar once service began, but I am sure he had a hand in what we were served. Additionally I did not see the samurai swords so prevalent in the other yelp pics, but nonetheless.. regardless of price , this was an A+ meal. I look forward to coming back for lunch and seeing the team. My mate was also very shocked at the goodbyes we received from the staff and the chef outside on 5th Avenue. Polished execution if you can afford it, and you love Omakase, you need to eat here at least once., A complete multi-sensory experience. The food, the service and Chef Saito himself truly defined fine dining; whilst they gave you the feeling of being at home. Jokes were exchanged, sak38 was poured and laughter resonated across the room. I think I died in an accident, cuz this must be heaven., The food was beyond fresh and delicious. The staff super friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and warm. What an unforgettable experience! If you appreciate tasting menus and can afford the extraordinary prices then this is a must!, Omakase only but Omakase at its finest. The fish amazingly fresh and superbly prepared. I have a crustacean allergy and the chef cooked around it still made for a amazing lunch experience. The service was outstanding they explained that was served and were super attentive. I would recommend this place to any sushi lover. I will be back. This is a non tipping restaurant which I prefer when the food and service are this good.|0
10|sushi-yasuda-new-york|For a sushi restaurant with a common Japanese name, it serves the largest variety of interesting fish at its freshest. Where else can you taste the difference among multiple types with varying degrees of freshness for the same fish and find names on the menu that youve never heard of? Learn how sweet anago and rich unagi kuro is compared to the usual fare from China with preservatives served at most restaurants. Peak your sushi experience by tasting of the flavors of the ocean with uni from California, Peace Passage oyster, and orange clam himo. Other highlights include the sardines, a variety of yellow tails and mackerel, and giant clam (mirugai). You will barely touch your soy sauce because its brushed on for you to grab with your hands, which is how sushi should be enjoyed. End your sushi experience with tamago chilled to dessert perfection with the sweet feeling of eating ice cream.Unfortunately, I was disappointed that the fragrant smells of the hondashi in the chawanmushi were not carried over to my taste buds with a flavorful custard treat. The toro and butterfish were overrated compared to the other fish. Moreover, the sushi chefs seem to be friendly to gals, but reserved when serving sushi connoisseurs or non-Japanese guys, who speak their language., Sushi Yasuda has been called a temple of sushi, and it deserves the title. Simple and spartan, both in decor and fare, you arent going to find humongous rolls drenched in sauces. Rather, the sushi is presented and prepared in reverence and understated simplicity. Often when I go, I sit at the counter and avail myself to the sushi chef to select the best path for me. His selections have never led me astray. In a city where restaurants scream for attention, Sushi Yasuda simply sits and waits. There is no need to shout. The acolytes know their master well. Be warned, the price for worship is high, come with a well-padded wallet. Dont sully the experience by worrying (too much) about such insignificant material matters as the looming bill. sushiyasuda.com, Ill be burned at the stake for this review. I went to Sushi Yasuda once, many moons ago. I didnt sit at the bar. We did not have the omakase. We ordered a la carte, and I did enjoy the meal. But what I remember most was the eel bone crackers. I recall eating a large variety of unique fish I had never had before, but I cannot remember any of them. My friends have better recollections than I. eGulleters rave about this place. For me, Id go back for the eel bone crackers because its all I can remember. Why dont more restaurants serve them?! Besides that, the service was impeccable. You feel like youre in another world. Some folks rail against monstrous sized portions, but every time I try to recall of the portions of sashimi I envision my thumbnail. Okay, so maybe every selection was ... three thumbnails, but when I can barely remember what I ate, Ive got a problem., Couldnt decide what to get so I asked the waiter to just make it up! Every piece is served with the perfect balance of shoyu and wasabi so save your barbarous mixing and dipping nonsense. Put it in your mouth and the sushi literally melts in your mouth. Like BUTTAH, my friends. Havent had it this good since a 5 AM sushi throwdown at the Tsukiji Fish Market in Japan back in 2000!, The sushi here is beyond words wonderful. It is so fresh, I swear all of the fish must have been swimming scant hours before the meal. I had a variety of sushi, including a tuna roll, egg sushi, tuna sushi, squid, and (drumroll) cherrystone clam. I was very excited to try a new sushi, and the clam was very good. I love the texture of clam and the taste is not offensive like oysters. (No offense to oyster lovers out there.) What I was disappointed about this time, though, was the service. It seemed like they wanted to hurry us out of there! Granted, at the time of making the reservation, they mentioned something vague about having something going on where we would need to finish by 1:30, but clearing up quickly and telling us they had run out (or didnt have in the first place?) any of the listed desserts was ridiculous! Anyway, the sushi was fabulous, so we left content. Id been here a few times before and truly enjoyed every aspect of the experience, so Im dismissing this one service disappointment as a one-off because they were wonderful the previous times I was here., This is sushi heaven. I savor every bite of sushi at Yasuda. Its such a treat to eat here, esp if youre sitting at the sushi bar and ordering omakase... I guarantee that you wont be disappointed and will be looking forward to the next meal here. Theres nothing in particular I would recommend since EVERYTHING is delicious (toro, arctic char, salmon, scallop, giant clam, sea eel, freshwater eel, ikura, etc...). The sashimi is served with sea salt on the side (which is the best salt Ive ever had... had no idea there were differences in salt taste?!?); many of the sushi pieces (perfect bite size morsels with just the perfect combo of fish and rice) are brushed lightly with shoyu with a squeeze of lemon. Stuff just melts in your mouth! Though I love getting the omakase, its hard to stop yourself and just keep going & going & going... its hard to put a stop to something this good no matter how full you are! The service is impeccable and the simple interior decor is clean, modern, and almost stark. But the focus here is on the food so I wont even bother with anything else. In my book, Sushi Yasuda is probably one of the top 3 sushi places in the country. It definitely comes at a price but its definitely worth the splurge., Sushi lovers if you cant get a table at Nobu then forget about it and try Sushi Yasuda! Fresh fish and delicious food. I highly recommend the white salmon sushi and any of the special daily appetizers. Also, the $20.50 pre-fixe dinner is a great deal. It includes a combo of sushi, sashimi and rolls., Sushi Yasuda was a religious experience for me. I had been wanting to go for 4 months (I work near by) and when I finally did I had insanely high expectations. For myself, the visit was a pilgrimage to sushi-mecca. The experience was absolutely amazing. I found peace with the world around me: no wants, no desire, no anger, no frustration just simple, buttery, delicious fish. Okay, maybe a little desire and want, but only for more fish.The fatty tuna is the best single bite of food Ive ever had. Thats no hyperbole. The freshwater white eel served with salt and lemons is warm and wonderful. The flash fried crab is succulent. The Asahii draft is cold and perfect. The atmosphere is simple and elegant: bamboo floor, walls and ceilings with almost no other decorations. The waiter was kind and attentive. Overall the experience surpassed my expectations with delicious flying fish colors. The only down side is the insane bill you wind up dealing with when you leave, but dont let that bother you, think of it as donations to the greatest religion in the world: sushism., I do not like reviewing a sushi place until I have been there at least 3 times. I am damn picky about sushi but since I dont live here I will go ahead.Anyway, I had extremely high expectations for this place after getting recommendations and reading rave reviews from just about everyone I asked. I ordered everything a la carte. All of the sushi was extremely fresh and presented beautifully. I like the extra touch of a finger towel given to you for the nigiri. I have been told nigiri is meant to be eaten with your fingers, sashimi with chopsticks. The use of real wasabi is always appreciated.The only issue, or perhaps question, I had with the nigiri is why did he put salt on all of the clam and scallop pieces? Perhaps this is the way they are meant to be eaten? Well maybe, but it detracted away from the flavor. I might need to be reeducated.Anyway, I will definitely return the next time I am in NYC. All of the nigiri I had was delicious and to numerous to name.Update review coming in the future, Im expecting the fifth star will be added., Is Sushi Yasuda a religious experience? No; for a religious experience, try sashimi in tsujiki market. Sushi Yasuda nevertheless serves the best sushi in the city. The restaurant itself is a practice of minimalism; in this bamboo box, your senses can concentrate on the nigiri and sashimi. Unlike Sushi of Gari and Sushi Seki, enough space between tables allows you to enjoy a brief respite from the bustle of midtown. And the food: the first bite will unleash your innter gastronome; indeed, savor the hedonistic time, as it ends all too quickly when the bill arrives., Sushi Yasuda has the best salmon and fatty tuna(toro) Ive tasted in America. Pretty close to the sushi in Tokyo. I tried the Omasake menu before, good but nothing to write yelp about it. I recommend just to stick with the sushi. Very fresh and very satisfying., First of, I cant thank the other reviewers enough for the positive and informative reviews. I come through Manhattan for work, and often do not give a lot of thought to wheres dinner going to be. Yasuda was an absolutely amazing sushi experience. Before this meal, the best sushi I had was in Maui and at Heat, in Chicago. Not only does Yasuda rank high on the list for quality of the food, but the service was first rate. I was dining at the bar and had an amazing chef who not only was a master with his culinary skills, but made me laugh for the entire time I was there.An extremely well-run sushi dining experience - hope you enjoy it as much as I did!, The variety of fish is only part of the attraction at this fine establishment. Service is impeccable to a fault (literally) - fresh hot towels, quicker than a blink-of-the-eye style of service and the waitress comes and wipes the table with the tip of a washcloth every time you might dare leave a drop or so of soy sauce on the sushi bar table. The last part was definitely overkill (I wanted to call the waitress mommy and also have her wipe away any other transgression of etiquette I might have committed), but other than that we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and skill of the sushi chefs. Some examples of the different types of fish that were available on the day were: - Skip Jack (tuna) - Fluke (yum) - Striped Bass - Porgy - Ainame - King Salmon - White King Salmon - Sockeye Salmon (another recommendation) - Sanma - Spanish Mackerel - Pompano - Butter Fish I thoroughly enjoyed the kuchiko (sea scallop guts!) and the shirayaki (white freshwater eel) was just a complete melt-in-your-mouth experience. The soft shell crab appetizer was amazing because I have never seen a soft shell crab with so much meat (I unfortunately more familiar with those fried up tiny wizened ones). If it is more to your taste, traditional sushi is also available, except I somehow doubt they do California rolls...:), Ok, the chef here was too much!! We got the total lecture on how this was real sushi and not fake sushi and ergo no rolls that you find at other places. It was good, don get me wrong but sheesh a little less ude dude! We actually got in late and they closed shop early. We then went to McD and got burgers. We were still hungry!, They rush you a bit sometimes, but this is the real thing. I lived in Tokyo for 3 years and this is as good as any sushi-ya I tried in Japan., Stop reading this, and go to sushi yasuda NOW!! This place is beautiful inside because it is made completely of bamboo. I love to sit at the sushi bar and order directly to the chefs. The toro is like butter. I tried sea urchin here and it was delicious. My favorite sushi spot in all of NYC., The approach here is pretty straight forward:1. Request a seat at the bar (preferably with Yasuda-san, but I doubt you can go wrong with any of the itamae)2. Omakase (its tempting to try kitchen specials, but go for them some other time)3. Hold on for a wild nigiri ride! (youll do just fine without maki or sashimi, trust me)If you do happen to sit in front of Yasuda-san, he comes across as a very jovial and passionate guy. Hes more than happy to talk about not only what youre eating, but where it came from and why hes chosen it for your meal, all while executing knife strokes that are an attraction in and of itself. And he does this without being overbearing or making you feel like youre in some kind of sushi lecture hall.The bottom line is that its excellent Tokyo-style sushi. Its easy to take this particular style of sushi for granted, especially given the strong influence of Nobuyuki Matsuhisa (Nobu) in the US sushi scene. However, Yasuda-san proves that genius can be found in simplicity., Mmmm.... Yasuda. Ive been to Yasuda three times, and without a doubt the best way to go is to sit at the sushi bar and order the omakase. You wont be served a piece of fish that isnt a little piece of perfection. You might be tempted by some of the small hot dishes, but youre better off with the raw fish at Yasuda. Plus, Yasuda offers a few little dishes on the house which seem to arrive at just the right time., For sashimi, I would go to Tomoe or Blue Ribbon, BUT For sushi that will fill your soul and put tears in your eyes, Sushi Yasuda is the ONLY place for me. For the best experience, make a reservation to sit at the sushi bar where and when Master Yasuda will be serving. Do not ask for sashimi or your typical California rolls or such as his specialty is sushi and only sushi. Master Yasuda will ask you what you like and dislike the most and he will recommend certain selections based on that.His soy sauce and wasabe are home made. He will inform you which pieces you should and shouldnt use with soy sauce.I have been there twice and both times I have been very pleased.Go with the flow and you will have an enchanting experience. Definitely not a place for bargain hunters. The restaurants ambience is chic and trendy with a sense of serenity.If you are a sushi and sashimi purist and hate eating sushi and sashimi at so-called (Chinese or Korean owned) Japanese restaurants then this is the place for you., Overrated and pricey, the Zagat hyped Sushi Yasuda serves tiny sushi that is composed of thinly sliced fish glued to the rice by overly large portion of wasabi. Perhaps I just can quite appreciate what makes this restaurant unique, its wide selection of domestic fish and its specially prepared domestically grown sushi rice. Obviously not serving to the Japanese clientele, the English only menus are confusing (main menu, sushi a la carte menu, special set sushi menus with pencil marks everywhere) and do not offer any guide to their proud selection of non-traditional domestic fish. Don expect much help from the waitress as she would only point to the red pen circled today recommendation from the a la carte menu and in my case, she provided the wrong information about the ingredients included in the chirashi. The fish is indeed very fresh (as you would expect from any restaurant charging this price) and selection unlike any I had before. However, I agree with Larry that none of these special sushi were memorable. As for the Yasuda scientifically precisely prepared sushi rice, it decent but not as impressive as the restaurant has claimed.Warning, stay away from the miso soup. For $6, I expected the soup base to be made from exquisite dashi and of decent portion. Instead, the only ingredient worth mentioning was the few tiny pieces of nameko mushrooms and the soup was served in a tiny chawanmushi sized cup.Yasuda decor is clean, nontraditional and upscale and its atmosphere business like. The chef and staff is another very distinct characteristic of Sushi Yasuda as some of its Maitre D and sushi chefs somehow slightly resemble the yakuza (dress code, hair style, attitude, choice of words, etc.) which certainly makes an awkward but interesting dining experience. Overall, my recommendation is, if you are willing to pay this price for sushi and looking for upscale service, go to Ichimura or Sushiden.|0
11|the-river-caf%C3%A9-brooklyn|Ok...where to start...OK, yes..this place is PRICEY but a wonderful night out. romantic dinner, marriage proposal and impressive business dinner type of establishment..the staff is PROFESSIONAL, the scene is PHENOMENAL and the food GOURMET, Elegance times 10. Great way to impress out of towners (especially those rich relatives who wanted to take you to a nice dinner). Service is white gloved, top of the line, attentive without being pushy. Well prepared cocktails, excellent wine list, food is expertly and loving prepared and presented. And the view....well...its New York City at the tip of your fingers. What more could you ask for (well...maybe a few more rich relatives....if anyone has some they could lone me id appreciate it). Or you could do what my friends and I do and wait for Restaurant week when they offer a 3 course lunch for around $20. Now thats a good deal!!!, I hosted a bachelorette weekend in NYC years ago for my best friend and 10 of us dined here to cap off the weekend. It was scary expensive but quite literally the best dining experience Ive ever had. From the seamless service to the beautiful plating and delicious food...it was seriously perfect. I would take a bite of my lovely warm roll and the next time I would look down there was a new lovely warm roll...what the? I thought I was going crazy but they are like The Flash...the only evidence of their presence being a shiny new fork or a new tray of butter. The view is stunning. The whole meal feels like you are on a cloud somewhere. I havent been back but this would be a wonderful romantic dinner for a special occassion (one wonders how many rings have been hidden in cakes and puddings there) but it would be a great place to take visiting parents who get a beautiful NYC experience...(and hopefully pick up the tab). It is a prix fixe so at least you know the damage right off the bat. The dessert that is a chocolate Brooklyn Bridge is a nice touch. A must NY dining experience. Save your pennies., My parents did not buy me battery-powered toys when I was a kid. My brothers and I played with Lego and Lincoln Logs and saying I bored prompted the injunction to Go read a book. No surprise that when I had playdates at other kidshouses the only thing I wanted to do was play Hungry Hungry Hippos, Operation, or Sega. (No surprise either that I now make software for kids.) The worst--and most common--response to my wanting to play these games was the friend saying, in a totally bored voice, Oh, the batteries are dead or We lost the body parts. That sort of disappointment is about what I felt while dining at the River Cafe. Granted, the view is amazing and you feel like youe on a big fancy boat, but in my opinion the hype about the food is complete misguided. What really gets me is that the pre-appetizer compliments of the chef, a doll-sized teacup of lobster bisque, was awesome. It made me think I was at the right restaurant, watching the sunset beyond the Manhattan skyline, peering at the Statue of Liberty in the distance, having a romantic dinner blah blah blah. The bread, too, was great--I had three fennel-raisin rolls; when the waiter came around the fourth time, I almost expected him to suggest that I cut down on carbs. All in all I guess we got off to a good start: my dirty martini was smooth and had the perfect amount of olive juice. My boyfriend and I shared two appetizers, a tuna tartare and some foie gras plate. The latter was way too sweet (think foie gras with Welch grape jelly). And ever had raw tuna? Well yeah, then youe had this dish. Our main courses were some kind of duck--a little overcooked even though we asked for it underdone--and sea bass or one of those white fishes that are sometimes light and melty in your mouth and sometimes dry and cafeteria-like (you guess how this one was prepared). I am a fairly critical person, but I was dying to like this place--the waitstaff was friendly and the venue was beautiful and, let face it, everyone wants to love restaurants in Brooklyn. But all the food we were actually paying for--and when I say paying I mean really racking up the airmiles on my credit card--was mediocre. Even the desserts! I mean, how hard is it to make chocolate into something delicious? Ie had better desserts at McDonald. The point is, the River Cafe is a lovely place for a drink , especially if you can rope one of the waiters into giving you free bread. For dinner, though, you be better off packing a turkey sandwich and having a picnic on the Brooklyn Bridge., River Cafe is FANTASTIC! The service is absolutely amazing. I went there for restaurant week and the service and food were fantastic. The food is so flavorfull and the wine list is excuisite. They have a very sweet German Reisling that went perfectly with our food. I would def recommend it., The prices are high, the portions are small but the view is unbelievable. If you got some money to burn dont miss this place., We have been going to the River Cafe for many years, you can count on the view the service and the food BUT you cant count on the crowd. The last time I was there there were 2 high priced escorts with business men and a table full of tourists with shorts (it was lunch) but still who wants to sit with all this at these prices?!, to be fair, ive only been able to eat here when my boss has taken the company out for our holiday party, and i know the bill was extremely high. but, we had our holiday party at this restaurant two years in a row and both times it was absolutely delicious. the menu always changes, but there was not a disappointing moment in the entire three course meal. if you (or someone you know) can afford it, its worth it. plus the view is amazing -- try going for a late lunch so you can see the sunset behind the statue of liberty., Tremendous place and a New York institution. The view is fantastic, the atmosphere and service are impeccable, and the food is stellar. Excellent seafood with waiters that know how to give legitimate and objective opinions and a wine pairing or two. The brunch is great - perfect for a (pre-planned and reservations-secured) weekend meal, particularly before a museum or theatre visit perhaps. The dinner is equally impressive, arguably more so, and the view of the water and Manhattan is really breathtaking. A lot of fun and absolutely worth shelling out for if you want to really enjoy an inimitable piece of the NYC restaurant scene., I came here for lunch over the memorial day weekend with my mother and the views, food, and drinks were so good ! We were a smidge late because of the lovely subway, so we had to wait about 10 minutes while they cleared a table for us -- so i grabbed a drink at the bar. The Patron Silver on the rocks was soooo nice and only at 11 dollars i felt like i was robbing them. We sat one table away from the window but i dont believe it really matters, as this place is quite small and every seat is phenomenal of lower manhattan and the Brooklyn Bridge. The food was priced to what i would expect this caliber of a place would be for lunch. With plates starting around 15 dollars a plate it was more than reasonable for this NY legend. The food was really good, but i never felt that WOW factor like i have at places like the little owl and zaytinya. However this is a must if you live in NY or are visting, the ambiance alone is worth the pricetag., simply amazing., We went for restaurant week lunch and the food was amazing. The view is, of course, awesome. I had my back to it but I have a great view from my apartment so I was willing to sacrifice that. This was a rather random gathering of people but we are all in the same profession so conversation was lively and fun. The food portions were on the small side but for the price we did just fine. 3/4 of the table had the wild boar ravioli which was delicious and one had the scallops which were also perfectly cooked and creamy in the center. All the courses were wonderful, but petite. There was plenty of bread though and a couple of gin and tonics to set sail. Not sure this would be my first choice because of quantity but if you want a place to convey a feeling or mood for something special happening in your life, this is the spot. And wear a jacket for gods sake. Yes, even if its lunch., I took my boyfriend there for his birthday and it was absolutely amazing. Service was great and food was even better. I didnt even care about the price, when food is good, money is not a problem. I will definitely go back, I was nervous before eating here because of all the hype. Thankfully, in my view, it was all worth it. My husband and I enjoyed a glorious anniversary dinner here. The banquette tables are set up so that we were able to sit next to each other and enjoy the glorious view. All of the food was delicious, from the amuse bouche to the desserts. We had a lovely bottle of wine as well as some history of the vineyard from the sommelier. It aint cheap, but its great for a special occasion. Overall, it was a fabulous way to spend our first anniversary. Well definitely go back., I found this place pretentious and pompous because having gone there with reservations for 12 and only 11 able to show, they didnt want to seat us. I think that kind of sucks, but what do I know? We left and went to Totonnos Pizza (read my review) instead., Im always leery about restaurants with a gimmick, say maybe the fact that they rotate, or have a great view. Well, River Cafe wasnt good just for a restaurant with a view, but was a genuinely pleasurable dining experience.We started with the Ceviche of Taylor Bay Scallops, which was very enjoyable, as was the initial bread. For the main course we had the Crisp Duck Breast and the Branzino Fillet, both of which were delightful. The duck breast was an Asian fusion-type of dish, with a tangy and savory sauce. The sea bass was interesting, topped with a crispy layer that was a nice counterpoint to the smoothness of the fish. Add in the nice view, and all in all I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here., Whenever I want to indulge in spectacular food, spectacular views and good service, I come here. Ive eaten at this restauarant a couple of times and never had a negative experience. Which reminds me to make reservations in the future., We spotted this place a few weeks back when we took a boat tour. We imagined it as a place similar to Boat Basin Cafe....boy were we wrong! We stopped in for lunch yesterday and almost turned around cuz my guy felt a little underdressed in t-shirt and tennies. But we stayed - and are so glad we did!The view was amazing, the service was friendly and attentive but not too so, and the food was amazing.We started with the Terrine of French Foie Gras served with the most perfect crostini - it was delicious.My husband had the Shellfish Trio, crabcake wih avacado, lobster ravioli (both of which he thought were under seasoned) and shrimp tempura with ponzu sauce. I had the Branzino fillet which was topped with a crispy tuffing of chorizo and shrimp -it was cooked perfectly and delightful. Good spot to take visitors and the menu was great, it was difficult to choose what to order., OK, so do you remember that scene in Terms of Endearment when Debra Winger - I mean Emma - is taken on a trip to New York by her best pal Patsy after she finds out she has cancer? They end up meeting Patsy patronizing friends for lunch at a posh restaurant...PATSY: Emma, this is Lizbeth.EMMA: Hi, Elizabeth.LIZBETH: Hi. It Lizbeth.EMMA: Isn that what I said?LIZBETH: You said Elizabeth. It Lizbeth.EMMA: Oh, two names? Liz Beth?LIZBETH: No, one. Lizbeth.EMMA: Lizbeth?LIZBETH: Never mind.PATSY: And this is Jane.EMMA: Thank heavens!Well, they met at the River Cafe, and ever since I saw Debra Winger talk about dealing with the tragedy of her cancer in front of the Twin Towers across the river (...a foreboding and somewhat ironic sight when you see it now), I had this hankering to come here...especially when I saw the strawberry shortcake Debra WInger was about to devour. I knew it was going to be a pricey place, so it would take the right occasion to justify the cost.So Jamie W. and I took a trip to NYC together this past weekend to see Young Frankenstein (a present from him to me) and have a nice meal at the River Cafe (a present from me to him). A 2PM Saturday lunch was the only reservation I could get on short notice, but it turned out to be a comparatively good deal, a prix-fixe per person of $45, a full $40 less than dinner.It actually a modest place size-wise, a floating barge simply and tastefully decorated and surrounded by a garden that past bloom this time of year. We were seated next to the window in order to take in the view of the Brooklyn Bridge (see photo). We were immediately served a complimentary appetizer, homemade granola in cream inserted in an eggshell cracked open and nestled in an egg holder (see photo). A tasty loaf of nutty cranberry bread was left for us to munch on while we perused the menu.For our appetizers, Jamie went for the devastatingly good Crab and Shrimp Duet, fresh Maine crabmeat wrapped in a cucumber and floating in a citrus-sesame dressing coupled with five crispy marinated shrimp with chili and ginger (see photo). I ordered the very fresh Ceviche of Taylor Bay Scallops, five modest scallops topped with sea beans, tomato and coriander sprouts presented on top of a silver tureen filled with crushed ice (see photo).The entrees were even more impressive. Jamie had the Duck Steak and Egg, which consisted of a crispy duck breast topped with marinated red peppers and sauted pearl onions, a coddled duck egg embedded in a pastry shell, a wild mushroom hasseursauce and a grilled duck sausage (see photo). Wow. Mine was the equally grand Prime Sirloin and Short Rib, slices of charcoal-grilled sirloin on top of russet potato puree and a braised short rib shredded and mixed in a Pinot Noir sauce and topped with a poached egg with Hollandaise sauce (see photo). Decadently carnivorous.We decided to share a dessert after all that, and we picked a winner with the Goat Cheese Cheesecake, which came with a passion fruit sauce and a refreshing peach sorbet (see photo). Throughout the meal, we shared a bottle of Italian Prosecco, a relative bargain for $35 and just as bubbly as a first-rank champagne. What a perfect afternoon...I guess we could forget about going to the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory next door for a scoop, eh.FOOD - 5 stars...culinary delights keep coming with no disappointments with our selectionsAMBIANCE - 5 stars...low-key formal and sedate with a spectacular view even on a cloudy daySERVICE - 5 stars...impeccableTOTAL - 5 stars...likely my best luxury-level dining experience in New York, YES on River Cafe!I went here for a romantic birthday dinner. My sig othe (short for significant other, a phase I loathe) was generous enough to treat me to a legit fancy meal.I got there a little on time, and my date was a little late, so I had time to appreciate the nautical theme (read: tiny bathroom) and the breathtaking view. Sitting at the bar, I ordered a Manhattan, because I thought it sounded classy--then I realized, Ie lived in Manhattan now for several years and the first time I order one is in Brooklyn? What a tool! Glasses for Manhattans are hella tipsy, and some dude nearly spilled my whole glass. Crisis averted though--I may be a klutz, but I pretty protective of my damn liquor.I not ashamed to admit that I loved how you sit next to each other in tables for two! So romantic! It did make me feel a little like I was on a panel of judges. Judging the skyline.The food was really great! We had lamb and venison, and quail eggs and all sorts of crap, it was all great. The only thing that was a little lame was my ice-cream, which was in the shape of the Brooklyn bridge. It looked cool though, and that counts for something.We had a $75 gift certificate, and it didn even cover the tip. You better believe I licked that quail yoke off the plate. It glam though, so if youe got the cash, go for it!|0
