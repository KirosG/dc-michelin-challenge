# michelin-challenge
Work related to the General Assembly project.

## The Approach
This project adopts a several-step approach. The initial data set was generated by
querying the Yelp Search API for restaurants in the three major cities that already
have Michelin Stars, and DC. Data was then augmented with web-scraping to generate
data points for whether or not a restaurant had received positive reviews within
the last year and how many Michelin Stars a given-restaurant had, if any. After
a sufficient data set had been generated, the code was then modeled using Sci-Kit
Learn, in particular the DecisionTreeRegressor module.

Code was written primarily in Python. All data was housed on a local MongoDB
instance.

The three code files included in this submission represent the entirety of the code
that was written in order to complete the project.

Unfortunately, it failed horribly.
