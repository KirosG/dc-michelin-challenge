I analyzed the amount of potential michelin star names by looking at NYC, SF, and Chicago star restaurants to page ratios, which was around 10-11%, 
which would suggest around 11ish restaurants for the DC debut. That being said, LA launchd with 18 restaurants. I looked at Tripadvisor restaurants to
Median income/michelin star ratios, etc to ballpark the figure. I figure less than LA, but more than 10.

I took data from NYC and took yelp reviews, and zagat ratings, and mapped against whether they had a star or not using regression analysis. Further
broke down the data wiith cluster analysis (nyc only). Price is strongest indicator, followed by yelp rating, followed by total food rating from zagat.
the ambience and service didn't matter as much but that is because it is already in the "food" dimension. 

Took Chicago michellin restaurants and used textual analysis to find key identifiers/descriptors from the zagat descriptions. Unique, creative, 
"one of a kind" and "special occasion" type identifiers were strong indicators of stars.

Backward tested the NYC data with the regression model, 82% accuracy (that being said, data set was big). Applied the same model to DC restos,
came up with 18, threw out Fogo de Chao, and a couple others because I didn't think they made the cut. Probably overbidding it at 16 starred restaurants
but if they are coming to DC, maybe they need to lower the benchmark to this city.

Looking at Chicago and NYC, there are a lot of OK restaurants for the cities that wouldn't stack up on a global scale.
